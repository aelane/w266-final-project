Two brand-name labels are my favorite, and these are one of them. 3000 labels makes them near a penny each. These labels are the same that you'll be able to get in any big office box store, but cost much less! The labels print much more clearly, print easier, and are easier to peel. I have gone back to the Avery labels. The Avery 5160 labels have been around forever, but these have been improved. Now that I have these labels, I add a little sticker next to the name to make it look more festive and it looks like its part of the label so it's fine. Also, there are so many labels (3000) in the box, that I usually give them away because after a few years they lose their sticking ability and become useless. Overall I like the Avery labels and feel confident they're going to stick to the envelope. Avery makes TrueBlock labels (coated so that they block out anything underneath the label) that I really love, so I decided to try these regular white labels too.The labels are perfectly fine. Compared to the Trueblock labels I usually use though, they seem a little thinner and weaker. While it's always possible to get cheaper labels, let's just say you'll get what you pay for with Avery. I have used Avery labels for years and always find that they are exceptional. These labels glide through the printer, are easy to peel and use. Avery makes excellent labels that do what they claim. These are premium labels at value prices. Like all Avery labels I have tried, these work great. I print individual labels and reuse the sheet again and they still work great. These are great labels which work as expected.Pros:-No jams in my inkjet or laser-Easy to peel and stick on envelopes-Nice white colorCons:-None that I can see.There's not a whole lot to say here, these are labels that print well and don't jam. These labels work great for labeling reloaded ammo boxes. Fortunately, the labels are still easy to peel off the backing sheet because of an exposed pop-up edge for each label - it's a pretty ingenious setup.Finally, for those of you who are using these as mailing labels, I've found that the glue is nearly permanent when applied to paper envelopes - so no worries there.Overall, I'm completely satisfied with this product and I highly recommend them. These classic white labels are the perfect size for addressing standard sized business envelopes (#10 size). Plus these labels integrate automatically with the labels tool that comes with Microsoft Word  (Tools > Letters and Mailings > Envelopes and Labels). Excellent labels. These labels say "Laser" but will also work in an inkject printer. The labels are designed with Microsoft Word/Works Avery templates in mind and worked great under borth. While 3000 labels may be too much for the individual user, the number might be just right for an office with a lot of mailings. These labels are very easy to use. Just prepare the labels in your Office software and set the template for Avery 5160 - then with these sheets loaded you can print and have these ready to peel off and slap on the envelopes. These labels work well for many uses. I can print 300 labels in less than a minute and each label peels off the backing easily and can be stuck to an envelope or package quickly.The drawback is, you must run a sheet of 30 labels through the printer even if you need only one label. Avery 5160 labels have been a workhorse for me for years. The generic labels might seem a lot cheaper, but these are well worth the extra dough. The Easy Peel labels are unquestionably easier to remove than the standard labels, as you simply flex the sheet and the edges of the labels in one column detach from the backing sheet as shown in the photos I've posted.If you typically print full sheets of labels, you'll be pleased with the ease of removing the labels. While the standard labels can sometimes curl, or get a damaged corner as you peel, these labels come off cleanly.But, there are two situations where the standard Avery product is still better:  printing single labels and re-using the sheet, and tearing the sheet into thirds for storage or distribution of labels.Microsoft Word (and other software) has the ability to print a single label on a sheet in the row and column specified in the label dialog. If you use Avery, you'll never have to think about labels ever again, cause they just do what they're supposed to do: print perfectly, every time. I'll be set with labels for decades.These new ones now Pop-Up when you bend the sheet making them the easiest to peel off for use,THEY"RE GREAT! It is easy-to-print labels with formatting provided free-of-charge from Avery. The Avery 5160s are the workhorse labels of our office. These Avery labels do exactly what they're supposed to.They feed perfectly, are perfectly spaced on the label sheet, are easy to peel and position.For those not familiar with how easy these Avery labels work:You simply open a Word DocumentClick on Tools; then Envelopes and LabelsSelect Avery Label 5160Type in what you want on the labeland print.In a couple of seconds you have great-looking labels. These labels do all 4 as they should. She said, "I could use labels for this. I have these labels I have to test for Vines! I got these labels thinking that the "Easy Peel" seemed kind of gimmicky...how could it really make a difference? Print your labels, fold along one of the lines, and the edges of ten of the labels are quickly exposed to make peeling super easy. But with these Avery LASER labels, my laser printer handled them perfectly. I run these labels through laser printer. So to me they are just labels that work fine - no problems but not special either. When it comes down to it, labels are just labels. These are great little labels. Enough labels in the box to last me quite awhile.... These Avery labels are excellent quality, I've never had a problem with these ripping, yet I can peel them with ease. These labels work as advertised. I've used Avery labels since my days as a mail clerk, way back in the Carter administration. I'll admit that the most use I've had on these labels are for Christmas cards and hand writing labels, but these would be great for a small business.Recommended product; another winner from Avery. I use these labels all the time. Good labels at a much better price than you'd ever find locally. I compared these Avery 5160 white labels with some off-brand labels I've used in the past. The Avery labels use their 5160 template, which is available in Microsoft Word or from the free software available for download from [...]. I recommend Avery labels for any purpose, actually. Avery labels are always great and these are no exception to that rule. When using such labels on cardboard, I recommend another brand.

Despite this, these labels maintain the Avery quality the company has been known for, and they stick well and completely to envelopes.
