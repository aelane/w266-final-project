I use a lot of labels both at home and at work, and have always favored Avery labels if for no reason other than those were the first ones I tried and they worked well. If you need to print a lot of return address labels for a mass mailing, these are what you need. I use a lot of labels and other office products. I use a lot of address labels and sometimes find that the label is larger than I would like. There is not a whole lot one can say about labels but these are strong, stick the way you want them to and are easy to remove from the sheet after printing. I'm allergic to a lot of adhesives (Pine rosin), and didn't have a problem with these. I do a lot of shipping and use an ink stamp for a return address. This will save you a lot of irritation and time when you need to print and label dozens or hundreds of items. Unlike a lot of "cheap" labels with this feature, it won't peel off at the right time, such as when it's snaking its way through your laser printer.The labels themselves hold toner quite well and don't smudge/smear/flake like some cheap labels. I get a lot of pre-addressed labels from charitable organizations, but very few of them get my name right! They have a lot of utility in the home or office. There's really not a lot else to say about them other than one of the best uses I have found.
