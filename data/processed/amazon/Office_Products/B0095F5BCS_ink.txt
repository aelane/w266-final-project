So this Pro-100 needs more frequent ink replacements than the Pro-1 printer, although it uses up the ink at a rate that is comparable to the older Pro9000 printer. But I seem to replace ink cartridges more frequently on Epson inkjet printers than on Canon printers. Then you put in the ink cartridges (of which there are (8); unwrapping, unscrewing the ink cap, and setting them into the print head, which you will have already installed prior to plugging in the printer.IF your cartridges are not seated properly in the printer, you'll see an orange light on the front of the printer. The ink cartridges are not cheap. These appear to be just regular sized ink cartridges, so that is rather expensive. I doubt that generic ink will ever be available.I have severalArt Profolio ADVANTAGE landscape with 24 pages/48 views art & photo 17x11 landscape album by Itoya - 17x11albums in which I plan to use to store my large format prints. The ink still adds up in a hurry, even with the separate cartridges, but I haven't found an inkjet that doesn't. It uses 8 ink jets, 3 for grey-scale and B/W. This is dye ink, so I was expecting good color, but I really was blown away. I'm out of ink and waiting on Amazon for a fill up. *The ink is not available at any stores in my town (Wal-mart, Office Max, etc.). The individual ink cartridges, for example, light up to let you know they've been properly installed.
