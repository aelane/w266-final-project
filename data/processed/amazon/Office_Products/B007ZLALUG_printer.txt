Replaced an HP printer because I usually go through blue really fast but the other colours not as much and my older HP has a single tri-colour cartridge. I use this printer and this low volume cart at the office for printing envelopes only. My previous printer was an HP and did not have to replace nearly so often. It works in my printer. I miss my old HP printer. That printer lasted ten years.This ink is no more affordable than others. My Epson WF-2540 is a great printer and uses these easy to install cartridges. I personally hate printer. I purchased this to work with my Epson printer. The printer works great and the cartridges have ink in them. The printer produces great colored printouts so I'm sure these ink cartridges will do just fine. I have a printer that requires this ink. I purchased a new Epson printer... and of course you HAVE to purchase all the ink to go with it. This is what the printer uses, it&#8217;s what I am constrained to buy. I have a great little printer and the Epson ink makes it continue to run just fine. The printer works well and I'm happy.
