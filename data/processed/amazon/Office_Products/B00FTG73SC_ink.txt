It does what it's supposed to do but wow those inexpensive ink cartridges don't last very long!!!! Blam-- they use up ink so fast that unless I have an extra supply on hand it is VERY frustrating, Granted- you can visually see how much ink you have as you are printing - via a popup, which is a great feature, BUT even if I have very little tricolor but still have lots of black ink I am unable to print something in black and white -- NOTHING comes out but a blank sheet of paper. I'm hesitant to keep this because between the ink and paper each page costs around $3 to print and that's a lot considering the poor quality. The individual ink cartridges are not wildly expensive and it helps that you can replace a single cartridge at a time. Yes, the ink runs out quickly but its a small printer with small cartridges. I'm  loving the ink as it dries fast. I found the ink pretty affordable considering you can chose to purchase one single certain color cartridge at a time instead of an entire combo back when needed.The LCD screen on the printer is clear and easy to navigate. That will eat all your ink, and then it will tell you you need to do it again.The wifi is crap. However, when I ordered I went ahead and ordered the generic ink that is available on Amazon for a fraction of the cost and it works great. The four ink cartridges do not have the standard capacity of regular ink cartridges. it still works well but it goes through ink like crazy. I just hope the ink lasts. Also, the black ink is just running low, whereas the color ones still have lots of ink left. And the black ink only cost about $13 here at Amazon. It uses four Epson 200 ink cartridges--one black, one yellow, one cyan and one magenta. Currently, to replace all ink cartridges would cost $37, if bought here at Amazon. The ink is of course pricey, I ordered a laser printer at the same time to do most of my printing, its just more economical at 300 bucks for the cartriges and 3000 pages of printing. And if I find that the ink is that kind that evaporates if I'm not using it? You may be able to get cheap re-fillable ink that is compatible with this printer, but I haven't had much success doing that on other Epson printers).Overall: High quality printer at a great price.

Re-manufactured ink is so tempting because of the price difference, but I am convinced that it has killed at least 5 printers in our office over the years.

I opened it, loaded the ink and put it on my wireless network.

With new ink cartridges and extremely expensive photo paper custom made by the same company, I would expect much better quality than these photo prints.No image software included.There is no photo image software included.
