The 4 print cartridges from Epson came vacuum sealed; this may suggest that I should not be surprised to see the same seeming evaporation that I swear I'm experiencing on the HP OfficeJet's new designed ink cartridges. Yes, I am sure that the print cost is less for each dot matrix than for a laser print which is what their advertising pins to. The Epson Workforce Pro WP-4530 Color Inkjet Wireless All-In-One (print, copy, fax, scan) is an excellent product that satisfies all of my needs (at least to-date).Everything about the product -- from its packaging through its many product features -- represents high quality. So far I find the print outs clear an colorful.The scanning and copying features are also very useful and reliable, although one must have install the software for these features to work, of course. The print quality is quite precise and clear and the ink used in the cartridges is a special, proprietary formulation (DURAbright Ultra Ink) that dries on contact and is highly resistant to smudging - a common bane of those of us who use colors and sometimes put a lot of ink on a piece of paper. The print quality is excellent with a great variety of settings.The scanner is fast, easy to use and provides excellent hi-res images. This worked better than I thought it would and the print transfer was remarkably fast. Color print quality is good.- Tons of connectivity options: ethernet, USB 2.0, WiFi B/G/N.- Supports USB thumbdrives. Fax print quality is excellent as well. Photo print quality is not good at all, very blurry results. I tried again after changing the print quality to best and the copy was an improvement, but the logo colors were still lighter. )The print times are fast for an inkjet, but I haven't timed. I think the drawer - print path design must be superior than others (We have owned almost a dozen laser printers by now).4. The print quality was about as good as I expected, in that it was higher than average. It's fast, it's economical, it has great print quality, has a good feature set...it's a perfect printer for small businesses/home offices. I did not see that small print instruction until after I put them in.

I don't have many print and scan jobs that require double sided stuff, but it's nice to know it's there just the same.Here's some remarks about the various sections of the device's functionality:Scanner:  The EPSON Scan software that gets installed during installation does the job.

Boy, what an easy print copy, scan and fax installation right out of the box for our family of Apple iMac, Mac mini, iPad and 2 pc work laptops!

The print speed also is fast so a large print job won't frustrate the network.
