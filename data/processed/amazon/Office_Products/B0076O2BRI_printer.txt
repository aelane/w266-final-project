I bought this printer to print from my iPad and iPhone. If you need this, and a printer, and a scanner, then this printer is perfect for you. If you only need a printer and a scanner, I feel you would be better served by an inexpensive sheet-fed scanner like theTaoTronicsand a tiny travel printer like theCanon PIXMA iP100. It's a reliable, fairly rugged printer that will travel well and offers HP's time tested technology. I often didn't have a printer available to me, nor did I have a power outlet. This printer actually runs on batteries, and I have yet to run out of battery on a job. The printer is not AirPlay compatible, which for a portable wireless printer is kinds' inexcusable. After unpacking the printer I read the step by step instructions.. What we like about this printer:* portability - it's hefty but doesn't take a lot of space - it weighs 6.8 pounds and its dimensions are 7 x 14 x 3.5 inches* scanner-print combination* speed of copying - print speed (draft, letter): up to 22 ppm black. The printer is blue-tooth compatible, but only with computers with Bluetooth--he wasn't able to get it to work with other Bluetooth devices like his Windows phone, but that could possibly be user error. This printer would work well as a mobile printer as well as an in-place printer. Overall, we are all very happy with this printer! You cannot print to the printer from an iPad or iPhone, despite them both being Bluetooth devices. There is no USB printer cable included so if you aren't going to use this as a Bluetooth printer or you will want to scan to a laptop, you will need to buy one. You only need to pair the printer with your laptop (or other compatible device) the first time, and the default password is 000000 for the initial pairing. It also doesn't replace a regular printer for people who must print a lot since the duty rating is 500 pages/mo maximum.I think if you are someone who travels a lot for business (truck driver, sales rep, etc.) I do own a Canon BJC-85 mobile printer with the IS-12 scanner head.
