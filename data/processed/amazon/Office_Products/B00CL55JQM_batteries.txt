It operates by 4 AA batteries (which are not included) or by plugging it into a USB port. You can use AA batteries or an AC adapter (neither are included), but for me, the USB is much better. I don't have to worry about dead batteries, and I don't have to keep the thing plugged into my wall or occupying my desk.The canister for shavings is enough to sharpen about ten pencils from brand new to sharp. You can always use disposable batteries. Easy to clean, and uses batteries if needed. I added four AA batteries (not included) and disconnected it from the usb connection and it was much more powerful. I added the batteries and it works great, when the batteries are not an option you can plug this into any USB and continue to sharpen pencils. It takes four batteries which is a bit much. It will work with batteries or connected to a USB port. It also operates on four AA batteries, but I recommend using the USB connection, since it is economical. Sure, I could have dug out some batteries to try it, but this was advertised as a USB pencil sharpener, and I wasn't about to let it get away with working like a normal battery-powered device. It will also run on 4 double 'A' batteries if you are so inclined. Our Amazon Basics rechargeable batteries fit and work well in this sharpener.It's an attractive sharpener and doesn't take up much space on the desk. I haven't gotten batteries for it yet, so I can't review it when it's battery powered. It also uses 4 AA batteries, which is definitely reflected in the torque this thing has.When and if it's working of course. No batteries needed, yeah.
