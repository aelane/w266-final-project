This board allows you to at a glance keep track of four months worth of commitments. And yes, the board has sturdy hanging pieces on the back so that you can nail this good tool to the wall. This 4-month dry-erase board is so awesome, everyone in my family wants one! The board is very functional and can be used in many ways:*School calendar (vacation days, early-release days, projects, social events)*Sports calendar (use different marker colors for each team event)*Work calendar (plan projects, holidays, vacation, travel)*Blogging calendar (plan articles, giveaways, guest authors and events)*Family calendar (use one "month" for each family member)The 4-month dry-erase planner board comes with one thin black marker. This large dry-erase board allows you to keep track of 4 months at a time. The board was amazingly lightweight, but solid, for its size. The board I found to be pretty light and reasonably durable for the price. At first I was driving myself crazy and *attempted* to change the board monthly, but soon realized that was a waste of time and I actually like to refer back to past events and see what was completed, etc.This board is thin, light, and a bit flimsy. The board is easy to erase with a dry paper towel. The board is not magnetic, which we miss from our previous one-month board. I recommend this board; it is very useful and convenient. I own another white board which came with a marker and an eraser on the marker cap, which I think is a cool and handy feature.When it came to installing the board, it took me flat 5 minutes. The board includes one black pen as well, but I quickly added others to color coordinate more efficiently. I love this board. This is my first Quartet Planning Board, and I'm glad I picked this particular planning board for my uses!Year after year, I purchase paper planners to keep me better organized, and year after year, they go pretty much unused. With this planning board, while yes, I WILL have to take the time to properly fill the dates in for each of the months displayed, I can just wipe it clean each quarter, and move on to the next chunk of my year. This 4-Month Dry-Erase board makes a great addition to my home office. I LOVE this board! The board is indeed very helpful, I am using to hang in my work office. The board also has a marker holder and I put a marker in it. Since the board is big in size, there is good room to write in the day boxes. I like that this board is larger than most because it is easy to fill in and see at a glance 4 different areas. I am very pleased with this board. Only small negative is the board is a bit thin and prone to bending and warping. This board is large and smooth.

I am currently using my board to set up our Spring and Summer homeschool activities, outings, books to be read, and more.

This board in my opinion  is one of the best ways to set up your schedule in advance.

The white board surface allows for the ease of moving things around with simple erasing and re-writing.
