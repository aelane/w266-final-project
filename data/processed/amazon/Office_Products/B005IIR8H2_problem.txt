We have not had one single problem with it. The problem was that I hadn't. I noted a brief problem trying to install the Fax capabilities under Snow Leopard initially, but this problem vanished after I installed the latest software that I downloaded from Epson's support site.In summary, there were some very minor issues as described above, but overall this is a strong entry from Epson that will work quite well in both a small office and the well-networked home office. This could be a problem in placing your printer. I'm beginning to think this is an isolated problem on this machine since none of the others have experienced similiar issues. The problem is that the driver will not let you. No problem! The problem is installation took an hour on my PC. Epson says, "not their problem, talk to Adobe".Constant reminders of updates, which can't be installed since you are prompted for a password before downloading and again before installing. !The problem is, I have several computers and the update warning comes up frequently on all of them.To load paper, the entire tray has to be pulled out, not just the tray cover as with HP.So, sucky software and totally useless tech-support, poor design, but works and prints well. In researching the problem on the internet, I found that this seems to be a relatively common defect for the printer.
