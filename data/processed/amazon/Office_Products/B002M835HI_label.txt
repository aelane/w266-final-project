With this label, it seems to have a second layer of gray paper underneath the white to block anything. As my DHL label stock diminished, I decided to give these labels a shot and have been very pleased. The label lining up with the template and sticking are really the two things I'm concerned with so I'm pleased.I do want to note, they don't work for UPS labels (at lease UPS labels printed through Paypal). So, if you ship UPS, you may need to find a label with a different layout. The label really does a superb job of covering up old labels. It is an efficient and very convenient label, which would be especially suited to those who use USPS or Ebay and print postage from their computers. What I don't understand is why this label is half-sheet with the other half being plain paper and yet it costs a bit more than even standard full sheet labels. I love not having to waste a half-sheet label on shipping information...or having to use regular paper and tape the entire label on the package.That said, these are a BIT expensive for my taste. Whats nice is that I can have both the label and a receipt from the same label. You get both a label and confirmation tab so you can send out the tracking ID with ease! It's a great label if you do a bunch of package shipping for sure. Perfect for printing a Priority Mail label and receipt from USPS - as well as ebay/paypal USPS and UPS shipping labels. Just peel off the label, and tear the receipt along the perforation.Whether they are worth the cost depends on your volume of shipping, or whether you  just don't want to deal with cutting and taping, or prefer the professional look of  these labels.The only surprise with this product is that someone didn't come up with this sooner. When you use them over an existing label they totally cover with no show thru barcodes. You get one label per sheet and the bottom is your packing slip or in my case my record and tracking number. Over $0.50 per label before ink seems a bit steep to me. The label itself has one side for the label and another plain sheet for receipts. I'm happy to report that I was able to get the label on wrinkle-free and it truly did block out the printing on the other label completely. The label has an adhesive backing which is very convient. This is a simple to use Avery label that is sized large enough to easily cover hard-to-remove labels on perfectly fine mailing containers. We have found that printing the label and purchasing the postage this way are many times more convenient than going to the post office, dealing with (our grumbly) postal clerk, and paying adds lots of effort and takes more time. Now we simply put the label into the printer, order up the postage and label, print it and stick it! They're simple to use, and the label turns out nice and clear with the bright white paper.I have two complaints about this product: First, that 25 sheets is a small amount for a single package, but I guess when you're getting that extra paper receipt, it costs a little more for a little less. Very nice heavy label will conceal previous printing errors. The label is opaque enough to cover anything underneath, and they seem to stick well (though I have put tape on curling edges before). I just feed them in and the label section prints perfectly, leaving me with the receipt on paper on the bottom, which is way better than having the receipt be on label paper and having to cut everything out, etc. I don't know if this is specific to the PayPal label and they want to make this paper more universal than that.2. Normally, you print out the USPS label to a standard 8.5x11 sheet of white paper, cut it out, and use a glue stick to adhere it to the box. When printing using a full sized label sheet, half of the page with adhesive is wasted. With the Avery Shipping Label with Paper Receipt, print the label and you are left with a thin paper slip for your records. This Avery label saved me. The label sticks on the shipping label that was already attched on a box pretty tight and the Avery called it aTrueBlock technology. And the printed Avery label looks more professional than putting the printed label on a normal paper with a tape all over it.Only the bad things is its price.O
