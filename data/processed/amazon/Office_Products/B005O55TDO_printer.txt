I bought this as an ultra-cheap SOHO printer that I hoped would be adequate for my sometime use as a solo practitioner attorney. Once I restarted the printer the fax lights corrected themselves. So a great printer overall, with the plus of duplex (2 sided) printing.Cons: longevity in question (or did I get a lemon the first time); it is an absolutely huge footprint (takes up a third of my desk space); will go to sleep on occasion and not awaken for printing; no accessory feed (so you have to load the photo paper or envelopes in the paper tray after removing the paper and resizing).Pros: good print quality; long life of print cartridges; wireless and compatible with Mac and iPhone effortlessly Had to replace my all in one printer we use at home. It is cheaper just to buy a new printer than to try to fix etc...This printer is great.... can print from my smartphone no matter where my cell phone is and because the printer is wireless, it goes through my house Wi-Fi. This is a BIG printer, much larger than the Brother all-in-one we were replacing, but it fits on the printer table.I'll update this review if we have anything good or bad to report. This printer is so quick and now I only have to buy 2 kinds of ink! This is a fantastic printer for multiple daily prints. I only wanted a printer but it's hard to get an inkjet printer alone these days so I went for the HP 8600. This is the first printer I ever had that was not tied to my computer. Just send an e-mail to your printer I will never buy another HP printer. Had this printer for 3 months and went to replace the cartridges and keep getting an error. I got this printer for Christmas, and I'm glad to see that it was so inexpensive, because I more or less can't use it.I have spent the past week trying to get it to stay connected to my  network. If I want it to connect, I have to restart the printer. The printer.

My old HP printer stopped working, so I got this one to replace it.

This printer has an automatic document feeder, fax machine (which I do not use), and automatic double sided copy.The printer prints relatively fast, it takes a few moments (about 3 seconds) after you send the document for it to wake up, and then it starts printing and takes about a second or two for normal pages (one page) (simple text document).

However, I reprinted it and told it (Mac printer Options under Presets) that the paper was PhotoPaper and it printed fine (kind of slow), but it did print on the card stock with no jam or problem.
