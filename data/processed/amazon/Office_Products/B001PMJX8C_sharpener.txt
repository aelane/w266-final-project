The sharpener may be damaged if operated with an overfilled receptacle." Once started, the sharpener will feed the pencil automatically. I really like this sharpener. When I compare this sharpener which is currently priced at $19.99, this is a much better deal.It sharpens the pencils fine. "I really liked this at first -- the sharpener takes in the pencil, sharpens it automatically, then ejects it when it is finished. I couldn't believe it...it just killed the sharpener. This little sharpener takes the guess work out of sharpening pencils. The sharpener pulls the pencil into the hole and into contact with the spinning blades until the pencil is sharp. But if you're looking for a sharpener that does the job with a minimum of effort for an office or classroom (or home if you're just not into cranking), the X-Acto is hard to beat. Do we even need an "automatic" sharpener?Far too often this thing just keeps going and going. When using an older electric sharpener you'd hear the change in sound when the sharpening was done.

The sharpener obligingly pulled it inside and sharpened it, but was unable to eject it.

So, our sharpener is useless until I can find tweezers small enough to pry out the short pencil.I wish I'd seen the pencil before it was inserted, so I could provide guidance for avoiding a similar calamity,  but alas, I did not.

Eventually, I got the sharpener, pencil, power cord, and sharp knife juggling act down and was able to pry out the pencil with the reverse motor's assistance.
