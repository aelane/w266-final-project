I used Bic highlighters last semester. I also have 2 yellow highlighters that I keep at home, but in case I don't get it back.I have a variety of colors because I tend to color code my textbooks. I love these highlighters. Don't settle for other highlighters that will only last half as long and dry out quickly. If you haven't used Sharpie yellow highlighters before I don't know what rock you have been living under, but crawl out and try them! They are the best highlighters I have ever used. So far these highlighters are great even though I am still on the first one. I bought these highlighters obviously to highlight important text in textbooks for the class I'm taking. These are full-sized highlighters, and you get 12 of them for a great price.

I have used the Sanford highlighters for close to 20 years.

They are smaller than your average sized highlighters but they get the job done.

Cute highlighters, children love them and it helps.
