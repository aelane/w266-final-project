The markers write smoothly and evenly. I find that the Quartet markers can better make thin lines in comparison to the chisel tip Expo markers. The Expo markers have a softer tip that has more give, so thin lines on the chisel tips are harder to achieve. The Quartet markers do have a smell, but your nose has to be less than an inch away from the nib to smell a light chemical smell. I wish that the Quartet markers had a semi-hard top part to make it more durable, but it has not ripped on me yet.Just for the low odor alone, I would purchase the Quartet markers or the low odor Expo markers because I can't imagine what kind of harm it could do to the respiratory system. If not, you may be better off buying what you need separately.The markers are in the same ballpark as Expo chisel-tips. The Quartet markers are a little too skinny to fit in, however, the top of their cap has three small protrusions. These Quartet markers don't seem to have the purity as some of the others I've tried. They don't run out as quickly as Expo markers I've used in the past. However, with these markers, it really isn't necessary that often. The markers come in the basic colors of black, blue, red, and green. The markers are easy to write with and equally easy to erase, especially with the cleaning fluid. I take the markers spray, and board eraser to my school library's study rooms (where they have whiteboards) and use it to draw on the board when I'm with my group. So far, the markers write great, the eraser erases just fine (except when the mark made by the marker is still too wet, which causes streaks to appear), and the fluid cleans the board just fine. I loved that these markers were also not that chunky making them easier to write with than others I have used. Great markers, they leave bright marks on a dry-erase board. As for the markers, the black is bold, but the other colors are not bold at all, more like pastels. I use dry-erase markers all the time with my tutoring students, and I'm very happy with the way this set works. The markers work great. You can't use standard (Permanent) felt tip markers. The markers have a low odor &#34;ink&#34;. These markers are very nice, providing a thick bold look that is easy to read from a distance and has minimal fading. Still, I would say these markers are slightly better than average when compared to other products on the market.Also included is a bottle of cleaning spray and an eraser. I tried the markers out and found them to be clear but a bit on the thin side. The markers appear to be decent quality, but we are not talking anything super great. I use mostly Expo markers on it. The markers have been working really well throughout the course of this month and the eraser is still working well too (some white board erasers get gummed up extremely quickly and just serve to spread the ink around instead of wiping it off, but so far that has not been the case here). The markers are bright, they write smoothly on the board. I like carrying my owns markers rather than to depend on having something available when I enter the classroom. The markers work nicely, and the eraser erases pretty cleanly. These markers worked well enough, but I have other Quartet markers from another set that I like better. The markers and eraser work well, but considering the lower price of the Expo set, and all else being equal, I would have to recommend that set over this one. These are great dry-erase markers that work quite well. The markers don't have a strong odor and have a mid-sized tip for fine writing or large drawing.

The new markers were clear and the red, green, blue and black colors distinct.This is one of those handy things that takes care of business with no muss or fuss.

It works fine with my other markers.
