These folders came at just the right time. The folders are well made and not flimsy. I hate flimsy cheap folders. These folders are sturdy and will be around years from now. These folders will hold a ton of paper files. These folders are not inexpensive, at $4+ each, and are not meant to replace manilla folders. I'd use the folders to keep same case witness information in the same place. The folders made it very easy to flip through & find what I wanted during court appearances and when writing/answering pleadings.I also use the folders to keep credit card statements in one file (ie, business credit card, personal credit card, gas credit card, etc.). 2.75 inch Base, Box of 100 (99855).These folders also come in legal size. These folders are sturdy; much more so than the typical manila folder. Unfortunately, these folders have several drawbacks. Get them organized in these coloful folders, labeled and put away where you can find them later in the year. At first, I didn't like these folders because of the cheap pages inside, which I had thought would be sturdy, solid colored folder like the outside, and they are not. I really liked these expandable folders. I have always used loose manila folders to organize inside larger folders, but that becomes bulky fast. These are bright and sturdy; just folders with tabs, but they do the job, and I do enjoy working with bright, cheerful colors in any product. The folders can hold quite a bit of paper.If I can somehow close the sides of the folder ...bdaa-bing! These folders shall become my weapons against health care fraud and those that purvey it.So for instance yellow folder will be "CARDIOLOGY" ... doc writes down the secret codes ... but with a little help I know what the chicken scratch writing said:2011 ICD-9-CM Diagnosis Code 782.3 = Edema2011 ICD-9-CM Diagnosis Code 794.31 = Nonspecific abnormal electrocardiogram (ecg) (ekg)2011 ICD-9-CM Diagnosis Code 786.51 = Precordial pain- Precordial pain is pain in the chest wall over the heart.Blue folder can be drug reactions: Celebrex ALONE can cause massive edema over time .. add that to a mix of ten drugs and you've solved your own problems. Fabulous folders from a well known brand name - sturdy and eyecatching, these folders will last longer than the paper you put in them. These folders are perfect for complex subjects needing sub-filing. Really great folders. I really like these folders. It's hard to know exactly what to think of these folders. How easy are the folders to use, how well do they suit my intended purpose, and how will they stand up to sometimes rigorous office use?Taking the second criterion first, the folders are very sturdy and very well made. While I haven't used the folders for a long enough period of time to see if this will indeed happen, it looks unlikely. Overall, then, I'd have to say that the folders rate right at the top for durability.Unfortunately, I can't say the same for utility. I think you'd be better off buying separate, single-purpose folders. These are very well-made folders that will last a long time.

These folders are well worth the price.

Some folders gradually break apart in this area, but these folders have reinforcement to extend their useful life.

This is nice because it means the folders will expand a little bit to accommodate more paper.
