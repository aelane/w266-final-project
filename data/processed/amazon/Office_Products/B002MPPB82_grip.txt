Thankfully, due to the "easy grip" finish on the tops of the pockets, I don't have to worry about gripping them very hard, as they keep from slipping without exhausting all of my strength and energy. The "easy grip" stuff feels like a rubbery, sort of "adhesive on the back of a sticky note"  feel to it. With the easy grip, this problem is minimized. The slightly sticky grip on the top few inches of both side of the folders make them easy to grab, even when stuffed. Easy to use, grip and very sturdy. I love the grip strip at the top of each. The grip strips on the top of the pockets do the job, allowing me to maintain a firm grip on the file when I move it around as needed. The grip on the top makes it easy to pick up with one hand without worrying about having it slip out of your hand.

This "easy grip" feature of this letter sized folder does indeed make it rather easy to grasp it and pull it out of a drawer in a file cabinet or off a shelf on which you store paper documents in folders such as these.

It is rather well made and I like that "easy grip" feature."

BTW, the grip top is a basically a thin coating of some rubberized material, similar to cell phone cases, that is a actually a nice innovative perk of this product.
