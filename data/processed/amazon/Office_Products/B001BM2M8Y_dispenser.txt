I do like the dispenser enough to make a point of buying the tape that fits it in the future; it's just that it's never handy to have to seek out a specific size and brand of a staple office supply. So Scotch is giving away the dispenser, and then making it up on the tape refills.I gave it 3 stars for the above reasons, but if someone wants a tape dispenser to keep in their kitchen drawer for the occasional taping chore, with a little finagling, it will suffice. This handy dispenser is very well-made with a nice cushioned, 3 inch handle that allows you to put some distance between your knuckles and the box you are wrapping. A great little dispenser! The dispenser is very easy-to-use one-handed, and the hand grip is pretty comfortable. I like that this dispenser does enclose the tape to keep it clean and it is much lighter and compact than the commercial/business type dispenser. The dispenser enclosure is easy to open and load with most wide tapes, and it is very straightforward to position the tape in a proper configuration. The whole dispenser is very solidly built out of high-quality plastic and is not likely to break. This dispenser is particularly useful for those who need to pack a lot of items all the time, but it comes handy even for casual users. Best dispenser I have used. As for the dispenser, I found it better than the free-on-roll tape dispensers but inferior to the mailroom monsters. A more sturdy dispenser (one made of metal) with larger tape rolls would need to be used for large businesses where an abundance of packing is done on a more frequent basis. Overall this dispenser is better than going without; however, it is not as easy to use as the heavy-duty dispensers you see at mailing companies.The good:1. Then arrived my new Scotch dispenser and what a wonderful addition to the household helper inventory. I also felt that the actual dispenser might not last long under rigorous use. I wanted this dispenser because we are going to paint the entire inside of the house, meaning I am going to have to box up practically everything as if we were moving. This dispenser is ok for sealing boxes, if you're holding it horizontally to tape the top of a box. I can store the dispenser and when I pull it out from the cabinet again, the tape end is right where it belongs. The easy-grip dispenser is the kinder-gentler take on that product. I would prefer it over the larger dispenser for its ease of use. I do not know how long this dispenser will hold up as there are a few parts that look like they could crack easily, hence a one star deduction. * The dispenser does not allow you to add tension to the roll as you apply the tape. I had been struggling with my current red dispenser and was irritted that the tape easily and repeataly kept falling back on the roll making it time comsuming to use. The dispenser covers the tape roll completely, so you can store the dispenser loose in a drawer without it collecting debris along the sticky edge. This dispenser uses the thicker tape which is best for packing. This dispenser is light weight, fits into the hand very comfortably, and is easy to use (industrial tape dispensers hold more tape and are much heavier). Well this dispenser solves the problem with a bit of elegance and rounded edges for the occasional shipper. The dispenser cuts extrememly well, fits nicely in my hand, and is lightweight. This dispenser is not really intended for the heavy use of commercial applications, but for occasional home use such as moving one's household or shipping an occasional gift, for which it is perfect.
