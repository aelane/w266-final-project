No more waiting for the ink basket to slide over. For standard ink cartridges they cost $22.99 each and you need 4, or $87.05 for a combo pack at the Epson Store. It has four individual ink cartridges (black, cyan, magenta, and yellow). The initial ink process was really slow (compared to others), it took it around 15-20 minutes. The ink cartridges are enormous, but I really don't believe all that volume is dedicated to ink. I held the semi-translucent ink cartridges up to the light and it seemed like I could see a somewhat normal sized cartridge embedded inside. It makes me wonder if it really holds so much ink. However, these ink cartridges aren't cheap. And that the ink tanks hold large inks.Overall, this is a nice choice for a small business or home office! The ink cartridges are the easiest to load ever. The ink has expiration dates, and once it hits that, every time (I mean EVERY TIME) I want to print I have to cycle through several warnings that the ink needs replaced even though it prints just fine. I'm not throwing away a full ink cartridge just because it's expired. I went through ink cartridges regularly which was pricey.I am thrilled to have this Epson because it has made my life so much easier especially when sending and receiving faxes.It's sturdy, very sturdy and so far I have not had one problem when using it and the finished product, be it something copied or a photograph copied, the results are absolutely great! It just takes a few minutes.Installing the ink cartridges is very easy, as the compartment is accessible from the front, and they slide right in with a gentle push that locks them into place. It is also quite noisy while it processes the ink carts, so it is best to leave the room and come back later.Using the printer is also very easy.
