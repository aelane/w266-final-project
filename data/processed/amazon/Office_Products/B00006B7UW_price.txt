But the asking price here (the MSRP is over a hundred bucks!!!) Even Amazon's considerably lower price seems way out of line for what this is. I remember when $100 ($65 Amazon price) actually bought something. But, that might have driven the price up to $150? But, really, I can't get over the price to function ratio. Also, the price is too much for what you get. It should either be better designed or half the price. And I don't mean half the list price; I mean half the $60 Amazon price. Why pay this price for such an inadequate unit?

For this price a few extras should have been included.

Although, it is very nicely built, the price still seems a bit high.

For the price I expected better (as did some other reviewers).
