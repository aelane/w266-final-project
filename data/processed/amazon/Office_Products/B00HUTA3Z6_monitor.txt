This is my second monitor arm system, and I disassembled my3M Easy Adjust Desk Mount Dual Monitor Armto put this one in place. It is sturdy, holds my (admittedly very light) 24" monitor without any problems, and swivels around nicely. Once I threaded my monitor (Samsung had neglected this step), it was easy to mount the monitor on the bracket. And the monitor moves around relatively freely with a light push. I love this monitor arm. It is heavy and sturdy, and it holds my 20-inch ViewSonic monitor with no problem (and it can definitely handle an even bigger monitor). This may be a no-brainer for many out there, but we have never installed a monitor arm before, so it would have been nice if the manual had indicated this.Overall, though, it is a good quality monitor that I would recommend. I recommend attaching the monitor attachment/monitor first and to test out the knob screws ahead of time that will work on back of your monitor (all monitors are different as the 24" inch Samsung S24C230L that I use only will allow for two knob screws, some may use four).Attaching to a table is very easy and overall setup goes quickly. This is a durable, easy to setup adjustable monitor arm.Recommended! This is a great monitor mount. I was surprised at how sturdy this monitor arm feels straight from the box. I had thought my monitor had a fairly compact footprint, but it's amazing how much more useable space is created when using this arm. This made the monitor difficult to tilt. My monitor is a 27&#34; professional heavy monitor. I guess I care more about my monitor than my desk! Remove your monitor stand, attach with the standard VESA mounting option available on pretty much all monitors I can ever recall seeing and enjoy! Additionally it is solidly constructed and holds the monitor firmly. My monitor used to sit so low I had to put books under it, but my neck would still be sore after hours at the computerIt was super easy to set up. I have used several adjustable monitor arms at work throughout the years, and I can say that the 3M Easy Adjust Desk Mount Monitor Arm is the best and easiest one to use of them all. The monitor arm comes in four separate boxes, which may seem a little aggravating at first, BUT it has been my experience that keeping the parts separate like this minimizes the dings and scrapes that can occur when everything is in the same box. It works great, is easy to attach, easy to mount your monitor on, and is easy to use.It looks good too :) This monitor arm is VERY versatile!The advantages of this monitor arm are:(1) It helps to free up desktop space by "hovering" your monitor over your desk. This is perfect because my current monitor stand does not move up or down or anywhere. With this I can push my monitor out of the way to see the person sitting behind my desk and to show the screen to them as well. It is very easy to setup and mount the monitor to a comfortable height. I never really thought about getting a monitor arm before this. The monitor arm allows you to position your monitor exactly where you need it. You can swing your monitor in any position that works for you. Quite capable of holding my monitor and it says monitors up to 20 lbs. If you're looking for a monitor arm, I highly recommend this. Before purchasing make sure your monitor has the holes require to attach to the arm. I wanted to take this to work to use buy my older Dell monitor did not have the holes. I'm using this on the monitor I have in my music studio. My monitor is a 21&#34; wide screen. I use the monitor both for my computer, and sometimes to watch videos. This monitor arm is very sturdy and the quality is top-notch. I attached my 21' widescreen LCD monitor here and it looked and worked nicely. You should make sure that your monitor has so called a VESA mount (75*75mm or 100*100mm) to be attached to this arm. Before I installed the monitor on it, the tension of the upper arm with a spring was very strong. However, once I mounted the monitor, I realized that the tension of the spring was just right. Still, $200 for the monitor arm is quite pricey for most people and I wish more people enjoy the flexibility and the ease of operation of this product by having an affordable price.
