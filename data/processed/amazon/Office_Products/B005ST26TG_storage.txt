I really only intend to use this as a storage box for some paper clutter around the house, like papers from high school that I might need later on, so I the waterproof and fireproof are merely bonuses to me compared to say a filing cabinet. As it is, its just a very heavy storage box to hold a lot of legal size semi valuable documents. The Sentry GB20L Guardian Storage Box is a fairly small, heavy, fireproof storage box for your personal belongings. Despite being quite expensive, if you're looking for a fireproof storage box, I can recommend it. It's a good safe storage option. If they do upgrade these storage boxes, I think it would be great to add a way to padlock it shut. For now, I'm using the storage box to hold important family mementos, discs of stored digital photos, and a hard copy of my genealogy files. This storage box provides air tight security to protect all your files and important papers and valuables. I love this storage box. This storage box is just the right size for safe storage of important documents in your home. A very basic storage box that hopefully would withstand a fire. The Sentry storage box will likely do neither.
