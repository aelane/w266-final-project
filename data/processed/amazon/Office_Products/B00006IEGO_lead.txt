And you can transfer all of the lead into just one of the containers for storage. This lead is exactly what you would expect it to be. I don't know much about lead so I can't give any details beyond: it works. I have purchased this same lead (and also the 0.5 size too for other pencils of mine) many times and just ordered 3 more packs. This lead is good quality, and predictable lead that does exactly what it's supposed to do. This lead is great for drawing or writing, HB is a firmer lead so it won't break as much but it's still dark enough to resist smudging (all lead is going to potentially smudge a little bit, but a softer lead will be darker and smudge more).Here's a list of lead grades from firm (lighter writing) to soft (darker writing):4H - 3H - 2H - H - F - HB - B - 2B - 3B - 4BThere are others but these are more commonly seen ones. This is a good lead, high quality, not too many broken in the container. Very smooth lead.

I don't know what 'high polymer lead' is, but it makes nice clear marks on paper and doesn't break very often.

This is Pentel lead, baby.

This is quality lead and in the three pack a reasonable value.
