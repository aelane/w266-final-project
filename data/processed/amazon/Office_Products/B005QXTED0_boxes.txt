These are good boxes for their purpose (ornament storage) and I was able to easily fit all of my ornaments into just one of them. The boxes also look nice.They aren't difficult to put together but the instructions for assembly are weak. In one of the boxes I doubled the slats on the bottom and then put the flat cardboard separator on top. )The boxes look festive and are moderately sturdy (the cardboard could have been thicker, especially on the inserts), but there's another problem aside from the crazy assembly time:You'll have to remove the top insert to get to the bottom row, and there's no way to do that easily in one piece-- you'll probably wind up reassembling it afterwards.I've had a plastic ornament tub before. So, when I opened it and found it to be these ornament boxes unconstructed, I just settled in and began the construction process: pulling apart the divider slats. These boxes are okay once assembled, which is an IQ test in and of itself because the instructions (read pictures only) leave a lot to be desired. I am using the boxes to store fabric, plastic, brass, and wood items; the only breakables I would put in these boxes are those I can stand to lose. The boxes are sturdy; each box will hold 56 average sized ornaments. But these boxes take a lot of work because the instructions are so inadequate.Each box holds 56 standard sized ornaments. I pulled out all my brown boxes of ornaments and was able to fit them ALL in these 2 boxes. And the boxes are red and green, so they are quickly identified.

I finally figured out how to set up the boxes, and I had 4 little pieces left over....those pieces were not shown on the instructions at all, and they don't really fit anywhere logical, so I just didn't use them.Besides the hassle of setting up the boxes, they seem very durable and sturdy.

The boxes will be great for storing my ornaments, but they were so annoying to assemble!

Update 12/14/12: The boxes survived a year's worth of shuffling around, and so did the ornaments inside.
