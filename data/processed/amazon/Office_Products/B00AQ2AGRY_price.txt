If those are important to you, it's worth the price. For this price, I thought it could've done better. But beyond the price, the tape is very resilient, holding up under water when used on a flat surface. At this price point, you shouldn't have to trim corners to keep them from lifting.On the up side, other than the corners, this tape has worn very well. The price is high for this product which is the only drawback but it did a wonderful job for me.Would use again! At this price, you hate to lose 4' of tape!So far this Scotch tape has stuck well for me on any surface I throw at it. While I do not like the current price of $20.00 for one role this tape is amazing sticks well to almost anything and peels of just as easy no sticky residue. Worth the price. A price of just under $16 is not uncommon, though you can get it mainly by the case from most mail order outlets.All in all, this is a good quality tape, but it is a premium price and I think it's not particularly multi-purpose so you'd really need it for specialty situations to justify paying so much for a roll of tape and, though I think it lives up to some of its claims, it doesn't live up to them all. First at the price, but then at what they can actually do.We have a drain cover down in our woods and when we attempt to mow down weeds near it, our mower sometimes meets it as an unmovable object.

Though at the curent price of over $20.00 ... this tape is made to be made more of a permanent fixture than say masking tape.Mix it with this3M Vinyl Tape 471 (Multiple Sizes/Colors)and you've got yourself a hospital like directional markway  on your floor.

Now about the price.

Thus the price for this tape, given the quality and durability, seems about right.
