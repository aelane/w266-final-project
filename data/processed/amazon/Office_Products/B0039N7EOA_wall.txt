Unfortunately, the wall putty doesn't stick well and is a pain to use (has to be kneaded until warm then squished on wall).These Scotch Reusable strips are the best of both worlds.What I like:* Sticky like foam mounting squares, but removable (almost) like wall putty. I had a wall mounted phone plug attachment on the wall where our phone line box is. They are easy to take off the wall when I want to reposition pictures.The problem with many frames, however, is that they have no surface that gets close enough to the wall so I can use these strips. It will stick to the wall just fine (and does come off a painted wall without leaving a mark as advertised). I've never been able to do this before without damaging the wall or paint or the back of photos when I was just "sampling" placement.I immediately opened this pack, and even after cutting almost 40 small squares, I had plenty to go around. You may need to be careful when peeling them away from whatever you wanted to mount on your wall. While they stayed on the wall for my party (the "debut" of the newly remodeled bathroom), most of the photos fell down the following day or two days after being hung. Mounting them on a wall in my  studio area has been difficult before -- regular tape  peels off paper and/ or wall paint, and tacks place holes in both. It did not stick to the wall or leave a mark when I pulled it off the waytape would. I would not want to damage the wall and a tack would not go in anyway. It comes off the wall when I am done3. They even adhere to glossy wall paints, which don't always hold adhesives. It is for wall mounting and does a great job. I just pushed them back onto the wall and it's held up for the day so far.So overall very good for light papers for the wall.
