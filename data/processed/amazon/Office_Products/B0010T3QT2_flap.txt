When you unfold the little flap and fold it in, you can then put the top down to close the envelope. The little flap surely has has much paper as the strip you throw away so I don't think there's an environmental argument. They hold up well, the flap stays down, the adhesive stays sticky, and you don't have to lick them (hooray). The flap was difficult to open in one piece under normal conditions, but humidity seems to change that. The bottom flap just lifts up to reveal it.If security is a major concern for you, you may want to find envelopes that have more tamper-evident features. Instead, you simply lift a lower flap to reveal the adhesive strip, then seal as usual. I found that this small flap sometimes tore while I was trying to lift it. The tucked-over adhesive flap takes a little getting used to, but it's nice not to have to worry about that waxed paper strip that comes off of most self-adhesive envelopes, and the adhesive itself is fairly strong - it's very hard to reopen the envelope without tearing it apart. Because you have to lift the adhesive flap completely from one end of the envelope to the other, these envelopes are not as fast to use as other self- adhesive envelopes with tear- off strips. Having to lift the adhesive flap makes this envelope impractical if you have dozens of items to mail at once and need to move quickly, but for other situations, Quality Park Reveal and Seal Business Envelopes are a good choice for your mailing needs. You lift up a flap to expose the adhesive which is protected by a shiny plastic coating on the underside of the flap. Lift up a flap and stick the top down. I just flip up the flap to reveal the adhesive and I'm done! You just lift up and remove a flap which a sticker like surface and seal the top panel at the rear of the envelope and your done. You just flip up a little flap and seal the envelope. There is a narrow flap that folds up so when you fold the regular flap down the two seal together----It is like impossible to reopen the envelope. I could not open one without ripping the flap. A small flap in the sealing area is opened and it 'reveals' the glue area. you have to be careful, otherwise you'll rip the bottom flap. All you do is fold up the flap on the bottom and press down the top to it. Fold up flap and seal with your hand. After sealing it firmly, I peeled it open and inspected the flap. You simply fold up a flap with a slightly waxy strip on it that keeps the envelope from sealing itself before you are ready. Fold up the small flap to "reveal" the glue; fold down the larger flap to "seal" in your contents. Normally this is on the flap and protected by a paper strip you peel off. Unfold it, put down the flap and the envelope is sealed safely and securely.You don't have to worry about it attaching to the contents, you don't have curls of paper to throw out, you don't have to press down hard to seal -- all problems with other self-sealing envelopes.Great idea, great product. Instead, you simply lift a lower flap to reveal the adhesive strip, then seal as usual.I enjoy using this product along with my family. I was able to pull the flap up again after sealing it, or so I thought. When I attempted to open the sealed flap, it did manage to tear along one of the slits. I was able to reseal the flap without any evidence of tampering whatsoever. Seal strongly... and no more flap to lick. You have to fold up the lower flap, the one that has the special glue and then fold down the top flap. No more licking the flap to get a tongue cut, Yikes!The paper is sturdy and the envelope is well made. There is a fold down flap that has a ready to use adhesive strip that allows you to close and seal with no moistening. When opened, the flap reveals the glue and the envelope closes with little effort. You have to pull up a flap and then pull down the top part of the envelope. But - though it hasn't happened to me - I can imagine you could get irritated and try to lift the flap faster and maybe end up wrecking an envelope or two. The flap is also very easy to use - you just fold up the bottom one to reveal the adhesive, then press down on the top flap to seal it into a very strong bond. With these all you need to do is lift the flap and seal. The flap seems to be fully recyclable.2. The flap tore in clearly indicating that the envelope was tampered with.Things that were awkward but not deal breakers1. Under the flap, there is a removable strip that you peel away. You lift the flap, fold it down, and it's sealed. To seal you fold up a flap on the envelope that stays attached to the envelope and then just close the flap and press. Yeah, so I didn't really 'get' how these were secured - you raised the lower flap & used the adhesive that revealed to seal the envelope...then, if someone opened that on the sides, it was supposed to show this...um, I didn't see any secure features that are supposed to make this tamper-proof...it's supposed to say 'opened' in red if anyone tampers with it - I saw no evidence of this at all. The lower flap on the envelope has glue underneath so you just flip up the flap and then seal the envelope very easily. Instead, there's a small flap covering the adhesive which you lift to seal the envelope. This is actually cumbersome because you have to hold down the lower flap in order to get a tight seal.There are small cuts in the envelope flap so if someone tries to open your envelope, the flap will tear.The patterned interior is supposed to discourage any viewing of contents, but when put up to a light, it's fairly easy to see if you have 1 check inside. The flap also displays the word "opened" in red if the envelope has been opened. You turn the flap to close the envelope, but what's sweet about it is that although it's extremely easy to seal, it's not as easy to open. Then I had to make sure the lower flap was laying flat before I closed the upper flap over it (while avoiding getting my fingers in the adhesive). Or worse, seeing the flap unpeel before your very eyes! Just lift the flap and seal it shut. What it did do was tear up the flap so badly you could definitely tell it had been opened.Got out second envelope. If you try to pry open the flap, the perforations tear and indicating if if anyone has been tampering with your envelope.I like these envelopes both for the extra features and the overall quality of the product. Just lift the flap to expose the adhesive & seal. All I need to do is raise a flap which reveals a sticky surface. Then I fold the top flap over the sticky surface and the envelope is sealed.W
