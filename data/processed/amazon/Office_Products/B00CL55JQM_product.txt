This product is about what I expect from a pencil sharpener. I would have been pleased to review this product, but am grateful for the mistake! Amazon is shipping the wrong product. I don't know if he got the right product because mine looks exactly like the image shown.On the outside it feels cheap which is expected at the low price point, but I'd have to say that I was surprised at the strength of the sharpener when on either batteries or USB power. Very annoying.Ironically, when I first ordered this product, Amazon accidentally shipped me a different pencil sharpener, theWestcott iPoint Curve Axis Electric Pencil Sharpener for School or Office (15511). First of all, I got this product primarily due to its novelty - a *pencil sharpener* that you plug in to a computer? The product is not very strong but acceptable quality. I have rated this product three stars for its design, durability and overall satisfaction.1.X-Acto School Pro Heavy-Duty Electric Sharpener (1670)2.Stanley Bostitch Pencil Sharpener, Steel Blades, 3-1/2"x5"x4", Blue SKU-PAS9449563.Westcott Axis iPoint Evolution Electric Heavy Duty Pencil Sharpener (15509) Not for giving a product higher marks, but a lower one that could be beneath &#34;hate it&#34;, maybe &#34;WTF?&#34;I received this item with great anticipation thinking it would have made a great addition by the telephone desk. Unfortunately, I must not have received the same product as many of the other reviewers on this page, since I sharpened three pencils before I heard a rather devastating &#34;click&#34;&#8230;and now it won't sharpen a thing. Overall a great product but my favorite feature is being able to use batteries or the USB cord.
