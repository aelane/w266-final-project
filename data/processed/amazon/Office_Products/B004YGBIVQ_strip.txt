The second strip is great improvement  - recommended! These have an extra "sticky" strip about 1/2 way down the note, so the wind, or the edge of a book page, or most importantly, a copy or FAX machine or whatever can't get under the note!VERY nice to have stickies that stay put when going through a stack-loader copy machine without having to tape them down! )Very simple "upgrade", but nice to have!The extra sticky strip is far thinner than the one at the top, but it makes a difference, so especially if you use these in books, or where there is a fan or outdoors (or at a desk near a door on a breezy day), your notes are far more likely to stay put! The extra strip of glue makes these harder to quickly grab off the pad and it feels unnecessary stuck to anything. The added sticky strip is a bit up from the bottom of the sheet... that makes it easier to pick up and remove. The adhesive strip is placed close enough to the bottom to keep the note flat, but still leaves enough room to lift and remove the note easily. It's usually the top strip that doesn't hold--I think it adheres to well to the pad and curls significantly as I peel it off. With the additional adhesive strip the notes stay in place. The glue strip is 1/2 inch from the bottom of the note so they can still curl up if you want. I felt that the second strip of adhesive was an advantage.Mine were bright colors, and frankly I think lighter colors would be more useful because regular ink does not contrast well with dark colors. Pretty cool.More precisely, the second strip of adhesive is *near* the bottom of the note. The extra strip of adhesive makes it less likely that the note will move from its desired location, and it will prevent the note from sticking up and getting bent one way or another. They have a strip of stickum at the top and a strip of stickum close to, but not at, the bottom, so your post-it doesn't flap up in an annoying fashion. A second strip of sticky makes for notes that lay flatter. These add a second strip of adhesive towards the bottom of the paper just like the usual one at the top. The second adhesive strip doesn't go to the very bottom of the page. They can be removed as easily as the one strip notes, but stay put better. These are great for that.The extra sticky strip on the back of the note, though, means that I can do more with them. If the sticky strip were right at the edge, it would be hard to remove. The extra strip of adhesive at the bottom makes these stickies stay put and flat without the bottom hanging edge. The double strip sticky now leaves my notes in plain view. So you would think the extra adhesive strip that Avery added would just be a bonus feature to keep their sticky notes flat and in place. The extra strip of glue doesn't interfere in any way - and the notes stay totally readable.
