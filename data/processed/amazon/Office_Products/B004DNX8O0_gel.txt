The gel highlighter uses a smooth oval surface at the end similar to a deodorant stick. they are made from gel, twist as you use them. If you wear the gel down then just turn the top to expose more of the highlighting gel. They're translucent and fluorescent, and they work like crayons- the solid gel marks the page and wears down as it goes. I wouldn't call them gel, myself, because they are more solid than gel. I really like these gel highlighters.Pros:-They are easy to use-Don't dry out-Don't bleed through-Don't smear items printed on ink jet printersCons:-They don't leave a nice smooth edged trail like a normal highlighter does-They  can smear until the gel driesOne reviewer said that it smears pencil. I thought these would be like a gel pen, smooth writing. They are made of some weird space-age gel material resemble if anything, crayons. Using this gel highlighter feels like a smooth crayon. The gel texture is nice and smooth going on. These large gel sticks leave a thick but bright, neon-like line. They are a gel, that writes thicker, and goes on smooth. Made almost like a gel type deoderant that you use under your arms, that type of gel, but more solid. I was surprised how smooth it wrote for a gel. The gel stick seems to disintegrate rather quickly. I like a gel stick that won't dry out when compared to the "felt" style. When I saw that Sharpie had made gel highlighters I wondered what on earth they were like, and figured they couldn't be any worse than the usual run of highlighting pens.It turns out that they're miles better.

They are a firm gel that writes with the brightness of a marker.

Additionally the gel can be messy leaving fragments on the page, book, and on the desk.

The gel highlighters also do an excellent job on slick papers that are used for magazines; they do not smear since they go on dry.
