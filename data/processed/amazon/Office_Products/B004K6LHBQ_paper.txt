I ordered this paper for my small sized binder. It's just paper. Not much else to say about notebook paper. I couldn't find any other loose leaf paper to fit in my small binder. The paper is on the thin side but I consider that a plus for two reasons:  I don't want to dayplanner space on unnecessarily heavy paper; and stiff paper doesn't flip and handle well in a day planner.I bought these to replace the typical pre-printed address/phone listing type pages. The paper is college ruled and without the redline left margin so you can fit quite a bit of text onto one page. I use this paper in my daytimer planner. I don't need fancy paper. I bought this relatively cheaper paper for my more pricey Russell & Hazel mini binder. The R&H paper and accessories for this binder are quite expensive and I was looking for a cheaper alternative. This paper is good quality and price for every day uses of to do lists and general note taking and when I am done with my to-do lists,  the price makes my not feel guilty about throwing the piece of paper away!!!! love this paper and organizer they are for the Day-Timer is great I love the many ways you can create you own personal planner with adding new items to the planner

This Avery paper is thicker than the typical binder filler paper.

It feels more like copier paper.

The paper is very smooth and nice to write on.
