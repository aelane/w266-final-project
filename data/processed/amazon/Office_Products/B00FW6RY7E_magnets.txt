Also included were two circular magnets. These magnets held just fine at least keeping one sheet of paper as well as a photo or two up.I have always been impressed with Quarter home and office product and like they offer 100% Satisfaction to their customers. The included magnets are junk, we honesty just tossed them, you can purchase inexpensive "rare earth magnets" here on Amazon and make your own really cute magnets with some imagination, my daughter likes to use small plastic toys, marbles, etc. I've tried some pretty strong and heavy magnets on it and they tend to slide around quite a bit.The dry erase feature works pretty well, it cleans up nicely and quickly (the pen that comes with it has a little eraser built in).My only real problem with this board is that they only way you can hang it is to use the &#34;permanent&#34; self stick pads that come with it. The magnets that come with the board are strong enough to hold papers, postcards and photographs without sliding down. The included magnets are a nice idea, but they aren't strong enough to hold-up anything heavier than a sheet of paper or business card.All-in-all, I like this dry-erase board. The little accompanying magnets won't be able to hold much more than a sticky note or sheet of paper, but the board works with other stronger magnets and clip magnets. The magnets work ok but are not that strong so it slides down the fridge.I changed the back a little and mounted this on my sons door as an ever changing chore chart and how much each chore is worth.Overall there are better quality erase boards out there so just make sure this is the one you want before you buy it. The magnets are fun and they are strong enough to hold up a greeting card with one magnet. it comes with two magnets and a dry erase marker.There is really no edge and it is very plain, not a lot you can say about it. I really don't know why it wasn't packaged with magnets instead of adhesive pads. It's so lightweight that magnets would have worked very well.Overall, it's a nice board due to the size and sleek appearance. You can also expect to purchase new magnets for it and will also need to buy a new dry erase marker soon since this one doesn't last long.

It comes with two tiny circular magnets that don't have enough power to hold much beyond a single sheet of paper, and a black marker pen that (for me) was completely dried up.

When I attempted to fit it in with all of my assorted other magnets and notes, there was really no room and the thought of sticking it on with the enclosed adhesive stickers was strange.

The included magnets are adequate to hold 1-2 sheets of paper at best, more will just slide off, a better choice would be to add one of the modular cork boards for notes.Overall, these are a great solution for dorm rooms, children's rooms or kitchens; a little on the cheap side as far as construction is concerned, but functional.P-)
