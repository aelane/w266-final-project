It does not put the printer on each app's print menu. This is a great printer, I tested all aspects of it and it worked wonders.Keeping in mind that I'm using it for home and not at an actual work space, I liked the multifunction ability and how well it responded, copies are clear and scanner works fast. This printer is larger than most multifunction printers, but size does not necessarily indicate a plethora features. I mainly got this printer because I had that smaller Samsung SL-M2875 FW, which I like. This printer (the SL-M3370FD) does not have the wireless printing feature, which is a little disappointing &#8211; but that my is fault for not catching that when reading the description, so I did not take off any stars for that. All-in-all, I would recommend the printer if you are using it on a small wired home network (CAT5 cables) or a single computer with USB. As a printer this is a 5. The printer management tools for a device of this class are very robust. This printer is big and hefty.Duplex is only for printing; not scanning, copying or faxing. However, once the printer was connected to my office network I could see it from every computer on the network and install the software on all of the computers.First, the printer. I have been using a Brother printer that cost under 100 dollars for years. All that is moot for this printer because there is no networking, even from the router except for AirPrint and google cloud print.3. However, I just can't see spending so much for a printer that offers less than so many inexpensive printers which are available.

This is a very heavy printer and its big.

That's why this printer is so tall.This guy isn't going to fit well under a shelf, it needs a lot of space.Also, the scanner portion is really large as well.The whole thing is just big and bulky.Being so big, you'd think that the paper tray could hold more paper, but it's just the same size as other smaller laser printers.

The Samsung just shows up on your printer list in any iPhone or iPad app (assuming your network has wireless access).
