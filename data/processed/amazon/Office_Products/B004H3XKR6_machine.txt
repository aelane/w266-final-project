It's a nice looking machine right out of the box. With this machine you just replace the small yellow one.One thing else I noticed is that it does not have the annoying problem of turning itself on, and leaving the heads in the open position whenever there is a power failure. If it is important to you to have an all-in-one machine, I'd recommend this one.If you just want to print photos, look for something smaller and cheaper. This is a high-quality machine, with fast printing speeds, built in Wi-Fi, two paper trays, the ability to print two-sided documents, fax capabilities (no hand set, though), and an easy-to-read and operate touch screen. This is a big machine -- nearly 12" tall, 12.5" d even without the touch screen or paper tray extended, 17" wide. All in all, a very solid little machine at a superb price. The machine itself is great. An affordable machine that I can depend upon. However this machine has changed my mind. So over-all I could not be happier with this machine. My answering machine is set to pick up on the fourth ring so I set the Epson to pick up after the fifth. The machine includes an option for a header which was easy to set up. I'm shocked this machine hasn't yet become the standard and I'm surprised when I still see lesser quality machines on the market for sale. This is a large machine that can do everything. ***  You can load the machine with a whole ream of paper at one time and the two paper trays give you a lot flexibility. It's a large machine, but that is because it has all sorts of great features.
