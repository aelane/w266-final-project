There are two interior pockets that add some convenience. The two pockets are nice to have, and the rings are relatively easy to open, though less so than my other binder. (I'm not talking about the pockets on the *inside* of the front and back binder covers, which would potentially need to hold more. It has pockets on the inside and sleeves on the outside for title pages and a good sleeve on the center spine. The inside pockets are OK too. This has two inner pockets, and the larger version has four, so that's a point out of the favor of this binder. What I don't like is that the plastic pockets on mine are gapping on top on both the front and back, and bubbling up near the fasteners on the back, leaving them with a wavy, unprofessional look. There are also two pockets on the inside of the binder for miscellaneous notes, etc. The interior pockets are perfect for doing just that. *the inner pockets could be a little taller to keep your papers in a bit more securely*the price-wow! The pockets are made from the same plastic as the clear cover, which I don't care for. * The clear pockets (both inside and out) are thin and don't have much give, so they won't hold much. It has the typical inside pockets and outside 'slips' where you can insert pages of art or something to help define what the contents are.The internal rings seem to be good quality, although the bar that they are attached to seems small and is only attached to the white cover at two points.For CHILDREN I would say that this binder was a good choice. It has double pockets to hold papers, but not too many papers. The pockets are see through and sturdy.
