There are also black plastic handles to insert into the handle holes. The plastic handle on the one side will keep the box from tearing when you pick it up.I am storing items in them that are from around the house that need to be put away in a permanent place such as papers that need to be filed, magazines to be read, etc.The gray and white color is pleasing to the eye. I will be securing the plastic window on the 2nd box for more intermediate-storage of odds and ends... I like the plastic handle, my other bins have a cloth handle. I usually use clear plastic bins, but this seemed like a good alternate solution. The clear plastic window was a nice touch enabling you to see what is inside with a glance. These has plastic handles which seems to be not a match to snap on to the box but I honestly think you don't need it to grasp the box on its sides. The clear plastic in the side window is thicker and stronger than I expected, and a very good idea. Assembly was as easy as always, the plastic handles snap right into place. It's also nice to have the black plastic handles for the handle. The plastic handles are comfortable to use and a good idea.You can fit four of these under a twin bed, and eight under other beds if you manuver them just right. I'd get the plastic totes instead - cheaper, no assembly required, plus they're more water-resistant.I'd pay maybe $10 for two, but at the current price of $23 for two, definitely overpriced for what it is. This is a great alternative to the plastic and canvas bins available. I did find it possible to try to mate two of the four black plastic handle pieces in such a way that I was trying to mate two males whereas it should have been -- duh -- a male and a female, but then I realized all I had to do was examine any three of the four per box to sort it out.The inside dimensions of the size I have, which is the Small, are 6 inches in height, 15 inches in length and 12 inches in width. The plastic "window" is a nice touch. They include snap-on black plastic handles which gives this box a nice, finished look. I was expecting to receive plastic boxes; not cardboard. The black plastic handles were in a separate bag. The plastic handles add a level of comfort and structural reinforcement when moving the boxes around, at the cost of there forever being two substantial open holes to the box on either end -- not the end of the world insofar as you'll never be using these for archival or otherwise delicate purposes, but it does mean that anything stored inside may not come out as 'fresh' as it goes in.The cost per unit is comparable to the average plastic alternative, perhaps a hair on the high end of the same, but the aforementioned benefits it brings over the same are worth (in this reviewer's mind) the additional expense.

Generally I try to stick with stackable clear plastic bins with sealable lids.

I don't care for the plastic insert window as I wanted the boxes to store paperwork and I actually don't like seeing it through the clear plastic, so I just turn that side to the wall.

Mostly I use clear plastic tubs, but when I saw that the medium Bankers Box Stackable Storage Boxes sport a clear window to view contents, I thought they would make a good option for storing files and small items.The boxes arrived via UPS well packaged and unconstructed.
