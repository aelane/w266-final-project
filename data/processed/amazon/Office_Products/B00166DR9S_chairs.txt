You see, I've tried 4 different chairs from the Amazon site. Both chairs were crooked and although the padding was very comfortable,  I felt like my body was uneven  due to the weird angles that the chair had. Ultimately I had to return both chairs because it was very unprofessional looking in my office.Next, the Alera Fraze. I have both chairs on the lowest setting. Both chairs lack lumbar adjustment. By then chairs will be an anachronism of the first order because it's been rumored that we will be sitting on air. I used these chairs at work, a computer shop where we have technicians sitting on them all day for 10 hours a day.After about 2 years, the cushions deflated BARELY, and are STILL very comfortable to sit in.I liked it so much I decided to purchase one for myself in my college dorm room, everybody loves to steal it from me when I'm not in it!When it ships, and arrives, it requires absolutely NO tools, just snap-in and you're ready to relax! I have owned other chairs without using gravity force to recline. Some chairs fall back into a reclining position when you sit. The chairs that do this are the less expensive chairs sold on here. Not like other chairs where you have to put on the sides and screw the bolts in and then the back rest to the seat cushion and so on and so on.This chair is simply unfold and place seat cushion on to the base plate and slide in the 5 wheels your DONE.This chair is very comfortable, keeps you upright for good posture.
