They are an all around good pen. These write like a slightly pricier pen. I now use that pen at home and keep the purple one in my purse.The colored barrels are available with blue or black ink and I got another set for the office. Bic For Her Fashion is a thick pen, which I like. All in all I like it at about $3 per pen, it is cute and stands out from the crowd. It is thankfully a VERY light pen so that gives it it's most comfort.Ink:It writes surprisingly smoothly which is good since for years BIC (at least the basic versions) had (or has??) This pen is a hard worker. Each pen has a medium size (1.00m) point with matching ink, BIC's exclusive ink technology and an easy-glide system for smooth writing.An added bonus is my big burly macho husband will be less inclined to use them. I also like that they are retractable since pen caps have a tendency to get lost and therefore, dry out the pen. I'm always one to try out a new pen, and this BIC pen? By employing the pen, men can at once congratulate BIC on a good product DESPITE--not because of--its  steretypically feminine adornments. They're definitely a girly pen; I like them (and I'm in my 60's)! All in all... it's a pen. She who holds this pen will not crash through the glass ceiling. Otherwise a great pen!
