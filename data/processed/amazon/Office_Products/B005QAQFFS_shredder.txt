This is really an excellent shredder for my home needs. This is my first shredder so I don't have a lot to compare it to. This is an amazing shredder at a great price. My old shredder that I'd had for 5 years died and when I did my research for a new one I found that technology had changed a lot. I use this shredder daily and love knowing that any documents I shred are being cross-cut for my safety and protection. All in all this is an acceptable shredder. I just received the shredder and used it for the first time:Initial Impressions -  Excellent product... so far. This shredder has performed well so far but can only take a few sheets at a time. I love this shredder of  the last few I reviewed this is my favorite. I like this shredder because it just sounds powerful too. This shredder has no issues shredding through multiple pages or through credit cards. The shredder works great. I bought this to replace a shredder I had for over 15 years that couldn't shred more than 1 page at a time. The shredder is now in stock and sells for $59.99 making it a reasonable deal given my original review, the details of which follow:I would describe this shredder as a reasonably well built product that performs at or better than the claims made by its seller, Amazon. The shredder is a cross cut paper shredder, but because of the thickness and density of credit cards, they have a separate input slot and are only cut at a slant in one direction and need to be fed one at a time. We have had a Fellows shredder that is very similar in capacity but the trashcan is about 25% larger but the cutting mechanism that rests on top is somewhat lighter in spite of being larger. Overall, the Amazon Basic shredder has a feeling of quality due to the larger and heavier metal cutters inside. I am satisfied with this shredder and would recommend it, particulary since its price has been reduced further to $49.99 as of this update. This shredder gets pretty loud, but not overbearing. The shredder works great. This is a nice sized shredder for home use and holds a weeks worth of my shredded items under normal use. This is a very nice shredder of good quality.This shredder was a Vine program item so I cannot make a judgement as to its cost. The shredder is very useful and reliable. It's great to have a shredder that can really take 12 papers at a time without jamming. Now to the shredder: I wanted a pull out since my old shredder had a lift off. The shredder is not loud in my opinion. Overall this is a nice shredder for the price. I purchased this to replace a broken shredder. I have never owned a shredder, so I have nothing to compare this to; However, it has done an amazing job so far. I am very happy with this shredder, it is durable, strong, and built to last. I can now understand why this shredder is on the Amazon "#1 Best Sellers" list!!!! I am absolutely thrilled with this shredder! This shredder has a greater capacity for shredding multiple pages at one time, plus it shreds cards and CDs with ease. The shredder does as much as other shredders that cost twice as much. Let me start by saying I have always used a Fellowes shredder before. This shredder is the best it works great !!! Besides that, I really love my new shredder. This shredder is quick, handles lot of paper at once, keeps on going through a large stack of paper to shred without overheating (as my earlier shredder did), and is just a really nice shredder. This is now my shredder brand of choice! I grabbed this shredder after moving. I'd left behind a fantastic $500+ shredder. Overall, just a nice little shredder for the money. We bought this to replace an older shredder that gave out on us while started undergoing a massive shredding/cleaning out of our file cabinet. This shredder is fantastic!Unlike our previous shredder, it really does shred the 12 sheets at a time that it says it does, and this thing is fast! It's also relatively quiet; my last shredder (may it rest in peace after 12 years of loyal service) sounded like a freight train! This shredder is really a great buy. If you have the shredder in view it's no problem. This is about my fourth shredder, and it is the best I've had yet. I must confess that I burned my last shredder out. So this shredder comes along at the right time. Our old shredder was just not cutting it any more, and at a pitiful 5 sheets at a time (albeit 5 sheets would get stuck, the motor would overheat, etc). We are very happy with this shredder, as the blades are STILL sharp after all the abuse we put it through in the first few days. The shredder is less noisy than our old one, and credit cards and CDs really get destroyed well. This is a good shredder for the price and is probably better than the similarly priced and equivalent theFellowes Powershred W-11C 11 Sheet Cross-Cut Shredder (3103201)model because it can shred CDs/DVDs, while the Fellowes cannot.However, it's really VERY loud-it will definitely disturb office mates or house mates, even neighbors could hear it if your window is open. However if you want a lower-priced shredder and don't mind a few negatives, this AmazonBasics one will probably suit you just fine. This is a reasonable shredder for the price. This shredder powered through a whole day of shredding (not continuous since I let it cool down several times) but I could shred a whole bin full, empty it, and shred another whole bin full without having any issues of overheating.The cutters didn't jam but I did notice more pieces of paper being left in the cutters when the bin was full.This thing shreds paper like a champ, 20 receipts like nothing, 10 pages of thick pay stubs without struggling, and credit cards with a little effort.
