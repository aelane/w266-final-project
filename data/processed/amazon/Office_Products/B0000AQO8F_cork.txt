This is a really huge cork board. There's not much I can say about a cork board. No old-school cork, it actually reseals where you remove the pin.It's also made well. But we went ahead and got this for her and it's actually much nicer than I expected- the cork itself is much less VIVID than the ones you find in institutions (a duller brown, which makes the board look a lot higher end) and the moulding is much nicer than the cheap wood ones (but still not as nice as some I see on Pinterest, but again, haven't found time for that).There are a few problems with quality- I expect with regular use and constant re-arranging this won't stand the test of time. The cork feels thin, as if it's coated on rather than a solid layer of thick cork. A cork board is pretty straightforward, but what I like about this one is a thick backing and custom sturdy mounting hooks that hold it in place. Although I haven't used this long-term, I know previous cork boards I have used a thin layer of cork that starts coming off after extended uses. The cork seems to be high density but rather thin. The cork remains looking good after repeated pinning and unpinning. I use this cork board at work to post memos and reminders and as a quick reference for information that is used in the office daily. The cork board is of high quality "self-healing" material and looks great to boot. The cork board is a neutral, mid-range black/brown variety. I needed a cork bulletin board above my desk to clear my desk of clutter and keep a better eye on important notes, calendars, etc. The cork surface itself is not very thick, but the backing is a thin sheet of lurex (like those metallic balloons) so if you feel the need to push your pin in all the way to the hilt you can. This cork board is sufficiently heavy so you know it's well-made, it comes with the accessories you need to attach it to the wall, and its sturdy. It doesn't have a nasty cork odor, it looks professional, and once affixed to the wall it should stay forever. We bought this cork board to help me organize some things and it is surprisingly sturdy, comes with hardware and instructions for how to hang it. I especially like that the actual cork surface is not the typical shade of &#34;bright brown/orange&#34; but has more of a muted tone with black flecks. All in all, I really like this cork board and I think it would be perfect for a business or school, as well as a home office. Before this cork came along, one could not be blamed for thinking that there was some sort of law that required cork boards to be framed by thick pieces of wood. The cork is also thick enough to hold a standard push pin so items will stay in place! The cork itself is about average thickness.
