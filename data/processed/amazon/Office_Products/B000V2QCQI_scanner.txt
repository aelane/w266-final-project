Getting used to the scanner interface was fairly straightforward and very user friendly, even without referring to the manual. The Canon 8800F scanner replaced a scanner I've had for over eight years so the improvement in output resolution is amazing! This scanner works great - you won't be disappointed! I have had this scanner about 1 month now and I like it so far. This scanner performs in an amazing manner and can handle 35mm and 120 film and photos as well as 35mm slides. We bought the scanner for our old slides, and it works very well for that purpose. I had a Nikon Coolpix scanner and it produced fantastic scanned film images but at great expense and time. I bought this scanner for speed. My old scanner took about 20-30 seconds (including placing it and removing it) at 300 dpi for a 4x6 photo.I figured all the Canon scanners would scan photos with good quality, but with a lot of photos to scan, time was the issue. And the scanner is so fast, it is almost like using a real copier. I have had this scanner for about a month. I had been using an HP scanner for years and found that when I purchased a new desktop with Windows 7 that it was incompatible with my new system. I read about this scanner on a professional designer's forum. I am running this scanner under Windows Vista. The scanner does not require a warm up, so scans are very rapid. I got this scanner primarily for its ability to scan 35mm negatives, and since the 8800F has been superseded by Canon's 9000F, it was available at a reduced price. Since this scanner has been on the market for a while, that could be why it is being sold with old software. This is the first scanner we have owned and I don't know anything about any others, but this one works fine for us and was easy for my husband to use (after our son showed him how).
