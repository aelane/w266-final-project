They make great pockets to put things like tickets or journaling items in that you want to be able to remove from a pocket and see at the same thing. Once you place the poly pockets on a notebook or folder, they are not going anywhere. I thought these pockets were for use on a wall but when I read farther, I noted the "permanent" adhesive" statement. The pockets are made of a heavy gauge clear poly material. The pockets can be peeled off any smooth hard surface they are on (except for soft & porous surfaces like paper and stucco wall) without leaving any adhesive residue. These pockets are ideal to store temporarily small notes up to 5" X 7", envelopes up to the legal size, or store receipts before filing. These pockets are very handy and useful, although I wasn't able to use them as I had originally intended. You can actually fit 2 or 3 more in, but I have to believe that can lead to damaging the pockets. I use the pockets inside my file folders to hold small items and papers that I would normally just place in the folder -- and eventually lose! It's great that I can slap these on where the pockets are lacking!Again, these are incredibly useful for so many things- I'm happy to have a few on hand to use when I come up with a new idea for them! What I really wanted these pockets for was in my art journal, and they're a little pricey but still worth it to give a "grab bag" feel to an art journal page. I personally chose to use these to add pockets to the outside of a plastic storage bin for make things easier when labeling and re-labeling things, but the uses for this are virtually unlimited. These handy pockets have helped create a bit of order where it didn't exist before:1. Seriously, these pockets are an answer I hadn't considered to save a lot of time that I formerly spent searching for important scraps of paper. I use the other pockets that are business card size all the time and they work like a charm, so I thought these ones might be even better. These easy to use poly pockets create additional space within binders, notebooks, scrapbooks, folders, etc. These pockets came in handy to throw the receipts into while we stored the other medical papers in the three-hole section of the binder. I used these handy pockets by pasting them inside three ring binders that I use for travel. These clear pockets are great for ongoing art projects. drawing) he is currently working on into one of these pockets inside the front cover of a notebook. I have already found two of these pockets useful to organize our bathroom cabinets, to hold a paper list of what is inside each cabinet - which are deep and dark, so we don't buy duplicates of things we already have. These pockets are very handy. We will use these for adding pockets to folders and binders for the kids to use for school.I also hoped to use them in a travel journal by turning them so the opening would be in the seam of the journal.

You can find similar pockets on Amazon from other manufacturers, only many of these are close to twice the price of the Smeads.-- The pockets adhere clearly - if positioned on another clear, they are practically invisible!-- No bubbling of the clear backing, at least on smooth surfaces - this was something that worried me, but I don't see it in the binder or on the clear storage box.The not-so-good:-- The removable backing adhering to the sticky surface is a little fiddly.

The convenient pockets could be used practically anywhere.
