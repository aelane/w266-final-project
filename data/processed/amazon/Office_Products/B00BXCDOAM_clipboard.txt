Nice to know that if I ever need a clipboard, I have one handy. It's handy to use as a clipboard, should the need arise.The catch for me is that I don't often need a document lift, and this is much bulkier than my slim metal lift so storage is a problem. I use a clipboard constantly. I like looking at an angled clipboard but I had never bought one before.Having reviewed in March 2013 a Fellowes PlushTouch Mouse Pad/Wrist Rest, I figured another product would fit on my same desktop. And as a clipboard, well, it's pretty cool as the clip is adjustable (and removable) and it certainly contrasts looks with other clipboards. This clipboard and stand has more features than I first realized when I opened the box. First, it's a clipboard that can be used with or without the stand. Truthfully, a clipboard works the same way, but the Document Lift happened to be the closest thing I could find. Who would have guessed that I'd still be having fun using a clipboard on a stand after all these years?Oh, and you CAN use it to hold papers that you want to look at while typing as well, but what is the fun in that?Note: Thanks to my wife for her insights in writing this review.

The clipboard fits securely into the stand and can be placed next to your computer.The document holder is also a dry erase board, but a marker is not included.

I carry a clipboard at work, and typically have a dozen or so sheets with orders, reminders, invoices and notices clipped on it.

The Document Lift can also function as a clipboard.
