Nonetheless, the product is sufficient for closing and firmly securing belongings in the shipping boxes. Great product! Great product. Great product! Scotch Sure Start Shipping Packaging Tape is a no hassle product that gets the job done. when it comes to accurate product descriptions or labels.My definition of "Sure Start" means that the tape never sticks to its guide and or never falls-out of the guide and sticks to itself again and you spend 5 minutes spinning the clear tape round and round and wishing you had finger nails to get the tape started again. First of all, I am not sure what is "new" about this product, but since it was in the Amazon Vine program, I tried it. An excellent product at a good price. And with this product, Scotch does deliver. This product is "Made In The USA" and says so right on its label. I find this product to be of high quality and one of the easiest to use.It is also very quiet when using it. This is a good product - durable tape, in an easy to use dispenser (38 yards). Overall a good product that does what it says.

This product holds up well and meets the shipping specs of FedEx, UPS and the USPS.

The Scotch product is clearly inferior.

This product seems so much better than dollar store tape.
