We tried a few different pencils and they were ground down to more than half their full, new, starting size and still, no indicator of sharpness other than taking the pencil out and visually examining it. Other than that, we had pencils that are considered standard and fit in our old manual sharpener without issue, but they were not accepted by the iPoint. The pencils come to a nice point without grinding down too much of the pencil.This has a nice bin to hold the shavings. This is for no 2 pencils only. We'd been buying those disposable mechanical pencils that never feel quite right simply because it's seemed to be such an impossible pursuit to find a pencil sharpener that actually works to sharpen pencils and not eat them. As we nearly never have larger-than-standard pencils, I do not need an adjustable hold size. 2 sized pencils will fit in the sharpener.- Shavings reservoir is a little smaller than I'd prefer.- Was a bit louder than I expected.- May not always sharpen pencils evenly.- Made in China.The "Westcott iPoint Curve Axis Electric Heavy Duty Pencil Sharpener" is an effective desktop sharpener that does the job well enough for just about any user. I sharpened 24 pencils in a row and did not run into any issues. They go through a LOT of pencils. When I sharpen pencils, I have to hold the pencil sharpener or else it starts sliding backwards.Other than those little quirks, this is a nice pencil sharpener and I'm happy to have it. How many pencils do you really expect to sharpen at once?

It wouldn't hurt if the pencils came out a little more centered with the point.
