This ink cartridge arrived promptly; was dated within expiration date; and , as original replacement, worked well in my printer. If you buy a regular HP ink cartridge you are buying what I call a sample HP INK cartridge since it runs out of ink quickly. You then have to ask, "how much ink do they really put in the regular OVER priced HP INK cartridges"? This black ink prints a good, crisp black that is clear and easy to read, while also providing very nice greyscale tones too. Ink is ink...Recommended The ink I received was a genuine HP-branded product, and worked as expected. I buy my ink from here twice and I believe its a good deal since I don't have to pay tax and if I buy it at other stores they charge me either $2-$5 more and plus tax therefore buying through amazon is a Great Deal. Genuine HP ink.

They deliver more ink that keeps them going well with each and every time I have to print up a project on paper.

The ink produces great picture in my HP brand printer, but I constantly feel the urge to go with a cheaper option.

This is good ink and i like that it has both colors together in the one pack.
