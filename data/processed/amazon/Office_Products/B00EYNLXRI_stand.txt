I'm very enthusiastic about this stand. The stand is adjustable and STAYS in place. It isn't set up to do this, but for me, it worked really well.There is also a Rolodex Mesh stand for laptops--that looks equally well designed and, of course, more suited for the computer. When I got it, I thought it would be a good stand for my tablet, but my tablet is a 10 inch and I guess the pictures I was shown where it was holding a tablet may have been a 7 inch? This stand is sturdy and the metal material is high quality. This stand fits both with no problem. This is a terrific little stand. Since this stand is made of metal, it's not going to be as easily damaged as plastic stands, and it provides a nice stable surface for your device to rest against. This stand is just the right fit for me. I would definitely recommend this stand to anyone with a tablet or smartphone and I'm considering purchasing a couple for Christmas gifts. The stand is sturdy and I believe will stand up to significant use. If you need a stand for any type of device, you may want to give this a try.

It should be noted that I used the stand with an Ipad mini with a fairly low profile case.

This stand adjusts to various viewing angles and provides easy access to the on button and the charging port.

I use this stand for my newly acquired Dell 7&#34; tablet.
