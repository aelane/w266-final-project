This sharpener lasted about as long as all of the other sharpeners I've had in my classroom do. I got this sharpener thinking that it would fit well on my computer desk, however, it is HUGE and takes up a lot of space. That being said, this would be a great sharpener for a classroom, which is one of its selling points. This is to be expected since it is an electric sharpener. I own another Bostich sharpener which I really liked but this has some advantages in my studio that the other didn't.First I should point out that it's larger so if you have a tiny amount of room, you may wish to opt for one of the other more traditional sharpeners. I ordered this sharpener for my classroom based on the positive reviews it received. I would not buy this sharpener again nor would I recommend it to anyone. This is the best sharpener I have every used and enjoys a place of honor on my desk! This is a very nice sharpener. And I was especially impressed by the different sizes that this sharpener can accommodate.Digging deeper, I remember messing around with the electric sharpeners in school, doing dumb, dangerous things that dumb, dangerous boys do. All in all, it is a nice, big sharpener that can sharpen any kind of pencil. I haven't found one good electric sharpener yet. I hope it has a longer life-span than my previous electric sharpener and will update after a couple of months of use.

This sharpener is oustanding!!!

They don't really anchor the sharpener, but the do keep it from running away while you're sharpening.

It is a pretty deep sharpener, so once pencils get short, they can't be put in this sharpener anymore.
