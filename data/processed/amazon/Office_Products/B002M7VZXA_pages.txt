No, but if you are constantly bookmarking pages, then its certainly worth a purchase. They can be used to mark pages, or you can divide up a book or other media that doesn't have the ability to add normal dividers.I've used post it notes in the past, but these are preferable because the sticky part is clear, allowing you to see the text under the tab. She is using them to mark specific pages in her accounting book, and everyone in her class wanted them too, including the professor. Rigid enough to stay parallel with your pages; no limping or bending problems.3. I am using them to mark the pages in all my cookbooks that have recipes that I make occasionally.I am using the magenta colored tabs on all dessert recipes and the blue one for everything else. Not only do they peel off of thin pages easily and without much worry about ripping the page, but the adhesive is just soft enough not to copy ink onto the adhesive section itself. These Avery NoteTabs are great for marking pages in books.

Tab pages in books that are inspirational or that you like to refer back to or recipes that you want to try. They are great if you often reference certain pages but don't want to permanently alter or damage the book. With these it is much easier to turn the pages, you don't have to worry about the pages ripping because these are smaller. The pages turn much easier with these than the larger size.Writing on the tab is not a problem. They are nice and sturdy, so they are easy to grab on to and turn pages and don't tear.

They are super easy to stick on and don't tear the pages when removed.I use these a lot in recipe books and to mark pages in books that I need to reference. They are very tough and durable and will hold up even to turn pages. They are stiff enough to use to turn pages, but can be written on, not just on the tab but also on the part that sticks to the page. I also use them when I am reading and want to mark pages and include a note. First I used a few to mark some pages of a large phone book I'm frequently turning to. I was able to stick one onto a few different pages without it losing its stickiness.
