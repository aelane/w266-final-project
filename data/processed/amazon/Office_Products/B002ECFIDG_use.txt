Executive Summary - It's hard to find a use for these that other things don't do better. (Perhaps they would find a more common use in the office, where one might want to temporarily label a file until the final file name could be determined? The first use I put them to was to label some CDs I have containing documents and such, and they did what I needed them to do perfectly. Though they're somewhat limited in their use because of this, depending on what you need them for, they can prove quite handy. Avery's Removable Label Pad has replaced my use of sticky notes. The best use I would think for these labels is on absorbent (not "slick") & flexible paper such as in a planner, book page, document, but not on a file folder, box, or glass item.On the positive side, the colors of the labels are really nice and bright. And the use of the resealable bag prevents the potential wasted labels. I would like to see more use of recycled paper and eco-friendly ink in the future. Often the use of an adhesive remover is necessary, and either way I'm left with a gooey mess of label remnants and time wasted on a pretty pointless chore. One use is to label your luggage so you can spot your bag from distance in baggage terminal. Other use is to label jars in kitchen. They would be great for use with scrapbooking (perhaps permanent glue should be added), name tags, bookmarks, reference notes, and so much more. )Another use is to label CDs that I'm using for backup -- I do this when I can't find my Sharpie marker, which is maybe half the time.
