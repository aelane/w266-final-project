The pockets, however, don't expand much and don't really hold much. These pockets are very useful. These pockets are sturdy, attractive, hold well to smooth surfaces, and can be repositioned at least a few times without losing their adhesion. These are great pockets for papers. Unlike similar pockets that use magnets, this obviously sticks on non-metal surfaces.Just like a normal post-it, the more you move the pockets, the less likely it will stick again. I left the pockets on for an hour the first time before moving, then for 2 days before moving again. I love these pockets. That's great for securing the pockets, but I wouldn't stick these on a wall, because removing them later may destroy the paint.The product packaging promises 'simple organization,' and I think these sticky filing pockets are just brilliant. The pockets are quite sturdy, and the attach to surfaces quite well, but I do not like how flat they are. What I really liked was how easy it was to post these pockets anywhere - on the painted walls, on wood and on metal. These pockets are good for holding a few items and are helping me keep the kitchen counter just a little cleaner... while not cluttering up the refrigerator much more. The pockets are sturdy feeling with two long adhesive strips down each side, meant to run vertically. Similarly, I could see using one of the smaller pockets on a large square food container I'm always filling with pancake mix, so as not to mix it up with the flour, etc., and also to hold a few recipes for using that mix. These cute little pockets have made my forgetful life a lot more organized, and they can be removed in an instant when I have company coming over and replaced when the company heads home again!I give this product five stars simply because it does everything it's supposed to do, perfectly. The two small pockets hold hold #10 envelopes perfectly. They're reasonably attractive... for plastic pockets stuck to a wall. The pockets are removable and restickable so if you don't like where you initially stuck them, they can be moved.My biggest problem with the pockets was that the sizes (an 8.5x11 size, an envelope size and a receipt size) were often not actually big enough to hold multiple envelopes or receipts and if you stuffed the 8.5x11 one too full the papers flopped all over the place. I was initially skeptical when I came across these post-it pockets, but was pleasantly surprised by how well they held up. I really like these pockets because they allow me to stash some frequently used items that I don't want to file away (and forget about) or lose (accidentally shred!) The Post-It Pockets Organizational Set of Three pockets are made of nice, strong material and the adhesive is superb but the flawed design makes for limited use - simply put, you can't "put" much in these pockets. The pockets get full quickly and would have been much more useful if the sides of the pockets would have had two or three accordian foldings for a little bit of expansion.I love 3M and Post-It products but these pockets aren't a favorite... I have the small and medium pockets on my fridge for coupons. And these organizational pockets are of no use to me if they can't hold at least a few days' mail: what's the use of putting just one day's mail in them and then having to further deal with that one day's mail on the same day? The pockets aren't gusseted & won't hold much. These pockets will stick to my desk hutch and I'm able to move them without pulling off the paper-like top layer that covers the particle board. I'm impressed, overall, with these pockets and have come to find them quite useful to keep things handy, within reach, and off my limited desk top space. The smaller pockets are particularly wonderful for coupons and business cards. The two smaller pockets though, don't seem to hold as much as the picture on the packet indicates. I use my smaller pockets for some other things I need to collect - some papers that are about 2x4 inches and a sandwich bag that holds small Box Tops for Education. These three pockets don't accommodate everything I need, but they do effectively help with some of my annoying kitchen clutter.

So when I saw Post-It pockets, I felt that I finally had something to save me from myself.

SO now I could put them in these pockets, have them handy, and free myself from clutter.

So I finally broke down and used these pockets for a big project with a lot of fiddly little papers to keep track of.
