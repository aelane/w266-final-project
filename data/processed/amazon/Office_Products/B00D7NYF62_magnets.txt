Thankfully, this did come with some magnets for the back so that I could put it on my fridge, but they're so lightweight and don't really grip well, so I've seen the board slowly sliding downward. It comes with two magnets, which are convenient. You had to attach the magnets to the back but then it stuck very well on the fridge. It comes with two magnets for that purpose.It comes with a marker which has a whiteboard eraser on the cap, and two magnetic holders. You can permanently stick it to wherever, or use the included magnets, stick them to the double stick tape, and attach it to something metallic.Mine came straight and flat and works great. The magnets are not overly strong but I prefer it this way since the board is always moving from surface to surface as notes are left in places so they will not be missed.Can't say enough good things about this product. It was easy to mount the magnets on the back and put up. It comes with two magnets, mounting strips and a dry-erase pen. The magnets hold it nicely to the door and the pen that was included works well for making a list. I thought I'd be able to use the magnets and then later place it somewhere else using the sticky pads, but you end up using both of them at once. It has some magnets for the back of the board so you can put it on the fridge or a magnetic board. I need to go and find some magnets to mount on our wall, so that this board can be mounted. We've attached the mounting magnets on it so we can use it both as a drawing board and as a reminder board for the kids. they include 2 magnets with it, plus a marker.the magnet on the marker, however, does NOT stay attached to the board, and i find the pen lying on the floor.over all, this is a very useful board. Once the magnets are attached, they are solidly on there--and the magnets are very strong, so I have no worries about the board sliding down or falling off my fridge.The surface of the board is flat and even, as you'd expect. The magnets are very strong, the board stays put nicely on my fridge. It also comes with two magnets to hang little notes on the board. The magnets are easy to stick on and they are strong. The magnets work great and hold the board up well. We used some with the typical ceramic magnets and the surface scratched. The magnets which came wi the this have a thin layer of plastic tape on them...

The magnets are well strong enough to keep it in place if you aren't in the practice of hanging on it when you write.

It comes with 2 magnets and they are strong enough to keep thicker papers on the board.

To use the magnets you are basically sticking them to the sticky pads that you stick to the board.
