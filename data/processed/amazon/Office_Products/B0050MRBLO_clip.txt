I found the clip on this product to be difficult to use. But it is indeed a "Swing clip." Finally, just swing the clip back in toward the report cover until it's back in place with the paper securely held in between the plastic flap and the back cover. There is a swing clip which isn't complicated but if you're not into mechanics, you may have to fumble with it for a little bit. It's only easy once you figure out how the clip works. The "swing clip" holds the pages securely in place, but is easy to release. The clip rotates on a brad, rather than being pushed directly on, or being opened and closed. The clip has an extra piece of plastic that covers the sheets so they are not wrinkled by the clip.Overall, very useful, especially for the price. So, I messed with it trying to figure out how to lift the clip, when I finally realized it just swings open. Also, the clip takes up about and inch margin, so that should be considered in printing. I honestly could not open up the clip inside to put any paper in. The clip is simple and easy to use. there is a clip on top that allows you to hold up to 30 pages just swing the clip place your pages down and slide the clip over the pages and your are all set.
