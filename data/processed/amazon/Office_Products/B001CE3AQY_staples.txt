It says to use S.F4 staples but I have a generic staple that works just fine in it. 4 staples. 4 staples that I found in my husband&#8217;s study and tossed the ancient staples.So far, this stapler is a smooth performer with no jamming. 4 Premium staples for best results. Best of all it uses standard staples and holds an entire 210 staple stripe. It does just fine with normal staples. I don't have any Swingline staples, so I tested it with Bostitch staples.Compared to the Swingline 747 (heavier, all metal) and the Swingline 545 (much lighter, almost all plastic), the LightTouch is plastic on top, steel covered with plastic below, and does indeed require significantly less effort to staple the same thickness of paper. I was also disappointed that it didn't come with any staples, but fortunately, I had the correct SF4 staples already on hand.My daughter really likes this stapler as it takes very little pressure for the stapler to work properly for her. it is very lightweight and very easy to load staples. The staples also come out straight. 4 Premium Chisel Point Staples, 0.25 Inch Leg Length, 1 Box, 5,000 Staples per Box, Silver (S7035450)staples. So I ordered these staples and it hasn't jammed since. The Bostitch staples were a bit neater through 20-sheets, but they all worked just fine.The only disappointment for me is that it doesn't allow for tack stapling... opening the stapler up and tacking something against a wall or corkboard. It takes standard-size staples and can easily hold together large sheafs of paper.

Naturally, the regular Swingline staples also fit the product, so there was no need to run out for a different size "ammunition.

I do wish they had included some staples with it, I used some I had laying around, which I noticed jammed after a few staples.

It should work well with any standard staples, but I will try the ones they recommend to see if that helps with the jamming.
