If you are using this to pack boxes for moving, or using it for a business, you will find this to be a very strong and reliable packing tape. I would trust this with heavy boxes. It would also work great for packing boxes to move. It sticks very well too; I never worry about my boxes coming untaped.Another place where this tape shines is in the workshop. I build small boxes with miter joints sometimes, and I use this tape to hold the box together while the glue dries. It is particularly good for taping boxes for mailing. Worked well for moving boxes. I do ship prepare boxes pretty often as well.

I packed large boxes full of my heavy cookware, books, DVDs & much more- not one box even dented, let alone fell apart on me.

We used it to package boxes for storage in an unheated space, and have had no complaints with its performance.~A_E~

We are able to use less and still fell comfortable the boxes are sealed securely.
