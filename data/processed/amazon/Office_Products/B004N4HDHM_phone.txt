I purchased this phone to replace my 7+ year old AT&T; 3-handset phone system. You can use the other phone or the speakerphone on the base to make a call. We can finally find a phone when we need it. It helps us know what phone is missing. We are really enjoying this phone. I can see it if you are expecting important phone calls and have to go out for a bit, but that is just a rare thing in this house so we have never used that feature. Just received this phone a few days ago and am very well satisfied. This is a great phone for the money and talked my family into ordering one also. This phone system works well. This phone sounds very good. Until we found this phone. Adding phone numbers to the memory is quite easy; redial, calls missed, speaker phone, volume, and caller id are perfect. It is as good a phone as you can use. This phone is not perfect, but it is the best available at present. This phone is very versatile. Every phone feature imaginable is included..4. I must say that this phone is excellent and worth the cost as it is clear and so easy to set up.Has not given me any problems since I bought it and I just like the many features it has. It also means the phone can get at a good angle against the ear since there's not a flat surface that forces it into a certain position on the shoulder.I like the black front surface as well, looks a lot better than some of the ones that have a really garish color scheme. The phone book is huge and will down load automatically from your cell phone. I bought these to replace my Dect 6.0 Panasonic Cordless phone set with 4 handsets of which all 4 the headset jacks failed over less then 1 year. This is a great phone system if you still need an answering machine and want multiple handsets throughout the house. I bought this phone set to replace a 20+ year old roam phone set that lacked handset speaker phone capability and batteries that wouldn't hold a charge. Cell phone pick up, answering machine, call blocking, etc...so many benefits. I purchased this phone to replace an aging Panasonic Panasonic KX-TG5110. This phone has great sound quality and many features that less expensive phones do not have. I use the phone a lot to make outgoing calls. I bought this phone system to replace my six year old uniden 5.8GHz system, which I had nine handsets in use. Basically removing one phone, and adding another. I was really excited after using this phone the first night. When this happens, I pick up the phone and can hear the other person but they can't hear me. The phone directory is pretty basic too. This is a phone. This 5-handset Panasonic phone set replaces our (many years-old) Panasonic 4-handset system. I do not think it is the phone however..it may be my own cell phone which is cracked and is doing things that I do not ask it to do, while not doing things that I want it to do. When I purchase my new phone (it will take a while since I am unable to upgrade at this time), I will try the Bluetooth again. I  have insured this phone for two years, so I am covered either way. This phone does everything it says it will, and does it well. I wish this phone had a better user interface and call blocking features. Overall I like this phone and I would buy this product again. When I am on the phone and another call is coming through i get the audible chime that I have another call but the Caller ID on the phone or the base tells me nothing. Great phone with good call quality. well I needed a phone system for my home that had 5 stations we had purchased a Panasonic system 8 years ago and were very happy with the quality , so we researched the item and found it on amazon . the phone system is great its speaks to you and lets you know who is calling , has intercom system and receiver locator.T
