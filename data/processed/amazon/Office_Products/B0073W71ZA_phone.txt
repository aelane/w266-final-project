This phone is clear and I have no issues with people saying there is a bad connection or cant hear me. The phone is simple but has a ton of advanced features if you need them. First and foremost as a phone, it does a great job. Overall, this phone is easy to install and requires 7 hours of charging (according to the manual). It performs the basic phone features well, such as a clear speakerphone and decent answering machine. This is particularly helpful when you are charging your phone and need to make a call. One phone is place in living room and the second in the bonus room.The phones have a good, clear sound and very nice range. When this phone became available through the Vine program I jumped at the chance to get it. If you are used to using an older phone as I had this one may be too complicated for some even with the manual. This phone will show me on the handset if I have a voice mail message through Verizon (rather than having to pick up the phone to see if I get a tone as in the past). You can also manually add phone numbers to the memory. We've been using this phone for the last couple of months and it is proving to be the best set of Panasonic phones we've used.Before getting into this, I will say that we still use our home phone extensively - unlike a lot of people who are starting to use their cell phones more & more. This phone sounds just great, looks good, feels like real quality and it has so many features, not to mention 5 receivers, that I don't see how you best this deal ($120)! I just set my phone next to the handset and start taking calls on the land line. Speaker phone mode is impossible to use as the call cuts in and out. I even managed to successfully transfer my phone list from my cell phone via Bluetooth. My Ooma phone service has voice mail which emails recordings of my messages to me and texts transcripts to me. I recommend this phone system. I wouldn't even know where to begin raving about this phone. This phone has the capability to add 3050! As far as the phone itself is concerned, the sound is crystal clear, the display easy to read, the menu almost self-explanatory. I highly recommend this phone. This even when you only have a few phone numbers in the phonebook. I would really recommend this phone. I bought this phone for my mother to replace the worn down one I bought before. I am not sure if I like that or not, as well as this phone not having the rubber piece on the back, which helps it stay steady on a table, etc. I also bought this phone because of the keypad on the base. If you cannot find a phone, you can still answer or dial out. It seems to be a good phone for the price and I may buy one later without the cell hookup. Easy to operate.I like how I can call my other phone as an intercom too... Very nice phone system. Unfortunately, the phone numbers for my town and most of the surrounding towns start with 6. It was a panasonic and I don't blame the phone. I upgraded to a 3 phone package so my wife and I don't have to hand off to each other all the time.Panasonic has made some improvements over the years. This phone is capable of linking with your cell phone so that when you are home, calls to your cell phone will ring in on the home phone.

It may be that a certified phone would work better with the manual copy function.

The Panasonic phone allows up to 3,050  phone numbers in the phone book, so you can store quite a number of people.

The phone book is shared between all of the handsets connected to the phone set and are easily accessed and used.As I mentioned earlier, I use this phone with myOoma Telo Free Home Phone Service, and it works very well with it.
