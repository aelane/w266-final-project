This is the label maker for you! It is a cool label maker, but it's not without its flaws. Until now I have been using a Brother P-Touch label maker. Just take the label maker out of the box, open the back, insert the battery and label cartridge and you are done. This label maker is expensive, but you get what you pay for. I should at least be able to print on 3/4 of the label width.Other than that this is a pretty good label maker and I like the fact that it has a great touch screen interface which isn't exactly the greatest but it works well. I let it charge, but have never been able to use the label maker without having it plugged in. The label tape has gotten jammed a couple of times and I've had to open the unit to reposition the tape. This has never happened on any of the other label makers I own. You cannot just turn it on and print a label; you always have to wait for the start-up process to finish. The LabelManager LM 500TS is the most versatile and capable label maker I've ever used. I never knew how handy a label maker could be until I got one. This is one of the best stand-alone label printers money can by. This is a label maker with quite some bells and whistles, not sure an average user will take advantage all the included special features.First of all, it's huge...I mean "HUGE" for a label maker. However the label maker won't charge the battery while it is connected to the PC via the USB cord. Overall, this is a great label maker that prints nice looking labels very easily. However, it is impossible not to notice it is the most expensive label maker in its class. This Dymo label maker represents a great step up. My Brother label maker uses normal AA batteries or DC power from a wall-wart. I've never owned a label maker before so don't have a different brand to compare this to, but, like the previous reviewer, I will say that I was surprised at how large it was when I first took it out of the box. Easy to design your label, there are a few different fonts to choose from, a few different sizes, and lots and lots of different symbols (the only one I couldn't find was the & symbol).The label prints very fast, within a couple seconds for a short one, I was able to print 15 small ones in under a minute.If you're looking for a good label maker and price isn't really a concern, I would say you cannot go wrong with this one, its colorful, easy to navigate, and prints fast, and the tape is reasonably priced, so why not?God Bless ~Amy The biggest label maker I've seen or used. I've purchased three label makers over the last 2 years. Inserting the label cassette was just as challenging, it only fits one way but Dymo does a terrible job illustrating how it goes. You can't restart the label printer from your computer.Other observations:  For a $200 label maker I was surprised the computer software disk was not enclosed, it has to be downloaded online. You can store a few label designs from the program on the labeler. You can save your label formats in its memory for repeat use. I had an old Dymo label making that was dying so I was looking forward to this one as a replacement. The label weren't bad but it could have been made easier with some colored marking that instantly show how to put the labels it. It can save a label internally or on your computer, which is handy.You have to get the computer software by going to Dymo.com, to download it, but this is not hard. This label maker has a lot going for it. I have a few label makers and this is my favorite.It's really easy to set up and use. It cuts off the label when it's done printing for a very neat finish. If you use a label maker every day, again this machine would be worthwhile. This is a very nice label maker. The DYMO LabelManager 500TS Label Maker is just that a... label maker, but with a twist. As a label maker, the 500TS is good at what it does, which is to be expected in this day and age... it prints labels well.But, the DYMO 500TS is much more than just a plain, old label maker... it can be connected to you computer (PC or Mac) so that you can make better labels with custom fonts and graphics that can be stored on the label maker.
