I'm almost positive this is my printer because I have had this issue with mailing seals as well, but just wanted to advise others to check this before printing many labels. I needn't have worried, my printer took up each sheet with no difficulty and no jamming and printed out beautiful address labels.I'm very happy with the quality here. Just got a new printer - the old one had trouble pulling through labels etc to keep on the lines. These have never jammed my printer, are easy to peal off, and are strong enough to adhere to an envelope without worries. But my epson printer grabs them with a slight shift each time.In all other aspects, these are excellent ink jet labels. They go through the printer smoothly. We use a Brother 640CW printer and the labelers work very well. She didn't try sending them through the printer multiple times, so don't know how well that would've worked They work perfectly in my HP printer. They print cleanly and smoothly without jamming in the printer.

Laser printer results are excellent as well.I usually do need to print a huge number of labels and can't fill the entire sheet.

But unless you are going to have a printer that serves only as a label printer, if you have only one or two labels to print, you will save time by writing them by hand because there is some setup time.

(I was afraid they would get stuck inside the printer - didn't happen).
