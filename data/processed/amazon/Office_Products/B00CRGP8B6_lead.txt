And the lead is only 2 3/8" long. The lead is sturdy and thus worked well without frequent breaking. The lead gives a strong yet smooth graphite line. The lead is a little bigger and so there are less breaks. It is hard and dry, doesn't clear the written lead well, and leaves a trail of color as you use it. The lead is #2, and they're made of heavy duty plastic so they don't feel flimsy and they aren't going to break easily. They are refillable as far as the lead goes, but sadly the erasers are not. These are truly amazing lead pencils. I tested the lead and actually got some words where the print actually looked black. The 1.3mm lead is thick, sturdy and provides a pronounced, dark mark ... perfect for standardized test requirements. The lead is 1.3mm, which is THICK. The lead doesn't break as easily as the stuff in "regular" mechanical pencils. The lead advance system on this pencil is easy to use and quite smooth. it does not break as easily as other lead and the erasers don't tear the paper when erasing.This is a great pencil for the price and your mechanical pencil lover will enjoy these! I am accustomed to snapping off leads regularly on the traditional thin lead mechanical pencils, and I could not get one of these to break !1a) Great for kids (or anyone) who bears down hard on their pencils2. The thick lead allows you to keep rotating the pencil to maintain a sharp edge at the end of the lead2. The lead flows easily onto the page without having to apply much pressure8. The fat lead makes filling in the bubbles on standardized tests fasterCons:1. The thick lead doesn't work well with the tiny boxes in crossword puzzles in the newspaper2. I have not deliberately tried to break the lead, but it feels quite sturdy. They have a good strong lead that feels right, looks great, NEVER EVER BREAKS, never needs sharpened, lasts practically forever, and erases easily when needed! The lead clicks out in perfect increments, the pencils feel so comfortable in my hand while writing, and they even have flat sides so they don't roll off the table! I will never go back to the flimsy lead type again. The lead is thick and it makes that cut off top even more prominent because of it. It appears more to blend the lead into the paper than actually erase it. This could be because the lead is so much thicker and more lead is actually deposited onto the paper. The lead in them is pretty thick as well and I think these would be good for students or test taking, but not so great for drawing. This Paper Mate with provided lead is more like writing with a #2 wooden pencil and it just feels great. The lead is the best part of the Paper Mate Mates pencils.The eraser is nice too though. The lead is really thick. The lead is advanced by pushing on the eraser, leads inserted by pulling out the eraser. The 1.3mm lead is a bit thicker than I care for, leaning more toward the .5 or .7 ordinarily, but for taking notes, scrawling grocery lists and that sort of writing, it is fine. The lead, of course advances when you push down briskly on the eraser, but it requires enough force that it doesn't advance the lead when you don't want it to happen. The 1.3mm lead is much sturdier than thinner ones. I have always favored .07 mm lead, but become aggravated because the lead is easily broken. The lead is not the thin size that snaps off every time it comes in contact with paper. I usually write with a 9mm lead to avoid breakage, and this 1.3mm seemed like it would be sturdy. Plus, they write well and the thick 1.3 mm lead does not break easily. The lead is refillable by removing the eraser and slipping in a new one into the chamber.The only thing I do not like about this pencil is that the base of the eraser has the same triangular shape as the pencil. I also like that the lead is thick enough not to break as easily as thinner leads. But for me personally, the lead is not soft enough.I
