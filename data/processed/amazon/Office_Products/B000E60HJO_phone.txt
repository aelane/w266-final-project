First, I really wanted to love this phone. I don't know why my own phone should ring.3) The room monitor is convenient. I know it is a phone and not a baby monitor, but I use it for that on monitoring mode. Unfortunately, after plugging this phone into my line (Verizon phone service with DSL, DSL filter on the line), about 80% of the time the phone would not get a dial tone. Uniden CS was polite but unhelpful, so this phone (just as the other Unidens) had to be returned.I gave this unit two stars due to it's design, and my understanding that this phone must be working on *some* phone lines out there. I walked the phone to every corner of our lot including to the far corner of the garage which has a tent trailer and boat so there is pleanty of metal to block a signal. I got turned on to Uniden with my home-office phone and now have brought it into the living quarters. But each phone book entry can have 2 numbers--so you don't have to have multiple name entries for person (e.g. Dropping off is easy...just turn off the phone. You have to copy the phone books from one handset to another instead of it being sync'd across all handsets. I bought this to replace my Vtech 2GHz phone both because of interference with WiFi and because the buttons were getting harder and harder to push on most of the handsets (after 4 years).The phone is comfortable, easy to use, and clear in terms of sound and reading the LCD.Two things that really stood out for me:1. You can setup phone numbers (directory) and then push them out to all the handsets (or selected ones). I am disappointed with the phone and am returning it because:-- sound quality noticeably poor, it is tinny (to me and folks I call)-- zero consideration of voicemail. This phone has an answering machine (if I could buy one that didn't have one, I would), but you have the ability to turn it off.

I bought this phone after returning an AT&T; 5.8 GHz cordless set.

The phone has excellent range and voice quality, and its minor detractors are just that--minor.

HOWEVER, the phone book and CID system share memory, so it's a TOTAL of 100 numbers.
