I love these pens. These pens were also recommended by Joel Henriques on his website and book Made to Play! These are among the nicest pens I've ever used. They are perfectly balanced and the most comfortable pens I've used.I'm a writerDigital Photography FAQsand tend to color code my notes to make it easier to find things later on and having a lot of colors to choose from is important to me. And when it comes to pens, about once a year I'll splurge and buy myself a nice set of pens for note taking. These pens were well worth $20 for the kit. Also, I haven't tested this yet, but they say these pens won't dry out if you leave the caps off for an extended period of time.I just love everything about these pens: the feel, the weight and the smoothness of writing with them. If you art going to purchase these pens you may find the cheapest price (usually by 4 or 5 dollars) from Blick art supply. I love great pens and am always looking for more great colors to write with. I think these pens are super smooth and don't smear or bleed. These pens are excellent! I love these pens. When I saw how fine these pens were (0.3mm), plus they were on sale, I dove right in feet first and bought the 20 pack. Overall, these pens are an amazing value.NB: Please note that I did not purchase these pens from the merchant listed; I am only reviewing the product and not the merchant's services. These are FANTASTIC pens. They are such light pens too which is a great convenience for someone who spends a lot of time writing.
