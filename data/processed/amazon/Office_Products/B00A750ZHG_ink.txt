Having him use up all of my ink for various papers is less of an issue with this unit. I did have to pop in the ink twice because the first time it didn't initial the ink properly. Last, I find the ink to be pretty pricey.On balance, I'm disappointed that I couldn't get it hooked up to my wi-fi, but I'm pleased with the print, the ease, and the speed.The question is whether or not I would have bought this had I known that it couldn't be hooked up to wi-fi. The ink can also tend to dry out. Any ink cost savings will be severely diminished when a nozzle clean is performed. It has one large black ink cartridge. One ink cartridge lasted over 6 months with daily use! Setup was easy but not fast because priming the ink cartridge took several minutes. I have purchased the Epson Ultra ink cartridge and it will run approximately 2400 pages and costs around $40. The available black ink cartridges are large and reasonable. The ink is really high quality (Epson is the only brand I always prefer to after market, even in mass printing), and really cheap. To begin with, Epson has come up with their own DuraBrite Black ink. This DuraBrite ink is comprised of insoluble pigment particles, unlike inkjet ink with it's water soluble particles. This ink is not as dry or expensive as laser ink, and it is not as wet as inkjet ink. It is an ink that the market has been needing for a long time- cheap, yet durable, fade proof and water resistant that prints really sharp text. You cannot beat this ink for double sided printing with NO bleed-through! I found this ink prints sharpest on plain or matte paper- glossy paper is not as sharp, so I'm sticking to plain paper for the best results. When buying ink, I always buy the XL sizes- they save you a small fortune over time. You will also find an ink cartridge, a power cord, a Quick Start guide and the printer driver CD in the box.There is no printed users manual included. To be fair though I haven't run through a full ink cartridge with this new printer so I don't know how long it will last comparatively. Shake ink cartridge and attempt to insert into printer. We reluctantly remove the ink cartridge and I warn her of all the don't do this list associated with our actions.
