!Twist the BOTTOM of the pen, not the top -- and VOILA!!!) The pen is so pretty, it catches the eye. Each pen in the pack (4 pack of assorted colors) have lasted me over a month now and are still writing. Unfortunately, every pen (there are 4 in the package) leaves little globules of ink when writing. The Paper Mate Inkjoy has become my new favorite pen. Be careful with this pen. Since I can never find a pen when I need one, and deciding that piercing my finger with a needle and using my blood was probably not the best idea, I jumped at the chance to try out Paper Mate's new InkJoy pens. This is a nice looking pen that writes easily. I think this pen either doesn't fall fast enough or provide enough feedback that it is once again in the right place. I've become used to writing with a Uni-Ball Signo pen (I believe it's French-made). It goes completely around the pen in the area where you normally hold the pen while writing, but there is also a strip that goes the length of the pen. The pen is covered mostly in this rubber type substance that I cannot stand the feel of. How much can you say about a pen? Overall, not a terribly impressive pen. For a retractable pen, it's the top of the line. If you're looking for a median priced retractable pen, I highly recommend Paper Mate's new InkJoy. This pen does not wear my hand out as the ink flows smoothly. I don't have to struggle with the pen to get it to work even after a day or two of setting on my desk. I personally like a pen with a bit more weight to it, but overall a nice inexpensive pen. The pen's slender shape and light weight took a bit for me to get used to- and at first I thought they were a great deal lighter than other pens, but I put several on a scale and they actually turn out to be about average.The only issue we had was that after some of our more demanding writing test- the pens would accumulate a bit of ink on the tip that would make a spot at the beginning of a new line. "Aha" I said to myself, "this pen has a tip seal for freshness" it says so right here in the fine print near the bottom of the package!Lucky for me, nobody was around to notice that I had tried to use the pen prior to unsealing it.The grip is a little different than I am used to, but I think it would be easy to get used to.Now to the important stuff!I have large and awful handwriting, I generally need to use a fine point pen to be able to fill in a form.The Inkjoy pen is actually a medium, but the ink comes out very crisp and clear and thinner than most other medium point pens.The smear test, where you rub your hand across the words that you just wrote, resulted in a minor smear on my hand which washed off right away with a little soap and water.Overall I think this is a very good pen, certainly an improvement over the ones I usually use.In the interest of not ruining any more clothes doing laundry, I have decided not to submit this pen to the "ultimate" test, running it through the washing machine in a pocket of my work uniform! I noted that the first pen I pulled from the pack doesn't retract at all well; in checking the others, the retraction worked as one would expect. The pen comes with wax on the tips so the ink stays fresh. This pen, though it has a 1.0mm ball which is typical of thick pens, does have a medium line that one would expect from several years ago when a medium ballpoint was roughly 0.7mm. )To finish up, this is a comfortable pen, with stylish looks, but it's lacking when it comes to ink reliability. Just an ordinary pen lying around the house that came with a little glob of wax that thoroughly impressed me.
