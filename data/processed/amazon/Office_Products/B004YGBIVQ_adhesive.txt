The adhesive on these is just the same as always. These are nice because the adhesive doesn't lose its grab like traditional post it notes, and it lays flat instead of flapping in the breeze. If they had put the adhesive all the way at the bottom it would have been very difficult to peel the individual note from the pad. However, the bottom adhesive does prevent curling up, which is rather nice, when you're putting the notes onto flat pages, or flat surfaces. The adhesive on the top edge isn't that strong so I get sticky notes that flip up on both the top and bottom rather than just the bottom...The design itself is excellent if it weren't for the adhesion problem. Further, there's twice the adhesive, which helps hold the note tighter to any surface. First, the adhesive is somewhat weaker than the competing brand (Pos...). They could be reversed, or the adhesive could be considered to be on the sides, if we're splitting hairs. I think the adhesive is not strong enough on the bottom to hold to the wall but strong enough that when you take if off the stack it curls the paper some. Without the strong adhesive, the Avery notes don't fare as well when sticking to the wall, the door, the fridge, etc. Improve the adhesive and you'll improve the product. Instead, these have an additional adhesive strip about 3/4 of the way down the sheet from the top. The adhesive is at the top, like normal, and about half way between the bottom and the adhesive along the top. I assume the adhesive is up a little so that you can grab the note easier, but I wasn't impressed. These aren't bad but the extra adhesive isn't really much good. The additional adhesive prevents the note from curling up from the bottom and coming loose.
