The wrist ones need loading with one of the 6 refills included, the desk ones come preloaded. The other goes onto your wrist, dispenses the same way and is wonderful when wrapping presents! It is so easy to slip it on my wrist and have my hands free to fold the wrapping paper. They can be attached almost everywhere, and worn on the wrist as well, dispensing the perfect amount of tape each time, with no waste or mess. The wrist straps fit me but I have small hands and wrists, people with larger hands and wrists may have a problem with it being uncomfortable.. You can wrap it around your wrist or your fingers. I far prefer the wrist dispenser to the desktop one-- it's so convenient.Thanks, Scotch. I love using the wrist dispenser to wrap gifts, it makes it so much easier! I LOVE the wrist dispensers, and I'm not one for gimmicky stuff. It may be cheaper to buy the wrist dispensers separately if that's all you're looking for. The wrist dispensers are. You could wear one on each wrist for ambidextrous wrapping. You get two table-top and two wrist holders for tape. But with the Scotch Tape Pop-Up Tape Dispenser on my wrist - dang - I know where the thing is all the time! I kept it on my wrist, it was comfortable, the tape dispensed like it is supposed to (note: make sure you load it properly), and best of all, I never misplaced the tape! It's there, on your wrist with no need to wrestle with the tape since it's already pre-cut. The wrist model was a bit of a bear to get opened, and I ended up pushing too hard and the *door* came completely off. The wrist tape dispensers are comfortable and dispense easily. I find it more convenient on the wrist, so that it doesn't encumber the hand in any way. Which is probably where the wrist mounted dispenser comes in! First the better of the two is the wrist dispenser, which attached to your wrist like a bracelet. I have used the wrist strap pop up tape for years, and have never looked back. The wrist dispenser is a one-size fits all device, and the fit is not as tight on my slender wrists as I would have liked. So, all-in-all, I would consider the wrist units a bust...great idea, poor execution. You wear it on your wrist or hand, so you don't have to hunt under the wrapping paper and bows to find it every time you need it.2. I put the wrist dispenser on and low and behold it was a work of wonder. I had one of the wrist straps when they first came out.
