To say that pencil sharpeners are important is a vast understatement. When attempting to eject a too short pencil, you have to figure out how to plug in the sharpener, holding the sharpener, the pencil in place holding the reverse button on (let the pencil slip and the machine pulls the offending pencil in farther), and in my case, simultaneously hold a corkscrew or thin, sharp knife used to try to pry out the stuck pencil. This pencil sharpener works wonderfully, as long as you keep a few things in mind. Do not force the pencil into the sharpener." I put the pencil into the opening, the motor started, and then I just watched it stay there and vibrate without being pulled into the machine for sharpening. Finally, I gave the pencil a gentle nudge, and the machine FINALLY pulled it in to sharpen. As promised, when it was done, it ejected the pencil on its own.Those are really small allowances to make for a machine that does so much. When done, it ejects the pencil. If you take an already-sharpened pencil, you will see that it has some sensor and essentially shaves no more off. I really didn't think that a pencil sharpener could be so frustrating to people. It doesn't always grab the pencil with the same amount of pressure. Once it grabs the pencil, it won't let go easily. Instead of holding each pencil while it sharpens, you simply load the pencil and let the sharpener do its work while you sort out the rest of the pencils you have to sharpen and ready the next one.Unfortunately this sharpener missed a 5 star mark on a couple points. We go through a few pencil sharpeners a year!This one however is the best we have tried. It's a pencil sharpener. I never thought I would ever consider purchasing an electric pencil sharpener for the house, but with 2 girls in elementary school who always want THE SHARPEST pencils, and having the school request that 2 dozen per child at the beginning of each school year, and a little non-electric sharpener just wasn't cutting it.We currently have aX-ACTO Teacher Pro Electric Pencil Sharpener with SmartStop, Black (1675)that I paid about $13 for when I got a discount on school supplies through the kindle sponsored offers deals, but the current retail price is over $40. Electric pencil sharpeners in general are not quiet little appliances, but the noise is a minor inconvenience when compared to the speed and quality of manually doing it. You'd never find it in a hurry.- Part of a pencil broke off inside -- and to my disbelief, there is NO WAY TO TAKE THE SHARPENER APART to go in and retrieve the broken piece! After all, he only has to stick the pencil in the hole and wait until it is spit back out again.The only downside is that a pencil stub (shorter than 2 inches) gets stuck; it grinds forever and would eventually burning out the motor. This electric pencil sharpener is about as automatic as a pencil sharpener can be. It's no noisier than any other electric pencil sharpener I've used, and it makes a wickedly sharp point every time.The sleek chrome-like plastic cover can be removed easily to empty the shavings.Downsides? Sharpening a pencil should not take an entire minute! A typical pencil might take just 5 seconds. A pencil that has just a tiny bit of its tip broken off might take half a minute or more. I'm not really sure what's gained by pushing a pencil in to be sharpened, walking away and a minute later having a perfect pencil .I
