It has rings that you can snap open and closed to add and remove pages as needed, and you'll have to pick up your own dividers if you want them. I like that the rings are flat on one side, so keep pages nice and flat instead of them bunching up and needing to be shaken down before the binder will close properly, like my old binders.Easy-open rings, and nice that cover pages can be inserted in the clear pockets front, back, and spine; also nice, two inner clear pockets as well. The D-shaped rings are good and allow your sheets to lay flat for viewing. The rings are a D shape and the shape and placement allow the binder to lay flat and close easily every time. The &#8220;never-gap&#8221; rings have the opening toward the top rather than the center of the ring. The rings sit flat on the back cover instead of the spine, if that matters to you. The rings, though are a bit stiff and hard to open and close. The rings are situated on the back board of the binder, so all pages lay flat. The rings open and close with ease...I expect that it should last quite a while. I like the D rings because they hold more paper and when opened, papers don't fall out as with conventional rings.The white binder is not my first choice of colors but looks good and cleans up nicely. These rings help to prevent that.The claim is that these Polypro Binders last up to 10X longer. It also has my preferred D rings with the dimple closure which work very well. The rings also close super tight and pages don't get caught on them while being turned. The rings are somewhat easy to open and close for me, but it does take two hands. Finally, I love that the rings are D-rings and that they're mounted on the back cover rather than on the spine so that my pages stay nice and flat while in use.I have this binder in white and red and I  must say the red color is pretty accurate in the picture. I prefer D rings. The "D' rings work much better than the regular round rings and I think mounting the assembly on the back cover would make for a stronger binder.The binder has a guarantee so hang on to you receipt (maybe slip it into one of the little binder pockets?)

The rings are shaped in a manner that holds the numerous pages in place while not popping open unexpectedly.

The &#8220;D&#8221; shaped rings are a definite plus, as they help store paper more easily, and allow pages to be flipped more freely.The binders themselves are what you would expect, with plastic sleeves on the outside front, back and spine, into which you can slide paper with titles, labels, artwork, etc.There are two interior plastic pockets, one on the inside of each cover.The hinges work nicely.

Not so here &#8211; these rings snap together very nicely.The binder is advertised as being made of a &#8220;polypro&#8221; material and lasting up to 10 times longer than vinyl.
