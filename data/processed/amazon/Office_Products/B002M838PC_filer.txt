This filer fits letter sized papers, and there are clear dividers inside.The one drawback is that when I'm digging inside, the lid wants to flap closed and gets in the way. The Wilson Jones Pink 7 Pocket filer  is perfect and I use it for organizing all my coupons and newspaper flyers. The filer is lightweight, but seems sturdy with an easy to user plastic buckle closure. The filer holds quite a bit of stuff -- I have been carrying not only files and papers in it, but notebooks and a daily planner.At first I did not like it that the top of the filer is permanently bent in a crook-shape so that it automatically folds over. This filer is at once durable, convenient, and attractive. A wonderful filer. This seems like a good filer for the price. Like any multi-pocketed filer, this item is great for organizing related documents. I haven&#8217;t traveled with this Wilson Jones 7-pocket filer yet, but I am looking forward to doing so next week.What I Like: The biggest draw for me with this folder is the number of pockets. It also feels as though when this filer is stuffed full that the plastic separators may tear easily.For the time being, I&#8217;m giving this Wilson Jones 7-pocket filer a solid rating of 4 stars. This filer is perfect for filing the papers and business cards from meetings. This is a very durable 7-pocket filer. I used this filer in my roller laptop bag and barely filled it.
