I was very pleased with this tape. Do not thread the tape with the sticky side UNDER the roller. (I am tired of buying slightly cheaper tape rolls with half of the tape length. Duck makes great packing tape, and this is no exception.However, at twice the price of a larger size of standard clear packing tape, I have to wonder if the zebra stripe is worth it. It's packing tape. If you thread the tape properly through this dispenser (over the little grey pegs and under the white roller), then it flows right off the spool smoother than any tape gun I've ever used. I thought it would be &#34;cheap&#34; tape, but I'm impressed that it is as strong as it's shipping tape counter parts. It is transparent like packing tape, so please keep that in mind. Love this tape. The tape worked as advertised only maybe one out of five times. And the tape seems sturdy and sticky enough to do its job. I admit when I saw decorative tape from Duck Brand, I just assumed it was Duct tape. The tape is good quality and there's a generous roll of it. Although I had never used the comparable Duck Brand tape, I was happy to try it. I received the tape too late for Christmas wrapping, but I've used it since then to wrap two packages, as well as a couple of miscellaneous uses, and I like it. Packaging tape is thin plastic with enough adhesive for it to stick to smooth surfaces like a cardboard box. First this is made by the Duck tape brand we are used to, but it is not near as good as actual Duct Tape. Not with Duck tape!It has a really strong adhesive, so that you just need one piece to hold a cardboard box shut.It also doesn't split or come apart on the end, so that you have a nice straight end piece every time you go to cut the tape. Duck Brand is the best tape, plain and simple. I use packing tape a lot to ship packages and I'm very happy with this Duck tape. The tape doesn't shred apart, sticks well, and the dispenser works as it should. and the tape appears to be a bit thicker than the similar Scotch Shipping Tape I had been using. Duck Brand packing tape doesn't have the sticking power of my regular packing tape. This is not duct tape, but a thinner product good for sealing packages if you have a flair for the dramatic. I like the tape dispenser-it cuts tape well and and tape rolls well off the dispenser. This tape is really cute. The EZ tape rolls off the roll almost effortly---so much so, that you may have to find ways to slow it down with some professional dispensers (an easy adjustment with most).CONS10 or 20 years ago, this stuff was introduced and sold as a consumer product WITHOUT a dispenser as "easy tear tape" because you can easily tear it to length without a dispenser or scissors. )Love how this tape comes right off the roll.Good stuff, am ordering more!P
