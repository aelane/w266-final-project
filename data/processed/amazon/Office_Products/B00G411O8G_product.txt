If you want to do so with this product, use copies of the photos.Lamination is excellent for preserving photos and artwork but seek out someone with know-how and the proper materials/technique. They are not the stiffest/thickest laminating product but I rather prefer these that have a little flexibility. I've never had a faulty product from them and it's guaranteed quality every time. We did a product comparison in my office, laminating 2 sheets of paper back-to-back. A solid product I would definitely purchase again. Swingline makes a quality product that is worth the investment. The finished product was clean and smooth - very professional looking. The product comes out smooth and shiny, protecting the item you've laminated. Nice product. They worked well and provided a nice clear - not cloudy - finished product. The finished laminated product is not a stiff product, but rather a flexible due to the 3 mil pouches which is what I needed for these projects. This product gives a solid clear finish that is top notch! For a product that's flexible and essentially unbreakable, I found that to be rather excessive. Good product! It is a good product. Swingline's Thermal Laminating Pouch product provides a good solid product at a great price. I would recommend this product in the 100 Pouch Pack.

This is a plus if you hate having to trim the product or have a laminator that &#34;just&#34; accomodates the letter size.The teacher in the family prefers the pouches with a bit more edge, since she laminates in large quantities and prefers not to use so much time making sure the paper fits &#34;just so&#34; inside the pouch before feeding it through the laminator and appreciates having a bit more edge around the finished laminated product, since many of the laminated items she uses get hung-up in her classroom or go through a lot of &#34;hands-on&#34; use.
