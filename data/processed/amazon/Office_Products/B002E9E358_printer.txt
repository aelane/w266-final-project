That being said, I quickly became a Lexmark printer fan. So this printer does a lot more than just scan, copy and print.One last thing that I want to mention is that when I was using the Lexmark X83, although I loved the machine one of my pet peeves was that when the electricity went off, like during a summer storm, the printer, even though it was off, when the juice was restored, it would turn on, and place the cartridge in the middle of the carriage, and just sit there for days drying out, unless I would notice it, and go over and hit the power button, which would immediately park the cartridge in the protective position. I'm been using this printer for about a month and so far it's been great. This printer can be set up on the wireless and it comes with a USB cable...  Well, I guess it's always good to have a USB cable just in case! But, I do know that I like the printer very much and appreciate how easy it is to use and how nice my prints come out. Setting this printer up for the first time is a bit interesting. Setting the printer to work when connected to the computer takes a while of watching the software work, but is pretty brainless. I was so surprised how easy it was to use this new printer with all its cool functions. The printer is very quiet. ;-) The printer was a perfect match to the computer, which is an MSI touchscreen and is small enough to fit almost anywhere. This printer walks you through the complete procedure using the CD and the LCD screen on the printer. Again, this is where the Lexmark is different from any other printer. This printer does have the capability of duplexing, which does add to the features.Next feature tried from the LCD control panel on the printer was scanning. Is this a printer I would use for a small business - No. Is this a printer I would use for the home office? Is this a printer I would have for personal use, most definitely. The printer setup and installation took all of some 20 minutes, yes, not quick, but I had to connect it to my wireless network, etc.
