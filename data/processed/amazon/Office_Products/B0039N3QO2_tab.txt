According to 3M, when the tab loses its stickiness you can wash the dust off it. These Scotch Reusable Tabs are perfect!Each tab is qualified to hold up to .25 lb, so I guess I'll skip the load testing I had planned. Obviously because each tab was unable to fully touch the wall due to the slightly concave nature of the mask, this was the main reason it fell even though when I first put the mask on the wall it seemed secure despite this fact. One tab secured my Wii Fit Motion detector on my flat screen TV top at ease- How many times have I replaced normal tape for that? Each reusable clear tab can hold up to four ounces. I was also pleased the sticky tab did not leave a mark on my poster when I removed it.They are a great alternative to tacks or magnets. Also when the tab was removed from the wall it removed the paint from it. After this happened I washed the tab and I was able to reuse it without any problems!I would strongly recommend these as a substitute for tacks. I had to remove the tab from the wall and the photo, adjust the position, and re-attach to the wall. Well with this tab, you can hang him on the wall.I wouldn't recommend using these tabs for heavy framed art. I have only peeled one tab off the wall and it didn't do any damage to the paint. And yes, 1 tab should easily handle a small sheet of glass (like for a floating frame)--they are very sticky, and yet they didn't damage the paper I hung on the wall let alone the wall itself.

Also, each tab holds up to 0.25lb or 113 grams.

One tab came clean.

The tab is easily removed from surfaces and hanging objects without leaving any marks and I believe that they would be relatively permanent if they were not removed on purpose.
