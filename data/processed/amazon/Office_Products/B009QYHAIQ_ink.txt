The ink and the orange inks don't show up as well/The best thing is that the ink does not smear or smudge. I've had colorful ink pens before, but most have been disappointingly faint and hard to see. What's most impressive to me is that the ink does not run when it gets wet. - which appears to only be available in blue, black, or red ink. The Acroball ink does not run if wet; I cannot yet speak to the fading issue.I also have not tested the Acroball for writing checks, as I so seldom write checks these days. The ink flows evenly and easily. Be aware that the ink needs time to dry or it smears. These are nice gel ink pens - smooth writing and vibrant colors. I'm not sure about this new ink. But it is a thin ink, not as much fun to draw with as a true gel pen. The hybrid ink allows the pens to write as smoothly as gel pens, but the ink looks and dries like a ballpoint pen.

The Acroball ink is more water resistant (doesn't smear if the paper gets wet after the ink dries) compared to the G2 ink (which does smear somewhat when wet).

The ink doesn't flow smoothly and it is not all that vibrant.

The ink doesn't flow as easy as in a gel pen.On the plus side, the pen itself comes in pretty bright color.
