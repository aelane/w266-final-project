)The adhesive doesn't work with plastic, but paper to paper it is fantastic! This is a permanent adhesive... This adhesive is easy to use and easy to replace when it runs out for pretty much the same price. Applying the adhesive is simple and neat. The adhesive is tidy and strong, and the applicator is well designed. The adhesive is so easy and strangely fun to apply, you'll find yourself making up excuses to use it.Why dots? This is a manageable and non-messy adhesive for lightweight papers. Thus you only transfer the actual adhesive to the back of your photo, no tape, no double sided tape, just a photo with a precise amount of adhesive backing at the edge.Flipping the photo over and applying mild pressure to the edge permanently sets it into most scrapbook pages, especially those with their own adhesive inside a protective layer. This may not be strong enough adhesive for some things, so you'll want to make sure it can hold what you need it to - the package doesn't really identify what the limits are of what this would be useful for. I was able to adhere it back on, though I can see that if I pull hard enough, it'll come off... but still, this adhesive isn't made for fabric, and I was impressed that it does as well as it does on that.For paper projects, this is fantastic. The adhesive is rather strong, about as strong as double sticky tape, but infinitely more convenient and easy-to-use. I also noticed that this is supposed to be a permanent adhesive; after gluing some magazine clippings to a paper I came back and checked them a couple hours later. The adhesive is quite strong, and it's very fast and easy to use. I simply roll out the adhesive on the closing flap and close up the envelope. The adhesive is strong enough to hold everything closed before I apply the more sturdy packing tape.I've also used this adhesive in applying mailing labels on my packages as well. You can place the adhesive to the very edge of what you're pasting down without the worry of messy overspill and it seems to hold well. It has a nice sticky adhesive that comes out as dots.3. The adhesive so far seems pretty strong but only time will tell.7. The adhesive does all you to re-adjust the paper if you do it right away before it sets. I couldn't have been more wrong.The adhesive is really more like solid pinhead-sized bits of rubber cement, arranged in  rows on a cellophane backing. Also, I find that it was fun to roll the adhesive on. Just roll the adhesive on the paper and it sticks instantly!
