I am pleased to see Post-It create an environmentally friendly product. This is a product I would purchase again and appreciate that there is a recycled option available. it is hard to believe that these are a green product. Great product. As always these are a good product. Thank you 3M for making this new product for those of us who care about They have always been a great product, but now these are made from recycled paper and with a vegetable-based adhesive. Thank you for another wonderful Post-it product. When they can make a product as good or better AND be more 'green' doing so, we all win. I definitely like any green product made from recycled material. This product is made from 100% recycled paper and plant based adhesive. Great product by 3M, I'm all for it! Overall, this is a very good product and I would buy them again if there is not a significant price increase over regular Post-Its. Unfortunately, I think this product is way too expensive. Overall, a good product.
