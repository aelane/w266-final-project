I have very small hands so found them comfortable to hold. I have very small hands and they will sometimes cramp when I am writing. I have small hands and they are easy to hold and write with for a long time. But these are too small for adult male hands to use for long. My hands fit into women's medium gloves, and are not "man hands".Because these are low-end BIC pens, without even the rubberized barrel of the Clic Stic pens which cost $4. I have average sized hands, and am a "her", so I figured that this pen would fit my hand better. I have medium-sized hands, and find these pens too thin. My hands tend to get cramped when I write for more than a few minutes but I was pleased to see that that doesn't happen with these pens. I don't know whether I have slender hands or not, but if anything, I'd say I have to grip these pens a little harder, which means it will be more uncomfortable in the long run, since I have arthritis in my fingers. I have small hands...my 11 year old nephew has bigger hands then I do if that gives you some idea. I have never thought my hands were so small that I needed a special pen. Not for those with larger hands or fingers. I find them best for smaller hands.
