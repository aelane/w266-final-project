The wrist gel is comfortable, the entire bottom is tacky to prevent sliding, and the mouse surface consists of a thin, stiff plastic material with a bit of a rough feel to offer just enough friction to slide the mouse comfortably. The gel wrist rest attached at the bottom of the pad is an excellent size and shape and is quite comfortable as well. The wrist rest is nice. My wrist used to hurt so bad that I had to massage it for 10 minutes to get the feeling back. My wrist doesn't get achy so much as it feels kind of rubbed almost raw (not raw so much as just irritated...I don't know a better word off hand) when I have it laying on the desk while I move the mouse around. I constantly put my wrist down while working on the computer and often have it having off the desk so that by the time I'm done working on the computer my wrist hurts. Even better, my wrist had been bothering me from too much computer work; this alleviated that strain. The gel wrist rest supports you wrist and takes the strain off when you use it frequently. The wrist gel offers good support, not too soft and appears to be very durable. The gel wrist rest is very comfortable, and definitely eases fatigue on your wrist. For me it is fine as long as I keep my wrist on the guard. I wouldn't mind it slightly softer, but it's the most comfortable wrist rest I've come across yet.For a medium-sized mouse, the surface space is reasonable and the texture allows my optical mouse to glide smoothly across without problems. It appears very durable and the wrist rest is guaranteed by 3M not to leak.At a good price, with its one-year warranty and a design that is sure to brighten up desks (and possibly even moods! The gel wrist rest is hard for me to get used to, having never used one before, but relatively comfortable after getting used to it. Very comfortable on the wrist. The wrist rest is gently curved in terms of its outline and arched across the top. The gel wrist rest is pretty comfortable and did help to alleviate the pain I was feeling when I'm using the computer for a long period of time. I'm not saying this will eliminate all wrist pain but it did seem to help me. No less important is the gel-based wrist rest that is quite different from the standard padded wrist rest - more comfortable and more able to form to the position of your hand and wrist.Computers are a necessity of today's life, and ensuring your arm, wrist and hand are ergonomically cared for while spending long hours at the computer are equally important. Where you rest your wrist at feels like of spongy and cool and feels great. The gel wrist pad is nice - it actually feels cool. Having that wrist pad forces me to use more ergonomic technique. Add a gel wrist rest and you're set, but could be just a little wider as I find my big, fat Microsoft mouse slipping off the edges every once in a while; however, this is typical of the gel wrist style pads out there. This also keeps the gel wrist rest in perfect position so that using my mouse with this pad almost makes it an extension of my hand. The wrist rest is a clear gel that offers perfect support not too hard or too soft. Having this perfectly placed non-skid wrist rest will be just another tool in my arsenal for avoiding repetitive stress wrist injuries. The gel wrist rest is just enough to put your wrist in a comfortable position when holding the mouse. The other gel wrist mouse pad I have is made of fabric and I was concerned since one is plastic but it's just as comfortable. Upon trying out the gel wrist rest on this product, we found it to be a real nice change. Definitely recommended for wrist relief and in general being a quality product that you shouldn't have to replace for a long time. The gel wrist pad is really comfortable too. The wrist rest is comfortable. It is also quite practical as it combines the wrist rest which is a great feature with the mouse pad. The gel wrist rest provides just the right amount of support to prevent the wrist from fatigue. I also found the gel wrist rest to be really comfortable. The wrist pad is wonderful. I think the wrist rest might have been a bit more comfortable with a gel pad that wasn't quite so high or firm. My gel keyboard wrist rest is perhaps a little bit more comfortable, but the wrist rest on the mouse pad is pretty good, too.- The material the mouse interfaces with is good for either a laser mouse or an older ball-type mouse- The pad's backing is grippy and doesn't slide around much- I like the sunrise picture design ... The wrist gel area is 1 3/4 inches long by 5 inches wide by 3/4 inches deep.
