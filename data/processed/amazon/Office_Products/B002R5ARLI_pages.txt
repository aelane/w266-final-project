The first 9 pages are simple worksheets for the child to practice numbers 1-9 and each page shows the child how to properly write the number and gives a little rhyme on how to remember the strokes. It would also have helped if the pages were perforated. There are pages that allow kids to practice their number-writing skills. The pages have one line about what a number looks like, but it's not a story you'd read to a child, which is why I had requested it-- I thought it would be engaging to learn that way.Aside from that, it's useful and colorful. He's not excited about the pages made for practicing writing numbers - that's too much like work. You can photocopy the pages too so you can keep reusing them if needed. It does only have 40 pages which seems a little short, but everything is bright and colorful and the worksheets seem to have a lot of thought put into them. There are pages for other number related things like telling time, counting coins, creating a calendar page, and learning a telephone number.This workbook is not very long so it covers most topics only once but a parent using this to reinforce what the child is learning in the classroom or to supplement during the summer can easily build upon the foundation laid out in this book to continue practicing the concepts. These pages are in full color and a lot of fun to look at! The first few pages simply make the reader trace the digits from 0 to 1, which he got bored with considering how an entire page would be devoted to a single digit. He tried some pages in the middle, and then skipped to the last few pages on basic subtraction. That said, there are only 34 actual pages of activities.
