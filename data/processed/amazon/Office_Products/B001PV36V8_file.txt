Comparing to usual sticky file folder tabs, much better. To put a regular file folder tab over the writing works great for the first time but after a time or two, the tab becomes bulky. I put some on my frequently used file folders to help me locate the files more quickly. They're particularly nice with non-tabbed file folders, since you would not otherwise have a staggered top tab in each folder. I used them on hanging file folders in my desk. These file folder tabs work perfectly for that-- and much more. I went out and bought more and found them handy when it came to labeling my file folders. These are awesome for file folders, notebooks, textbooks, books and things along that line. These brightly colored Post-It file tab labels are perfect for highlighting those files that are constantly in use. Before I got these, whenever I needed to start a new file I had to find those little hanging file folder plastic tabs for labeling (those tabs tend to scatter about my office supply drawer), and cut a little piece of paper to write on (this is the worst part) and then stick it in the plastic tab and then stick that into the hanging folder. But it's enough that I'll procrastinate and we had more than one hanging file folder in our cabinets that had no label because I simply wasn't doing it.That's why I jumped at the opportunity to use these stick-on filing tabs. Love these and they are durable, they are perfct for file folders and binders.

The larger file labels live up to their name when first taken out of the package.

I have to thumb through file after file until I come upon the right one.
