The laminator comes with a few laminating pouches in a few different sizes. )Nice, easy to use laminator if you have a need. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this laminator is to use. I have an old laminator and this one has a few good features.- it has an auto shutoff- it has a cold feature for cold lamination- it heats up twice as fast as traditional laminates...about a minute.This is my to to laminator these days The Black & Decker Flash Thermal Laminator (LAM95) is the second laminator I've received and used. This little laminator is a useful and fun addition to my home office. The laminator heats up quickly and lets you know when it is ready for use. The laminator lets them be passed down a generation.Let kids play Top Chef for a night and create their own menus.It works in a snap and can be figured out very easily. It is great to have a personal laminator in the office. If you only use a laminator occasionally, this is a very good option to get the job done. This is the second laminator that I have reviewed. I love this laminator! I would have expected a laminator with this much to offer to be a bit more expensive since it offers just a bit more than some that are more expensive. The other laminator that I have is black, but the white looks so much cleaner sitting in my very girly sewing/craft room, and it hardly takes up any room at all. I've been using a laminator for many years at home to laminate job aids for a crazy job that had numerous sheets I needed to protect and have access without worry about them getting worn. The old laminator was starting to develop issues (from much use over the years) so it was time to start hunting for that new laminator.I'm really pleased with the Black and Decker Flash Laminator. This is a nice laminator for many uses. My other laminator didn't come with one: =1 point.While I was letting the machine cool before putting it away, I decided to try the corner hole punch. When I turned on this laminator from room temperature (~70F) it took less than 120 seconds to warm up. This Black and Decker laminator competently meets my needs. I have never used a laminator before, so had no real expectations.This one heats up super fast and was easy to use - we laminated all the index card my son was using for studying, we laminated a bunch of old artwork that had started to fade (up to 8 1/2 x 11,)we laminated some doilies and some old vacation memories....in short, we laminated just about anything we could find.Since this is my first laminating experience, I don't have any point of reference, but the machine was really easy to use.

It was very frustrating, and their 800# wasn't answered though I felt a little silly in calling them about a laminator.
