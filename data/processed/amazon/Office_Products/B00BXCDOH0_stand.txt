This stand elevates your laptop so you're sitting up and typing directly on a slightly tilted keyboard surface. This is a lightweight stand for desktop use of a laptop.The main role for this is to have a place for the laptop to reside on a desktop while1. I am using this stand withToshiba L855-S5372 15.6" Laptop with 3rd Generation Intel Core i7-3630QM Processor, 6GB memory, 640GB Hard Drive, Windows 8 - Mercury Silverand it makes typing so much easier and more comfortable. This stand will easily work perfectly for a larger or smaller device.I love the "lift" or height that this stand gives. I had been using a different stand previously, but this one is much better as far as the height and the angle. This stand is perfect for that. The laptop stand is light weight (it's made of high quality plastic) and seems durable. With this stand, my laptop becomes quite hot after 1.5 hrs of web browsing. Before this stand, I used another Fellowes one for my laptop at home, and it proved its worth--for a while. For that, the stand works marvelously. Plus, I can take my old stand to work and finally have proper posture there too.I can't see using this by itself.

This is a nice stand, and I like having my laptop screen elevated, but it's not a natural position for typing.

I find this stand to be surprisingly functional, stylish, and well constructed.The stand works by placing the laptop on the sloped surface.

It's simplicity itself: a stand (or "lift" --roll eyes--) for laptops.
