Do you like to make labels? I use these to make customized labels or jars or storage boxes, and when my kids are lucky we use them for special art projects. They would also make excellent labels for homebrewing.It would be nice to have a choice of colors, glossy and luster finishes, and finer scoring on the back for smaller stickers. I love Avery labels! The labels print flawlessly every time. I got these labels with a specific purpose in mind. These labels hold the ink very well. I used this with Borderbund Print Shop and was able to make labels for some Christmas gifts and to use on packages. Plus, the labels have a removable adhesive, something I consider a plus. The labels run through my printer with ease. The labels are repositionable if you don't get it on straight the first time but I expect they will become permenant eventually if left in place.
