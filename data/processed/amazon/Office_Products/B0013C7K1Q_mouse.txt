The mouse pad not only does the usual mouse pad work of letting your mouse glide easily, but it relieves any wrist strain (I have fibromyalgia and this mouse pad helps elevate my wrist pain). My old mouse pad was actually bigger. My last mouse pad (which also had a gel wrist rest) was constantly sliding around and getting shoved off the tray. This mouse pad has been staying put quite nicely.There is an ample amount of gel inside the wrist rest to firmly hold your wrist without it squishing down. 3M's mouse pad with gel wrist rest has a sharp, colorful, and bright image of a beach scene on the mousing area and underneath the wrist rest. The mouse pad is beautiful, very cheery, and it is comfortable; the gel completely relieves pressure in the wrist.

This mouse pad is somewhat smaller than the Belkin mouse pad that I have been using for many years. The actual mouse pad surface seems to have a very fine texture which should benefit the mouse's resolution. I am using a Microsoft mouse and it works very well on this surface. The Belkin mouse pad wears out after a year or so because the cloth like surface becomes too smooth and slick. That is why I switched back to a Microsoft mouse. My Microsoft mouse really glides surprisingly well on the surface of this 3M mouse pad. The mouse pad is thick, about three sixteenths of an inch thick.

We've always had basic mouse pads (the really floppy kind that seem like you'd open a jar with them) or the stiff-backed kind (which seem like the floppy kind but that are attached to a thicker material). So I was happy to try this mouse pad. I didn't notice how our other mouse pad moved around so easily until I put this one down and it doesn't budge. Find your comfortable mouse position and the mouse will stay exactly where you put it. Much better than a standard mouse pad. This mouse pad is half the width of the one I've been using for years so I thought it might be too narrow. This mouse pad does the job in excellent fashion and it is sturdy and durable.

I have not had a mouse pad in ages since technically laser mouses don't really need a mouse pad. I absolutely love this mouse pad. The 3M mouse pad is a little small for my own personal taste, but the gel wrist rest is wonderful I have been using if for the past week and a half and offers support which lessens the strain and has reduced wrist pain which most often this pain is related to carpal tunnel. I really like this mouse pad - a lot, in fact. With other mouse pads, including the two older 3M pads mentioned earlier, tracking on them w/ laser mice can be hit or miss, with delays, skips, etc. This mouse pad's surface works ideally.Also, this mouse pad is a bit smaller than the other two 3M pads mentioned, so it fits better on my crowded desktop. Yet, despite this mouse pad's smaller size, I still can track from one edge of the screen to the other at my preferred tracking speed without lifting & repositioning the mouse - even on my 27" iMac.The wrist rest on this mouse is gell filled, with a soft vinyl surface. I find it as comfortable to use as my older 3M mouse pads' rests, which are also both gell-filled, but with woven nylon surfaces. I always use a mouse pad with a wrist rest to avoid hurting my wrist due to over use of my mouse. The mouse pad area is 6 1/2 long by 6 3/4 wide by 1/8 inch deep. I can't say for certain that it's this mouse pad that's helping or if the relief is caused by other factors and only temporary, but there's no down-side to using this pad either way. Given that I needed a new mouse pad anyway, getting one that is ergonomically correct was a no-brainer.

Normal mouse pads kind of make it worse, just by the nature of their texture.
