This Fellowes laminator can take laminator pouches up to 12 inches wide and 18 inches long. This laminator is also heavy, weighing approximately 15 pounds. The laminator will heat up in slightly under a minute from room temperature. This laminator accommodates pouch thickness from 3 to 10 mils. Make sure the laminator is at room temperature before running any cold lamination. I don't have any cold laminator pouches, nor do I have any use for them. This Fellowes Jupitor2 laminator is easy to operate, heats up fast, and gets the job done in a jiffy. This is very well designed and capable laminator. Very, very nice laminator! This is a very nice and east to use laminator. This is a really cool laminator. The laminator is super quick and in about 30 seconds I had a fully ready to go laminated 8.5x11 document (using one of the pouches included; 3-mil). This laminator is awesome! I was always very cautious using my other laminator and felt unsafe sometimes given the heat. This laminator is very nice.. This is quite easily the best laminator money can buy! This laminator is ready to go quickly, the slot is 13 inches wide but it supposedly only takes pages up to 12.5 inches wide.It feeds pages through quickly and they come out cooler than my old laminator. They also came out very flat, where my old laminator seemed to leave everything with a slight curve. This is an extremely easy to use laminator. The Jupiter2 is a great laminator and works well for the small office and home. This laminator simply requires turning it on. Be aware that this laminator isn't something you tuck in a corner of your desk; it has a substantial footprint at about 21 1/2 inches wide by 7 inches. We have historically used a less expensive laminator, and have been quite satisfied, but we didn't know what we were missing. I would have thought that a laminator this calibre was overkill for people like us, but now after having experienced the upgrade, if you can afford it, I would recommend it.The speed that this thing warms (less than a minute) makes laminating less of a chore; our previous laminator took 5-10 minutes. I have been impressed with this Fellowes Venus 2 laminator. This is a laminator made for me. The laminator is very compact (the one at work has its own cart!). I don't use a laminator very often, but when I do, I do a lot of it at once. The laminator does an amazing job. I also found the laminator to be rather slow. The Scotch laminator is noticably faster than this machine, but since it produces better results I won't complain too much about the slower speed.This machine isn't one that you will just pick up and carry with you to your child's club meeting or a CCD class. Wow, I really like this laminator. This isn't the first laminator that I've used - back when I was teaching I made use of a number of different units, but none as nice as this one.Like I mentioned I bought some over and under-sized pouches to test this unit with. I received both this laminator and the Neptune3 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HXLP56I). This laminator did well, I found that I could laminate anything I tried from thin paper all the way to heavy cardstock. This laminator also has the ability to laminate up to 10 mil pockets as well as using cold lamination film. Very happy with the laminator. I have never owned a laminator so I don't have anything to compare it with. Plus I never before saw a laminator quite so attractive in appearance! This is an incredible laminator. If you want a laminator that can handle anything you can throw at it, this is the one. The Fellowes Venus2 laminator heated up more quickly and the finished products were cooler after ejection compared to my smaller laminator. They are holding well, while those made with my smaller laminator peeled apart without having a border around them. This is an excellent laminator that is well worth the price! It actually seems to warm up faster than our new Swingline GBC Fusion laminator (which is also a high quality product!) This laminator is super heavy duty and HEAVY; you won't want to move this too often. It's nice that this laminator detects what mil pouch is going through so you don't have to manually change it for 3, 5, or 10 mil sizes (I haven't used it for cold pouches). The Fellowes Laminator Venus2 laminator is a high-quality machine for laminating documents, photos, clippings, etc. The laminator arrives well-packaged and protected by Styrofoam on the ends. The laminator itself is fairly heavy compared with low-cost machines, and there are rubber feet on the bottom to keep it from sliding around on your work surface.There is a power switch in the back of the laminator that has to be turned on for it to be operational. The laminator automatically senses the thickness of the pouch, adjusts temperature accordingly, and quickly dispenses your freshly laminated item out a slot in the back of the unit. I own a Scotch laminator that Amazon sells for about $30. It would be an ideal laminator in a school setting due to its cool exterior making it very safe for usage with children. This laminator truly exceeded all my expectations.Starting from the beginning: setup was a breeze. My little SWINGLINE laminator and I sat before the cozy fire oblivious to the fact that something was coming....coming.. that would change our relationship forever. I currently own Fellows most expensive laminator which I guess will be discontinued and updated with a new line much like this current model.
