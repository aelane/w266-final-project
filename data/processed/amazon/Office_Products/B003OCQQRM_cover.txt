The customizable cover has a pocket large enough to accommodate documents you want to pull out quickly. I like the cover of it. The customizable cover is cool because he can designate what class it is for or whatever he really wants with this. They would need to be stacked closely since the cover is not sturdy. The cover is a matte frosted cover, so if you do decide to customize the binder with a picture in the cover pocket, it does tend to look a bit washed out. I would have preferred to have a less frosted out cover and the rings mounted on the back cover of the binder to have flat lying papers, but am overall happy with what I got. I think the customizable cover is such a fun idea--wish I'd had that back in the 80s. Most flexible cover binders support fewer than 300 pages. It has a clear cover with a pocket behind it so that you're able to slide whatever you'd like into. The clear cover has a slightly rough finish like a frost shower curtain, so the picture behind it can be a little unclear unless it is pressed right up to the cover.The binder is about 3/4" wider than most of our other binders, which helps protect the paper edges. What this has going for it is the flexible cover. If you're really wanting a flexible cover because a hard cover will get beat up in your backpack and will feel stiff in there, this is a good choice and appears sturdy enough to last through the school year. It's flexible enough that you can fully flip the top cover underneath so it's not spread out all over your desk as you're taking notes and stuff.
