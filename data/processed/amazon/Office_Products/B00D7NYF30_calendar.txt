While it may not be the most aesthetically pleasing planning calendar, it certainly is the most well laid out and simplest to use. This is a very lightweight and bendable calendar. The calendar spaces are a good size, large enough to write 2 or 3 things per day. It's perfect for this calendar because the matchbox is about the same size as the calendar squares, allowing precise erasing.It's extremely useful being able to see four months of planning/appointments at a glance. Yes, I have a calendar on my phone but this is great to just quickly turn my head and see what my week looks like or even next month for that matter. This calendar is large enough to see but not so huge that it takes up your whole wall. This calendar is quite large - so plenty of room to write in the daily boxes - but not so large that you can't post it anywhere. This does what it's supposed to do -- it's a wipe-away calendar. I've been wanting a multi-month calendar, but I didn't want it to take up an entire wall. I think this calendar allows plenty of room to write down what needs to be noted, but it's not so large that it overwhelms the space. A very nice, handy calendar dry erase board.
