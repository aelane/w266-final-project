When you write using just the tip you get a slim print, when using the whole end you get a thicker print. Do make sure you retract the tip before putting in your pocket/purse. I should mention that the tip is more narrow than the larger diameter barrel style highlighters but no more so than other pen types. Some may like the unique tip, but as I neither write nor underline with my highlighters, I'd prefer a more standard tip. I also love that you can actually write with these because of the tip design, as I frequently like to make notes on the side when I'm reading text and highlighting. Only the 4mm long tip is made of traditional material. The tip will make a thin line for underlining and it will make a thicker line depending how you hold the marker. The tip is a tiny bit more narrow than a standard highlighter but it actually works in its favor. The chisel-cut tip doesn't seem to wear out or flatten or lose shape.

Retractable tip eliminates lost caps, dried out markers, and is easy to use.

Additionally, being able to retract the tip between use means fewer stray marks on paper, clothing, etc.The colors are really excellent too, vibrant and a pleasure to use.The one issue with these highlighters (and the reason for a 1-point deduction) is that the writing on the side of them quickly wears off.

The retractable tip works well - after several months the pens are all still "juicy" and work great.
