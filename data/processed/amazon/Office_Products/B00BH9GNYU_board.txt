I decided NOT to hang my board. What is there to say about a dry-erase board? The board is not loose in the frame as so many of these less expensive white boards are. I like this dry-erase board. My first dry-erase board for home use so I don't have much experience in this arena but from what I can tell, it's a good value for the purchase. Highly recommended white board that you can write and write and write and erase and erase and erase, and it comes handy for daily announcements, for short messages, etc. This is a pretty good board and it looks great but the problem I have is that the boarders on it are pretty thick. The board erases cleanly, thought, which is always a benefit, and really is one of the most important aspects. This a great board for the price. Overall a great board and great size. She can use this board to show children something she has written - like a letter or number. This board satisfies those criteria. I was looking a larger board and this one is ideal. Very attractive, easy to hang and very sturdy, if you need a larger board, you can honestly do no wrong here. With this board, hung up in the garage, I have lines drawn between each car's service history and use different color pens to make quick work of keeping them separate (bought separately). Nice...The board comes with magnets so I can attach scraps of paper from the boxes that have part numbers for oil or air filter to keep track of the proper part number for the next service.Overall, it works (for me) as I intended. This is a standard white board. Its not a massive board so check the size before ordering. Great white board. This white board comes with 2 decorative magnets and a dry erase pen that has a magnet on one side of the cap and an eraser on the tip - very handy. This 23 x 17 dry-erase board is a decent product. The board is mounted with two screws (included) and it's a relatively easy job to get it up on the wall.Also included are two magnets as well as a cheap marker. The Quartet Magnetic Dry-Erase board is a no-frills 17 x 23&#8221; board that sets up easily and does the job well.The board comes packaged with hardware to install it, two magnets, and a black marker. The board simply slips into the brackets and stays in place. You will also need to clean the board, periodically, with a dry-erase cleaning solution (You can make your own by diluting 70% isopropyl [rubbing] alcohol 1:3 with water. The board itself seems good. The Quartet Dry Erase board does i&#8217;s job well! This board comes with a small dry erase marker with a tiny eraser on the end as well as two magnets to hold small memo&#8217;s on the board. The board itself is easy to write on, and easy to wipe off, just remember that if you leave writing on for a while that it will stain, and you&#8217;ll have to use a cleaner to get it off. The board is easy to hang and I would definitely recommend it. Okay - this board could only be improved if it was cork also! This board comes with a few magnets (you can use your own, of course) plus a marker with a rub-away eraser on the other end. This board has taken some review hits because one has no choice of frame--it will be either black or wood. I put this board up in my office at work. Well, this board has NO chalk tray - at all. This erasable board is the right size for a kitchen or workroom to keep track of chores or groceries to be bought; if you want something for office use or listing prices at a farmer's market, you'll want one twice as large. It's a very good-looking board. I rated Quartet Dry Erase board 4 stars because it works well.

We'd been thinking about getting such a board for a long time, but for some reason never got around to it.

It looks like it could be peeled off.The board itself seems like any other dry-erase board I've used (and is magnetized, like a smaller dry-erase board I have on my fridge).

Then slide the board down onto the brackets.
