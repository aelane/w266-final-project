The dispenser you wear is comfortable and offers great portability when you're wrapping something too big to fit on a table, and the tabletop model really does suction itself quite well to the surface, and picks up when you want it to. The dispenser secures to your hand or wrist with a comfortable elastic strap, and you pull nicely sized strips of tape from it. This attractive dispenser can sit anywhere but it will suction to any hard surface like a desk or table.This is a great set to get before you start all that holiday gift wrapping. It's so easy to put the dispenser on your fingers or use the table-top dispenser and end up with perfectly sized pieces every time. The Deskgrip dispenser is great, but for wrapping presents the Handband dispenser is absolutely phenomenal! This dispenser has pre-cut tape, so all one needs to do is pull. The dispenser stays comfortable and doesn't interfere with other tasks while you are wearing it. I used the 'hand--held' dispenser (which worked great and was convenient) much more than the desktop one (which needs a flat smooth surface to stay unmoved). Additionally, with that dispenser, you need to pull the tape at the really correct angle to keep the dispenser from moving.If you already are used to regular tape dispensers, this is not a necessity... just adds convenience of pre-cut tapes. If they could make the dispenser easier to open that would be great.I also like that the deskgrip dispensers use a suction cup to affix to a work surface so that you can dispense tape with one hand. First there is the Deskgrip dispenser, which features rubber grips on the bottom that keep the dispenser from sliding around on the floor or table. This dispenser is very helpful if you find yourself needing one hand to hold the wrapping paper together and another to apply the tape. This dispenser remedies that.Tape strips are easily dispensed from both the Deskgrip and the Handband. Scotch(R) Pop-Up Deskgrip dispenser is the best thing I have found for wrapping presents. I had a wrist dispenser several years ago and loved it, so I was looking forward to getting another one. I'm certain that this dispenser speeded up my Christmas wrapping by 10-15 minutes over using traditional tape rolls.I love Scotch brand tape for its invisibility and long lasting hold. The dispenser would try to stick, but that last pull always pulled the dispenser off the table.) I let him wear the dispenser, and he got a kick out of it and was able to use it independently. Pushing down on the dispenser will suction it to your table, yet the dispenser can be slid easily to another spot on the table. I was skeptical about this dispenser system, since it seemed a little gimmicky. I'd rather not focus on the dispenser when I'm in power wrapping mode, so I found this a negative.Neither of the two inch tape dispensers is an adequate replacement for my large weighted desk tape dispenser simply because sometimes two inches of tape just isn't enough. One dispenser goes around the wrist (the hand band) and you use leverage in that manner. Another dispenser sticks to the table (the deskgrip) so you get leverage when you pull. I appreciated how I could breeze right through what I was doing by attaching the dispenser to my wrist. I am still on the same dispenser after wrapping at least 10 presents in the last week. With this Scotch dispenser, no such action is necessary! As long as you do not mount the dispenser on the edge of a counter and bump it (thereby breaking the suction), it works well. I don't know what they did, but the new dispenser is comfortable and the tape is released easily from the holder, making for a quick, easy (and painless!) Additionally, this dispenser is not refillable. The dispenser is fine as long as you pull the tape straight up however, any movement other than straight up and the dispenser floats around your desk or tabletop like an air hockey puck. Personally I'd rather if the dispenser stayed put rather than float around. The second dispenser is the deskgrip one. found it slightly awkward, and quickly set it aside.Sticking the dispenser to a table worked better, but still. With this dispenser over my hand I always knew where the tape was! The desk/table dispenser's are great.

It holds the dispenser to the table top against upward pull (which is why you want to pull straight up when dispensing the next tape strip), but not against sideways movement.

Initially I put the dispenser on my right hand and found that taking the tape out was always awkward, as if it was backward or upside down.

When the dispenser is tugged upward (as in the motion of pulling out a strip of tape), the deskgrip creates some sort of suction that holds the dispenser tight to the desktop (or whatever smooth surface it's on); when not under the pressure of a tug, the suction releases and the dispenser can be moved around the desktop about as effortlessly as an air-hockey puck.
