I have three other printers and the quality of this one against the other three including one Epson is far superior. Epson printers also gets the paper stuck and it can be a pain to reset the printer back up to use. I like inkjet printers that have setups like that. That's what I love about my previous Epson printers also. I own several of the Epson Artisan printers. There are other printers out there that, in my opinion, do a much better job than this one for less money, so do some research before purchasing. We have three Epson printers in the family and we do like them. Needed some printers for the mini home office and this one works great. I found this to be far too long and cumbersome, as the three printers I had previously owned took no longer than 30 minutes to get set up.I am still unclear as to why the installation on my desktop was so difficult. Many modern printers have eight or nine cartridges, so I look at this as a plus. I currently own five printers, and go through them rather faster than most people, thanks to a cat who jumps on them. Like almost all printers now, the Epson is mostly plastic and thus easy to damage. These were my first two Epson printers and am very frustrated that both printers developed the same problem so early and disappointed that the 810 is no better than the 800 it replaced. Epson has managed to make dealing with printers slightly less tedious than before, and that is progress. We have owned other Epson printers that are larger and I like the compact size of this one.
