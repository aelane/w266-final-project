This is a lovely ink. The "Winter Persimmon, Deep Orange" ink by Namiki Iroshizuku is nothing short of spectacular. And as beautiful as the ink is, the bottle itself is also quite appealing. I enjoy the ink and find the color delightful as well. However, my quest for purple ink is far from over :(The Autumn Leaf red is absolutely beautiful. I love this ink!! I will use this ink from here on! Great ink. I think it looks very classy, and the ink dries beautifully and looks wonderful in hand written letters and notes.I would recommend this ink. This is my first Iroshizuku ink purchase, as I was not sure it would be worth the extra cost. I usually get Waterman's or Noodler's ink. This is not the only ink I use, but it is far and away the one that I use most often.One effect of getting this bottle of ink has been to make me a hard convert Pilot Iroshizuku ink. The ink flows smoothly with a Muji fountain pen and Clairefontaine paper. Seriously great ink for a fountain pen.

I believe these to be some of, if not, the best ink for that particular quality.

I LOVE this ink and the color is truly a world standard of blue.
