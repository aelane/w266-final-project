This printer works perfectly fine, as good as a Brother HL-2270D that I had bought a few years back, I had no issues setting it up for wireless printing even though the set-up process can be a bit challenge, to say the least. As a printer, out of the box, I'm highly pleased with this. This Ricoh printer is far from user friendly -- my Win7 system was unable to successfully install via USB, ethernet, or wifi. This printer simply will not work with any of my Macs. This printer will work great in most small to medium size office situations including home offices. as the printer is in a different room than where we usually use/work on our computers.At this point I essentially gave up, like many of the other reviewers. Overall , very good and competent printer. I was genuinely surprised to learn that a printer being manufactured in 2014 does not support Mac or Airplay. I'd love to review this printer, but I can't get it connected via wireless or by USB.
