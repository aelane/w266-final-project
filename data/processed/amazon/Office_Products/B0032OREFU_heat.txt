I tried the heat but I imagine that if it's cold enough that I want my feet warmed it's probably so cold that I wouldn't want to take my shoes and socks off. The low heat (125 watts) is noticeable and keeps the feet warm. The high heat (250 watts) is quite warm, so socks are needed. The heat blows through many slits and heats the feet and legs plus the area surrounding the sitting person.The unit is light weight (3 pounds) and has two height settings (5 and 6 inches) and three tilt angles (5, 14, and 20 degrees). I tested the heat settings briefly. I could not detect any heat in either position - probably because of poor air the air flow. The heat settings on the other hand are top notch! Nice heat, especially when she is feeling chilly.2. However, the heat function worked as indicated though it smelled for the first few hours (coated heating element?). The low heat is just where I'd like it in most cases.

It has two heat settings (the high one is too hot for bare feet but okay when I wear socks) and a cooling fan that simply blows air.

The heat and fan were just perks originally, but I have found that I rather like them and actually use them.

The heat has a high and low setting - the fan a single setting.
