The platform is pretty sturdy and has rubber strips on the underside to keep it from sliding around and it looks nice.Although it's really not adjustable. Flipping the platform around, with the feet attached to reverse from positive to negative, won't work either because the wrist pad is held in place by Velcro tape, so it doesn't slip when your wrists are resting on it. What I ended up using it more for however was a platform that I could use in bed when I was working on my netbook. Let's find out.PLATFORMThe platform is the only feature that separates this product from plain wrist rests. Unfortunately, if you want the platform on a negative tilt, you'll have to eyeball the rubber feet on your own; 3M forgot to include templates for negative tilt feet.WRIST RESTThe included wrist rest is very, very nice. I ended up just tossing the platform to the side and using the wrist rest by itself.CONCLUSIONMy experience with the 3M Tilt-Adjustable Gel Wrist Rest Platform was rather disappointing. I suggest you do just that and forget about the platform. I am using it withLogitech Wireless Combo MK260 with Keyboard and Mouse (920-002950)and both, the Rest platform and the long pad for wrist fits the keyboard very well. I may continue to use the platform but I believe I will go back to using my old, soft, nylon covered wristrest. The platform I received seems somewhat darker than the one pictured (that could just be lighting). Using this platform it's even more so. The platform is wide enough for a keyboard with a ten-key (mine doesn't have a ten-key) but not wide enough for the mouse and mouse pad. I also felt that it was overpriced for what basically is just a plastic platform with a gel wrist pad. The platform is tilt adjustable with a variety of settings. The platform also comes with a gel filled wrist pad and an antibacterial coating to keep germs away.
