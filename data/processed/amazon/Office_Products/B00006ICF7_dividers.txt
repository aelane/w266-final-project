These dividers have what are called view tabs instead of insertable or stick on labels. These dividers are super thick and durable, yet still flexible/bendable. I was pleasantly surprised by them!There are 8 dividers per set(along with a clear cover and a clear paper protector sheet). These dividers with tabs are of very nice quality. These transparent dividers are a perfect addition for those big binders students need for college classes. These transparent dividers come in a huge pack of five sets and each set contains eight tabs. The dividers are thick and strong but are still crystal clear. The dividers themselves are very sturdy, and not likely to tear out of the binders even with tons of use. Wilson Jones got dividers right:  the tabbed sheets are entirely made of plastic, thus making them much more durable and easier to grab onto and turn through a pile of pages. I'm picky about my dividers and I've always loathed the little paper tabs you have to jam into the colored divider tabs to act as labels. Very well made and sturdy, these are excellent dividers. I&#8217;m not entirely sure what I was expecting when I selected these tab dividers, but I was definitely pleasantly surprised. These are very nice, durable dividers and they are perfect for my purpose. So you could use the dividers for any purpose. I love that the dividers are grouped together, and I think having the one sheet at the back is an easier alternative to seeing my messy writing on the type of tabs you can write on, or the types of tabs you either have to type out or print out and insert or stick. The dividers I grew up with (soon after the invention of fire and the wheel) were thin manila paper with colored tabs adhered on the edge. These dividers are plastic: flexible, tough, lightweight. Sturdy and professional looking these dividers fit the bill for a gamut of uses. And, to label the dividers, I&#8217;ve written on them, pasted stickers on them, inserted folded card stock (that promptly fell out). These are the best designed and sturdiest  dividers I have seen. so these transparent dividers are a must-have at my home.
