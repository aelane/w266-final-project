I needed new markers, as the kid is always doodling on the calendar board, and our dry erase markers never seem to last, so I was eager to try out this new brand. So far, these markers seem to be lasting MUCH longer than the ones we usually use! These Quartet EnduraGlide Chisel Tip Dry-Erase markers are really nice in my opinion. I definitely recommend these markers. I've been using these markers for a few weeks in a classroom setting and so far, no problems. I would recommend these markers for classroom use. Looking for smooth markers? I like to be able to stick several markers together to make them more portable. Having used Expo markers for a lot of years I'm just pleased as punch to have tried these out. They don't smell as strong or caustic as the Expo markers. You can't lock these together like Expo markers, but they have see through design that lets you see how much ink is left. These markers are brighter and bolder than anything else I've used, so they live up to the promise. These markers do not show on a black dry erase board, which I did try. You need neon markers for that. These dry-erase markers have been just perfect. Depending on how quickly, and with what you try to erase the markers, you'll end up with minor streaking on the white board. The markers that everyone thought could make you high if you sniffed them. These handy markers will keep wet for up to a day! The markers have a clear barrel that allows users to see just how much ink is left. I've used Quartet dry-erase markers on the past. So, I wasn't sure what I'd get with these markers, but thought I'd try them out because they had multiple colors and the chisel tip, which I like. Dry Erase markers are one of those office/school staples. These markers will certainly do the job as similar priced markers. I love these erasable markers. These are terrific markers! However, it does not smudge or smear as many dry-erase markers do. We like these better than any dry-erase markers we've had before. I sent these markers to school with my kids to use on their personal dry erase boards. When these Quartet markers arrived the kids jumped out of their skin to compare and contrast them to the EXPO giant pack we have (COSTCO).Hands down the Quartet 12 pack won in the following categories we made up:Colors - more intense colors from Quartet; darker and deeperErase  - easier with Quartet (we use a dry microfiber cloth)Caps - easier to cap with Quartet the EXPO ones have a tendency to get mashed because of cap issuesSmell - Quartet had a slightly lighter smell; EXPO smells like a marker - not bad and really only when you put them against your nostril ;-)The kids ran their own blind tests against the colors all afternoon - which is brigher/nicer/better color wise? Some markers are kind of dry to start out but these are high color, good flow. These markers work great, and there is an assortment of colors. Most dry-erase markers make you feel like you will get a buzz after a while, but not these. These markers erased without leaving a trace. I've used these markers for a half dozen years or so now and keep going back to them. We tossed the other markers we had when we got these, because those sometimes &#34;erase&#34; rather than write if you don't hold them just right. I tend to buy several markers each year and have them scattered all over the room. The EXPO markers that last the longest also smell the worst. So, this has led me to try many other markers. These are bright, vibrant markers with an ink gauge like you'd find in a pen. I like these whiteboard markers. These markers work perfectly with my dry erase board. These markers are very nice, providing a thick bold look that is easy to read from a distance and has minimal fading. Still, I would say these markers are slightly better than average when compared to other products on the market. These markers are great to use. Our other markers were constantly rolling off the table onto the floor. These markers are nice bold colors. The markers are transparent so you can see how much ink is left. These markers do write smoothly on a dry erase board, but as another reviewer mentioned, they do seem to stain somewhat and be hard to erase. These markers have nice bold colors and so far are good. The markers are easy to hold and I love that you can see how much ink is left. These are my special markers and will be treated as such. These markers are darker, the tip doesn't dry up as quick, tip doesn't crumple up and get wider, aesthetically speaking nicer looking, and last longer than Expo. What can you really say about Dry-erase markers? If you don&#8217;t mind having to replace your markers more often, these markers are above average. and while other markers only last a week or so, these are still going wrong 2 weeks on! I've been trying these markers out in my class this quarter, and the students I both agree that these are a huge step up. * The markers glide more smoothly than any others I've tried -- it's like they have more of a wet feel than most dry erase markers -- but they don't smear easily, either. These are great dry-erase markers with more ink and more colors. It can become pretty noxious smelling the dry-erase markers in the confines of a restaurant with all of the other smells going on. They're markers. The markers are extremely &#34;wet&#34; feeling and glide amazingly on the board. I will definitely be purchasing more markers from EnduraGlide in the future. These Quartet markers are of a higher quality than the cheap-o markers that came with my white board. I'm very pleased with these markers. Sometimes the markers can become permanent on cheaper boards but we did not run across this. These markers come in a nice variety of bright, vibrant colors. These EnduraGlide markers do clean better without as much dust residue. If that doesn't bother you then you'll probably like these markers better. I have used these markers while teaching, and I find that most of them work well. It won't write.The markers have no discernible odor that I can tell. These Dry-Erase markers worked perfectly, and were very easy to wipe off without leaving behind any residue on my dry-erase boards. They do not smell unlike some markers which have strong odor when the cap is removed. Erasing the markers on the board is easy.I have not used these markers long enough to see how long they last on the whiteboard or how long the ink last. They seem to be really good markers. These markers are more economical than the regular brand we use. Unfortunately, they weren&#8217;t as bold as the markers we normally buy but they are good quality. I tried these markers on a dry erase board at least once a day for three weeks before I wrote this review.These four dry erase markers are very easy to use -- they require no shaking or prepping and as long a you store them horizontally they don't dry or gum up. These really are great markers.

Having erroneously read these to be markers for packaging and labeling I thought at first, &#34;oh, no.&#34;  But when I tested them and saw the brilliance of the color, the easiness of movement and that they don't dry out even if left for a day without their caps.

This means it cannot fall off on its own, with normal use.Overall, Quartet Enduraglide Dry Erase Markers are very good markers I am happy I took the time to try out and get to know.
