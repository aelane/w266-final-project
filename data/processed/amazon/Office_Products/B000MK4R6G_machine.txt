I have never used a machine like this before and I thought that the directions were not extremely clear. I think that the machine is great for teachers and schools. I wasn't quite prepared for just how big this machine was. This is a solid and well-made machine. Once you understand how it works it's very easy to use and is efficient.The machine punches cleanly. This would a good machine for a small company that needs to make multiple packets and avoid copy shop costs. The machine claims to punch 15 pages at a time. It helps a little if you have used a binding machine before, but shouldn't be too challenging for a first-time user.Overall this is a high-quality product that just couldn't be much easier to use. However, this machine isn't meant for high volume, and isn't built or priced as such. For a medium-duty machine, I think the Fellowes Pulsar 300 is an awesome product and I highly recommend it for small office and home office environments. Binding with this machine will provide an easy method of making your documents impressive and professional looking. This is a big, well-built machine! The machine shows no signs of wearing out and the completed projects look just as good as any Kinko's could do. I have found that it is a handy machine to have with my group of crafting supplies.
