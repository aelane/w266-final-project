The only problem is on the first 'stick' you probably shouldn't put paper document up there. No problem with the tabs, and they don't leave marks or anything.When dust particles reduce the stickiness, you can wash these to reuse them-something that doesn't work out very well with the putty.These squares do have quite a strong smell to them when you open the package, but I didn't notice it once the posters were hung, probably because they weren't so close to my nose anymore.I like these-they're perfect for hanging information posters at work, or artwork at home. No such problem with the Scotch tabs! Instead, my problem was removing the tabs when I wanted to change the photos. The problem with using double-stick tape for mounting photos and other flat items is that you have to get it right the first time. Well, there was a big problem. The only problem had was lifting the liner off of the sticky tab. This solves the problem by being just sticky enough. The only problem with washing the tab was that I was unable to discern which side was which (not sure that it matters) since I had a tendency to flip the tab during scrubbing. The problem with Funtack is that it stains the item being mounted, especially if it's made of paper, and often the wall itself. So far I have not had that problem.

I had no problem with the latter, but I never came close to the advertised loading.

The problem is that wire is not a flat surface, and you won't get a SQUARE inch of contact from a string of lights.

That would present a problem, however you could use these with hooks that have a flat base and then place the wire in the hooks.Another amazing adhesive from 3M (I am not affiliated with 3M however I am reviewing this product under the amazon vine program - see vine.amazon.com for details)
