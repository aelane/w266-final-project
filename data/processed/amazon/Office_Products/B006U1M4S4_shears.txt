I like these shears very much. If you want to use these shears in a sterile environment you are out of luck with the laminated handles. Other than that they are great shears. The shears cut cleanly. These shears make quick work of cutting through denim, leather, plastic and, of course, bandages. EMT shears are an accessory which are very handy to have on hand (I carry a pair everywhere) for a variety of reasons - they are great in emergencies, like cutting stuck seat belts in a flaming car, but also for more mundane tasks for normal scissors.They are better than regular scissors for many tasks because of the protected end which prevents stab issues from a sharp point, which makes them easier to carry safely.These are a nicely done version, good build quality, good handles, and they cut well. These 7&#34; Bandage shears have a very high quality construction and they have held up well through numerous uses. The shears are covered by a lifetime limited warranty. I was pleasantly surprised at how perfectly these tough shears can even tackle that challenge!So I ordered another pair for the first aid box and am keeping the original pair in our hay barn (it will cost $200 for another hay cutter so I am going to be using these shears for awhile).These shears feel comfortable in my hand and they really do make fast work of cutting fistfuls of hay into bit-sized pieces for our spoiled little sheep.I know that is a rather unconventional use - but if the PhysiciansCare First Aid Titanium Bonded Bandage Shears can slice through hay with ease, I am confident they can handle virtually any challenge (especially first-aid related). These shears are handy for all sorts of household uses besides removing bandages! That's where these shears work PERFECTLY - the offset handle allows you to keep your hands away from the sharp edges of plastic and they cut wonderfully.Overall, highly recommended whether you are using them as bandage shears or for some more creative purpose. I got these shears to put in an emergency kit I keep in the car but really wanted to try them out. These medical shears are better than expected. I really like these little shears.
