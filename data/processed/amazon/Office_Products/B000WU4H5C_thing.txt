One thing to keep in mind though is that it is not very flexible from side to side, so if you have a keyboard that does not have a straight lower edge it will not line up with it.The rest is coated with an antimicrobial product to keep germs and bacteria from growing on it. It's not just a padded thing covered in faux leather, but actually filled with a thick gel (think Dr. Sholl's shoe inserts) that is both soothing and easy on your hands and wrists. This thing is a little short, but it seems to relieve some of the pain. Another thing I liked about this product is the non-skid base. This thing provides no conformity to my hand nor is it 'gel like' at all. This thing doesn't make my wrist feel any better and I can see pain if I used it long term. One thing that stands out to me is that this doesn't have the mushy gel feeling that I get from the leading competetior's. The first thing I like about it is the fact that I am occasionally a bit of a klutz and am forever spilling stuff. Since the only thing about my office setup that had changed was this rest, it seemed the most likely culprit. The only thing I don't like is that the bottom of the rest, which is designed not to slip on the desk, seems to attract dust and crumbs like crazy. This thing just isn't spiky enough or able to do any kind of lasting damage to be in a sadomasochist's kit.
