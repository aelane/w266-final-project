I use a lot of tape.I also have a small child, so I have elf duties.Did I mention that I have rheumatoid arthritis and my hands are cranky beasts during gift wrapping season? If you do a lot of gift wrapping, or if use a lot of Scotch tape in general, this set will make your life a whole lot easier. So, I found that it crawled around a lot on my desk, sometimes even wasting product by binding the tape to itself in the process. There is a lot of refills as well so this set will last you a long time. This is a lot of tape -- 750 strips to be precise.You get two deskgrips. Like I said, a lot of tape.Altogether it's a clever, convenient package. It is certainly a lot cheaper per inch to use roll tape. If you wrap a lot of presents, or use tape often this will make your work much easier. When you have a lot of packing to do, then the Handband dispensers would be very useful also.I found the dispensers worked well but were surprisingly difficult to refill. But there is a lot of tape in it. It's also great if you're wrapping a lot of gifts and want to be quick and efficient. If you have a lot of gifts to wrap, you need to order this. I always have a lot of presents to wrap every December, so I was happy to try out the pop-up dispenser.
