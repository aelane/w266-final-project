When I say this notebook is good for adult users, I mean that I don't think the design lends itself as well for usage by younger users who may be a little rougher with squeezing it into a backpack or kind of tossing it around. I would have to tear out notebook papers and staple certain sections together.With the hybrid bindrbook, it's so easy to add and take away pages. This notebook is very versatile in that it contains two different styles of inserts as well as a three-ring binder setup. The notebook contains two folder inserts with pockets and three tabbed inserts with paper holding flaps. As a notebook, it it flexible, can open up all the way so that you can write in it without having cumbersome rings getting in the way, and is very lightweight. A notebook is more compact, a binder easier to open and close. This notebook / binder is close to perfect for my needs. When I found the Mead Five Star Flex notebook and binder, I thought it looked like something very suitable for them. It's also a notebook and a binder, you can fill and refill it with whatever type of paper you need/want. This behaves more like a notebook than a binder. I still prefer a spiral notebook though because the spirals are so much smaller against my wrist. If a spiral notebook and a three ring binder had a child, it would be this notebinderAs a teacher, I often have bits of paper and stuff that I need to quickly stuff somewhere, this binder provides lots of pockets for that purpose.

And a notebook fanatic.

To me, it's not as handy as a notebook, nor as good at holding papers as a binder.

This notebook is great - it has so many features in one notebook.
