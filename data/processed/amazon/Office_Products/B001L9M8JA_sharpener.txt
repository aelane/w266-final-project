The X-ACTO Work Pro is a decent sharpener, but its motor probably will not bowl you over. The sharpener starts automatically when you insert a pencil. In general, this sharpener does an adequate job. The sharpener works like most with relatively quiet function and gives a nice sharp point. This sharpener was a bit of a surprise to me. I use my sharpener so much I meld to it. This sharpener works like a charm and has preserved the integrity of my art supplies. But the X-ACTO sharpener would be handy when working at your desk and you can just lean over and sharpen it with only one hand. This sharpener doesn't say, but I'm certain it only has one sharpening barrel and not two.UPDATE: 4.30.14 - It upped and died about a month ago. My old electric Boston sharpener is almost 30 years old and still performs well. This sharpener came ready to use right out of the box.
