The spine has a dip in the cover which can help you pull out the spine label and change it easily when you need to. The spine is easier to insert because the rings are mounted to the back cover instead of to the middle of the binder. The spine sleeve on these binders gaps out a bit to make inserting a flimsy strip of paper very easy. spine binders. The Speedy Spine Binders do what they're supposed to: spine inserts slip easily into the plastic housing on the spine which, if you were doing a lot of that sort of thing, could wind up saving you time and aggravation. I have to admit that sometimes putting a spine label in and eventually removing it can be very difficult with some binders. I suspect this also creates a stronger spine, less prone to cracking, because there's less wear and tear.I appreciate the interior pockets; many binders lack this feature. Only at the spine, and underneath the white plastic there is a raised edge that runs along the inside of each long edge of the spine. The "speedy spine" just relates to having an option to print the spine for storing. The spine actually offers the bottom pocket as well because it's been constructed with the pocket as one piece. I personally am never as thrilled when a spine insert falls quickly into the spine but hope her thrill lasted longer than mine when the inserts fell out just as quickly. They definitely are easier to load, but what makes them easier to load is that the spine is a little looser. It shows spine inserts being loaded practically instantly. That's unfortunate, because I think this special spine is the reason these binders are pricier than most.But I still give this binder the full 5-stars for being simply good at what it is supposed to do: bind pages securely and have the qualities I mentioned above, indicating it may last a good long time. you can load the spine insert.
