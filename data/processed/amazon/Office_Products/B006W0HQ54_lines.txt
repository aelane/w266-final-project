I thought I could draw sharp lines, in a sort of fine tip kind of way.This aren't fine tip. As such, they make beautiful calligraphic lines, sweeping in gorgeous, delicious curves.The colors are ample enough in selection for the average non-artist, or inner child seeking expression. You can create both thick and thin lines. You can create fine lines, bold strikes, and shading. I just got these and am pleased with the fine lines I can do as well as being able to adjust the thickness just by varying the pressure. If you want thin lines, and fine details, this isn't the Sharpie style for you.Depending on how you wield it, you can get lines in a variety of thicknesses, all of which tend to fall on the medium-to-thick(er) scale. This is not for creating thin or fine lines or shapes. Like fine lines - you can do that too. But there's a trade-off.Fat lines mean hyper-saturation of ink in the paper, and depending on the paper, it could mean hyper-feathering. If you are adept at using the very tip, you will get micro thin lines, and a bit more pressure will give you wide strokes. This lets you draw really narrow lines or thicker ones just by changing the pressure or angle of your strokes.One of the first things I did with these markers was to paint the black markings on some of my 1/700 models that had just been too narrow for me to effectively draw with a model brush.
