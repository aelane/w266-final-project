I also have used the scanner which is great and fast. I've used the scanner quite a bit and again, the quality is quite high with it. The scanner part works great too!Very pleased after the customer service department came through for me! It is a fast scanner and does a great job. The scanner is above average. The scanner is quite good for documents, magazines and such but don't expect to scan books on it. The scanner functions integrate well with my computer and the process is easy to navigate. However, setting up the scanner was a different story. The scanner works great, both for scanning images to your computer or to make quick paper copies. In the past, I've needed a separate scanner from the printer due to all-in-one scanner limitations. The Epson WP-4530 features a basic scanner by default, where scans are completed with the press of a button and no settings to alter. The scanner tool includes settings for home, office, and professional users, each providing the same basic options. However, I have been unable to work the scanner from my computer, I keep getting a pop-up that says there is no connection and to follow the "Solving problems section" in the manual. The flatbed scanner works but is painfully slow.
