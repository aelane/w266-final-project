Also, you can actually write on the tabs with most pens - something that the Post-It version of this kind of product has problems with it.So, is it absolutely necessary? These are the best tabs I have tried, and I've tried a lot of tabs. I believe these tabs are one of the reasons why. They are nearly as good as the tabs I use in a 3-ring binder. The tabs are very thick, durable, and easy to write on with pen, or fine tip marker. They are MUCH better than usual tabs because these are much more durable and they truly can be repositioned. They have bright tabs that are easy to see, easy to place, easy to write on, and even marker ink doesn't smear on them. These tabs are just what I needed to mark recipes in my many cookbooks. These tabs are perfect. The tabs adhere easily and can be removed and repositioned, and I wrote the names of the recipes on the tabs. I have used the usual A-Z tabs for years, but I wanted to classify my recipes by whatever group, such as Christmas Cookies, Christmas Breads, Chinese, Mexican Dishes, etc. Anyway, the tabs are easy to stick on and you can see through the tabs so you won't have to worry about covering something up. These are colored divider-like tabs attached to a clear section that will be stuck to the book or paper. This tabs are way cool, they stick easily to your folders and documents, also books for further reference and esae to get to the papers you want fast.I used them to devide sections of a book and with the plastic cover envelopes for my kid's school portfolios.Great for organizing documents and files These little tabs are just what I've always wanted! (Avery NoteTabs #16293 - 2" x 1-1/2" - 40 tabs per package) These tabs are surprisingly sturdy, much better than paper post-it tabs for places where you want the tab to last and/or stand repeated use. They are the perfect tabs for my custom-made notebook dividers (a favorite picture in a sheet protector) and I've already found enough other uses that I'll have to buy more.These are very versatile tabs and recommended. These little tabs are perfect for marking all of those places without a mess. These are very nice tabs -- easy to use, easy to find, easy to flip, just the right kind of tab for marking pages in a book or notebook. These little tabs are perfect for organizing any binder! This is your solution.These tabs are the size of mid-size divider tabs and can be written on if desired. Other flimsy tabs don't measure up to the quality of these AVERY labels; I highly recommend them for all your organizational projects. You can now add tabs to ANYTHING, and they will come off if you want to change the place holder, without ruining the paper it's adhered to. I love these tabs. The tabs can be written on with pen or pencil (very nice for re-use, although a light smudge does remain). The tabs are easily removable (I have only been using them for a couple of weeks, so I don't know what removal after long-term use is). You can write on the tabs with pen, pencil or sharpie, as well as reposition them on the page or remove them with out destroying the page it was stuck to, or lifting the print that was on the page. These tabs are great! These little tabs have a ton of uses, tab pages when doing research, looking through reports or handbooks or budgets. These tabs are great and because they are removable, you can use them as bookmarks too. I love these tabs! I had some similar self-adhesive tabs, but they were entirely plastic (even the die-cut tab part) and so I couldn't write on them. These tabs are different: the entire NoteTab is a tough plastic, but the die-cut tab part is also laminated with a thick cardboard paper. So far, I've peeled off & repositioned one of the tabs over 20 times and it shows no sign of losing its adhesive, either. I have used many of Avery's tabs and office supplies and they always seem to be top quality and have so many different products for specific office/paperwork/organizational needs. These tabs are exactly what I needed to help me with a large recipe project, where I made notebooks with certain recipe categories, but needed to set off certain sections within the notebook. I often move tabs around as needed, so these have been perfect for that use. These tabs are great. These tabs are very helpful. That's ten extra Post-It tabs for significantly less money. Since most tabs will not be removed from books once set, the only big advantage of these Avery tabs is the ability to write directly on the tab. These tabs are perfect for flagging important folders. I purchased these tabs to help me with my small group bible study. These tabs are sturdy, are just sticky enough to stay in place, and are easy to write on. I have other Avery tabs I've been using for over a year, and moving almost daily, that still stick well. I just love these tabs. Both the tabs and the plastic area can be written upon; writing in pencil results in a clean erase. I think these note tabs hold onto the paper better than regular sticky notes. These tabs are very nice and heavy weight. I've used the tabs as permanent dividers, although they could be used in other ways. I absolutely love these tabs, which come in a pleasing array of shapes and sizes, from a small thumbtab to a half-page stretch, perfect for taking notes in a textbook. These are simply stick-on tabs so you can separate sections in a three-ring binder or similar document. These are nice, thick tabs, that seem fantastic for marking one's spot. These tabs come in a resealable bag, though I tossed the bag away anyway. The tabs have one side where you can write on. You can stick the tabs on and reposition them as much as you like. I really like how the tabs also have space to write small notes on. we got these tabs for my 7th grader instead of buying a whole bunch of dividers for her binder. These tabs are no exception - great packaging and nice colors. These tabs are quite thick and should easily last for a semester or a year - either in the same place or moved from page to page. I like these tabs. I'm using these tabs here also to mark some pages for quick reference. I use the permanent tabs more often. These tabs are so perfect for jotting notes to find sections of the book easily. I love these tabs! The tabs are very sturdy and are made of a medium weight plastic. I placed the tabs on notebook pages and it adhered quite nicely and made the pages easy to turn as I flipped through them. The tabs can be repositioned quite easily and still have a firm hold on whatever it is you are attaching it to. I love these tabs, I will use them for my cookbooks as flags for my favorite recipes, and I would definitely buy them again. )You might have seen similar tabs made by Post-it, called "Post-it flags" which are made of much less substantial material. That's actually a pretty valuable feature.These tabs do a fairly good job staying sticky enough to hold on to the page, even after being moved 10+ times. The tabs are also handy for flagging a glossary, appendix, or other often-referred to section of the book. I even like how the tabs are packaged in a cellphane bag, perfect for transporting and keeping the sticky parts from getting dirty. These tabs are best for semi-permanent use.Another good use for the tabs, which I haven't tried yet, would be marking recipes in a recipe book that you want to try or often use.For convenience, ease of use and re-usability, these NoteTabs are well worth having around. I've been using these tabs to create dividers in my textbooks and cookbooks.They are great and very useful when the pages of your books are not highlight or notetaking friendly.They come off easily in my most delicate textbooks without damaging the pages, so you can sell your book back at the end of the semester without a problem.Nice colors, great size, very useful.The price could be lower, however. They are also a little firmer throughout than most other tabs. The tabs stay on firmly, I can write in big enough letters that I don't need glasses to read the word, and they stick out far enough that I can spot the tabs even if the papers aren't all flush and some stick out. The tabs have a tendency to curl after a while, but it's expected with thin material. I use the narrow Post-It tabs to mark "interesting" pages of books that I want to refer to or show someone else.Avery has apparently decided to compete aggressively, with products the other guy doesn't offer, such as these NoteTabs. Well-constructed sticky tabs. The tabs are sturdy and stay stuck.

Avery makes even larger perforated tabs for those that need to make lengthy annotations, but these are ideal for jotting quick notes and categories on the tabs.

While  both post-it tabs or post-it notes provide less writing area to make notes, at least they provide some space.

@highlight

They are also less expensive and tend to have less adhesive to pull ink off of written text.These tabs did seem to have enough adhesive that they would pull ink off of some written text.
