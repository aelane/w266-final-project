They don't cost too much more than a lot of other options, and they are better boxes. I have a lot of stuff in my junk room - all sorts of odds and ends - and, I needed to organize it all. I've moved a lot in the last few years (and am moving again in about a month which is why I got these), so I know a few things about boxes. I think trying to buy a lot of these boxes for a real house move could get petty darn expensive, even when they are reusable. I've moved a lot in the past using boxes I begged from the corner grocery store, much to my regret.Their reusability is a big plus, too. If you move a lot or if you have use for boxes periodically (such as using them to hold holiday decorations) this is a truly great feature which saves you time and money! They hold a lot without getting too heavy to carry. If you are using a lot of boxes this can be a pain. I recently down-sized, and I have a lot of stuff I "rotate" based on the season. I have a lot of papers and books to be boxed up and got these sort of crossing my fingers that they'd actually be strong enough, though fearing that they would be flimsy.They're great! I have not yet tried filling a lot of weight in them but I would tape the bottom if I had to do that. It would be a lot cheaper to find boxes at your local grocery or retail store, but if you are more interested in ease than price, you won't be disappointed in these.Overall, I would recommend these boxes to anyone looking for any easier solution for packing down items or moving them to another location. I use them a lot (the same ones) to transport items as well as storage, and they have managed to hold up well. I felt a lot more confident about these boxes than any of the taped ones I used.Quite pleased overall. I can really store a lot of my items in the boxes and I don't have a problem lifting them. They seem to really withstand a lot of weight in them. It's a lot like moving!I ordered a bunch of Banker's boxes, but they didn't seem to make a dent in our collection. They are VERY large so I would not pack a lot of heavy items or you won't be able to pick the box up. They support a lot of weight, allowing you to stack several high without crushing or tipping.
