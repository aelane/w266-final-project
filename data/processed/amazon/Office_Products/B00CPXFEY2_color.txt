Love the purple color! The purple color is just bold enough to be fun but doesn't have a cutesy sheen that makes it a bit too-too for a grown-up. Beautiful white color that is very resistant to smudges of any sort. I really like the nice rich purple color of this binder. I really like the bright color of this binder as it makes it easy to keep track of and lets me have a little fun with decorating it. It has really held up so far and I love the purple color. Each color of folder represents a different item. Nevertheless, the color ups it a star in my review and I'm glad to  have it for my needed purpose. The purple color is nice and the edges are soft and don't slice through skin. The color is great and the plastic seems really sturdy. Love that this is my favorite color!!! Having it come in my favorite color of purple is a bonus!!!! and color! I really like the purple color and it is much stronger and better quality than if you looked for a purple ring binders at back-to-school sales. I like the color and it works fine but it does not look like a heavy duty binder to me but it is made of polypropylene.The binder has two inner pockets. Sometimes you just need a nice basic color like White or Black and these are nice options but I also have other Wilson Jones Heavy Duty Binders in some of the other colors and they are very nice, bright and bold.
