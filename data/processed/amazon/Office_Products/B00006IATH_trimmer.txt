It was hardly portable -- it weighed a lot.This Swingline trimmer is much lighter, with the surfaces made of plastic. If you only need a trimmer for occasional use, I'd recommend it. I was looking for a relatively inexpensive trimmer for our office and this unit has been great. I already own the same trimmer but in the 12-inch model. They're both the same except for the size.The trimmer is mostly plastic and feels lightweight, but it stays stable when cutting and is solidly built. I have a very expensive Martha Stewart trimmer which is a huge disappointment, difficult to line up and and the cuts are often slightly off, which drives me crazy. This trimmer far surpasses that one, for less than half the price. If you want to be able to pick up your trimmer and easily move it to another room, I highly recommend this.If you want a little more detail...Paper trimmers usually have heavy wooden bases, probably so that they won't slide around during use. However, because it's such a light trimmer, it's easy to pick up the entire trimmer with one hand and tilt it until I find the latch.All in all, this is really a great trimmer. So when I saw this trimmer I jumped at the chance to try it out.Its my new best friend and literally cuts my clipping time in half. The trimmer cuts with a crisp and solid feel to the swing arm action. This trimmer has eliminated the problem.

Unfortunately it's very hard to get them correct with this trimmer.

I was afraid I was wearing out my Westcott trimmer, cutting out an extended set of Cards Against Humanity cards, but this guillotine trimmer was simply not accurate enough for that or for some other projects I had.

In short, I am impressed by how very lightweight this trimmer is.
