The phones are comfortable to hold, look good, and are really easy to use and understand. This can be done from any of the phones or from the base unit. The Panasonic phones may cost a little more than other brands, but in our experience they are well worth it. I have had these phones for about a year now and they have not failed us. Set up for the phones was also easy to follow and very logical. The phones will also freeze up and go blank from time to time, a few moments on the charger will normally fix it but it is a hassle. I have used Panasonic for my phones for as long as I can remember, has to be going on 20 something years and I never had an issue with any of them.For what I paid and what I got, its a great deal. My older phones would keep on charging, thus overheating the battery and requiring me to replace them a lot.Some say it should be louder, but I think it's more than loud enough on some days, while not loud enough on others.

Although the KX-TG9344 is not perfect, it is the best of the phones I've looked at so far.It utilizes DECT 6.0, which is the latest technology for cordless phones and is supposed to have greater clarity and privacy without having interference issues like the older 2.4 GHz phones.

I purchased these phones after returning a set of Uniden cordless that I put up with for 2 years.

I would definitely recommend these phones to anyone who needs a quality multi-handset system for the home.
