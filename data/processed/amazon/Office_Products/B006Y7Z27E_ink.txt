The ink cartridges sure are small. The ink cartridges are extra-large capacity so they don't need to be changed as often, and single color replacements are possible (see more on that below too).CONS:First off, I had trouble even at Office Max finding paper for this beyond the sample pack. The ink is supposed to be instant drying, but I did notice on two-sided pages that it still felt like it would smudge, not that it did. After installing the ink cartridges, it was supposed to begin the priming process, but after about 15 minutes (during which I was prowling through the software and documentation) I checked the status, and it said that the cartridge types were not recognized. Otherwise, once you have run out of any ink color, all printing is disabled.>> Concern About Nozzles:I have avoided Epson printers for years, because of prior bad experience with constantly clogging nozzles. It also uses Epson ink (multi-cartridges) which lasts longer and is smudge, fade and water resistant.While this printer is great for everyday uses, due to its large size (not many people would have room for this beast of a printer) it is probably not a good purchase for the everyday person. I'm guessing that will save some ink, as well.I think it prints pretty quickly considering the price.So far, so good. The four ink carts were easily and quickly installed, following which the printer was supposed to go through its initial priming procedure. (Perhaps their ink and paper are of a poor quality.) Epson says that each ink cartridge will last through two reams of paper. This means that when you replace an ink cartridge, you are not replacing the ink head itself. Also, it takes individual ink cartridges, instead of the bulk, which I love.
