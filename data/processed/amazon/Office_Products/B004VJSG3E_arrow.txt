Point the arrow at the recipe, and stick. Now with the handy arrow shape and see through potential, I can easily point out what I need and do so without covering other needed information.Avery has a winner with this product. The removable adhesive makes it so easy to move the big arrow when ready to mark elsewhere. Plus the distinctive arrow shape calls attention to critical areas in documents. The arrow shape is frankly not very practical in terms of utility since there are just wasted areas that cannot be written on (but then it's transparent so it's not covering things up). Approximately the top 1/4 of the arrow as the sticky substance on them, and like other brands of  sticky notes, these stuck well enough not to worry about them, yet could be removed without any issues.I had red/pink ones, and bright yellow ones and both are really nice to work with, both stand out well and will help draw people's attention to them. I enjoy the arrow shape, the see-through feature, and the fact that they are removable. The arrow shape is "cute" and large enough to be distracting on a document where you want to point out a specific line or passage. So, if I see a yellow see-through arrow in a textbook, where should I focus my attention...under the arrow, or next to the arrow? The arrow shape is great for page to page turning, as the arrow can be set above the page. These arrow (or if you're a real-estate broker, little houses) stick well and are, as advertised, see-through. I point the arrow toward the chapter name or number and write summary notes, vocab reminders, questions, comments, etc. They are shaped like an arrow to direct your attention to a certain place, see-through so you don't have to remove to read text underneath, and made of a plastic-like material to withstand multiple uses. I really like the arrow shaped semi sheer fluorescent yellow & hot pink notes. The arrow shaped note measures a nice sized 2-3/4" X 2-3/4".As a crafter, I found these notes to be both practical, as well as economical, for marking patterns and notes! I can point the arrow to the current row of the pattern I am working on, and because it can be reused to mark a passage several times [simply peel it away and re-stick to a new area for several uses!] If the arrow was pointing to the side, the "tallest" part is @ 2 3/4 inches and 2 3/4 wide.

I think these sticky arrow notes were a great idea in theory, but poor in execution.

This giant arrow is annoying to write on (simply because of its shape), and I hate how most of my pens dry slowly (or never dry!)

The arrow points to the exact part you want to emphasize.
