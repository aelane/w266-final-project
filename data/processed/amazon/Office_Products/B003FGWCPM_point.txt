Naturally, a fine point of any marker is not all that great for a large classroom setting. They have a fine point, so you can use it in tight places like dry-erase calendars, and they're great for color-coding. Great, fine point markers. These are fine point so they are best for personal size dry-erase boards (calendars, todo lists, schools, etc). It erases easily, and writes with a fine point. I am fearful at some point I am going to get my pens confused when I quickly grab for one when I need it. I was surprised at how fine the point is. These are the fine point, the company also makes thicker markers. The fine point makes it easy to write clearly and the ink shows up very well on the white board.Where these markers fail for me is in the cleaning. They are fine point so if you are teaching in a large classroom and want to write large, thick letters on the board these are obviously not intended for this purpose. These do have a fine point, and they don't smell, but they are just too faint. I would not consider them a fine point. They resist to the point that you really need two hands to accomplish it. To my point, these need the rubber grip mentioned above to allow cap removal.Overall, I would not get the colored assortment of Bic.
