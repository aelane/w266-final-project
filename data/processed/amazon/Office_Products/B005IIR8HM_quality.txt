Print quality is good. The quality of text or color prints is on par with an inkjet printer. It duplexes effortlessly and I love the quality of the print. The quality of printed documents is excellent. However, the quality of photos is very average, even on glossy photo paper. And the quality of the prints themselves is excellent. Excellent quality and very fast for an inkjet. The resultant quality of the scans is good as well. I'm pleased with the clean quality of the resultant copies from any of these functions as well.Downside: As I mentioned, size may be an issue for some--but only it you have a very tight office space. Print quality is great. If I set high quality I had puddles of ink that literally ran over the page.Occasionally I find that normal print jobs appear blurry in places, almost as if you shook the printer while printing.Downgrading the stars again to 2, its a real disappointment. Print quality is good, but not perfect. The quality of the print is great, the fact that we aren't out of ink yet, as it seems previous models ran out after 2 or 3 uses, well that's wonderful. The quality is great for an inkjet - color printing seems to be better than my laser one. Scanning has superior quality and resolution to its images!Economical on ink, fast and easy to use, but still cannot connect it to my wireless network, so have to print using a $3 cord I had to buy on ebay, because printer did not come with the cord to connect it with computer. Print quality is excellent and the print absolutely doesn't smudge with a wet highlighter or damp fingertips.2.)
