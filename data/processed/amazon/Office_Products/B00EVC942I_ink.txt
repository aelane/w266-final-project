)It writes smoothly--rollerball ink and a fine tip. Finally, the ink is a nice deep black color and writes very easily. Great ink flow, nice finish...the bottom of the pen is just too small for normal size fingers, hard to get a grab on it.... The ink comes out fluid and smooth and writes in a precise, confident line.The only downside to this pen is that I have to pay special attention to it as I am worried about people walking away with it - it would be intentional because there is no way a person could walk away and not know it is in their hand. The ink is smooth writing, very nice. The ink flows beautifully. The ink is long lasting and after a month I still have plenty left, although the ink at the gel/writing surface is starting to gather a bit (requiring it be wiped off to avoid sloppy writing). That does make it quite easy to replace the ink when needed.The ink flows nicely, the pen isn't too heavy, and it's a great pen for the price.Really my only issue with it is the design. Pilot Namiki ink cartridges are not difficult to find and they are available at this time in  Black, Blue, Blue-Black, Red Green and Purple. It is not at all flexible for me and the ink flows better than in my Mont Blanc fountain pen with a gold medium nib. This includes not allowing the residual ink in a pen to dry out and being sure to sufficiently flush the pen when changing ink. The ink flows evenly so you get a good even distribution &#8211; no need for the old ink blotters.The pen has an excellent feel in your hand. The ink cartridge provided features an ink very similar in drying time and appearance to a rollerball. The ink goes on a bit wet and the steel nib is a bit flexible to allow you some control over your ink on the paper, but it does not have as much give as a gold or iridium nib will, I have found.This features a well-balanced feel in the hand. The ink flow is smooth, the pen has a nice, rich look and weight to it, and it seems quite sturdy. I have occasionally experienced uneven ink flow, though it wasn't a big deal.All in all, I think this makes a great gift for someone you don't know well:  business associate; boss; or client. And the ink quality is actually good enough that it doesn't cause major runs or smear.It works, it's kind of annoying to put together to get it to work the first time, and it's got a pretty design. The ink flows so freely that at first I thought it was gel ink instead of ballpoint.The pen arrived in a nice box, the sort you&#8217;d expect for jewelry. The ink flow is pretty standard, but when you're on the up side of a loop, can come out faster, creating a thicker line or thicker spot. The ink comes out smoothly for the most part, but every now and again it does "glop" up (for lack of a better word!) The ink is smooth and doesn't skip. The ink flow is very fluid and very smooth. But, the ink bleeds heavily on every medium I have used it with (everything from cheap notebook paper to high quality vellum to photo card stock). The ink however was smooth, and very even. The ink flows evenly and the pen glides across the paper. It's used to draw ink from a source. The first is that the ink is rather thick and needs a chance to dry before the paper comes in contact with anything (such as an envelope). I like that it is comfortable to hold and the ink flows smoothly. The ink flow is so smooth that I find myself rushing as I write because of my irrational thinking that the ink will glob if I slow down. Fast or slow, I've not had the ink glob or skip. The ink is clear and smooth-looking and it just feels substantial in my hand when writing. You'll also want to get a different ink than the default supplied - I found that the black ink was on the grayish side of black and actually bled quite a bit on note cards, creating some noticeable spider lines.The only other writing fountain pen I have is the Lami Safari (Fine point), and I would say that this Pilot writes more fluidly simply due to the fine vs medium point, but all-in-all, is very comparable in overall performance. The ink flows very well and evenly. The ink cartridge that also comes with the pen has ink that isn't as dark a black as I like for my artwork but is waterproof.

It could be the ink cartridge, or it could be that I press down rather lightly when I write.With all this in mind, I give a high four stars to this solid pen and state that it will be well-cared-for and not treated as an ordinary cheap pen.

Also, the ink dries rather quickly and seems like it's water-resistant.The pen comes in an attractive Pilot case which makes it nice if you want to give it as a gift or just to store the pen in.As another reviewer pointed out, there were no instructions enclosed for how to load the ink container into the pen, which was a little inconvenient to figure out.

It feels smooth and the ink flows nicely with no skipping or blotching.
