Next time I will just use FireFox, but I did not have any trouble printing my test tickets.Like others have said, good idea, but the Avery website should have prepared better to have all templates ready for this new product. Between the time, hassle and expense, larger batches make more sense to have printed up the traditional way...smaller batches are just too much trouble. These arrived at the perfect time and instead of me having to make my own tickets on standard paper I was able to create pretty nifty raffle tickets and print them out, made them look so much more professional!These work perfectly, easy to use and are high quality. Will definitely use again the next time I need something like this. So if you're comparing to having them printed, make sure you include your time in the comparison.But again, they worked great for me and were easy to use. I think the next time I go to make these tickets things will run much smoother. I've been a long time user of Avery products for many decades and have come to rely on the many products they offer in my day to day business and personal life.The Avery 16154 tickets are of very good quality and can become very useful for our needs. I'm not entirely sure that these were worth the time and trouble.

This time it's different.

Be prepared to spend a little time getting the tickets printed correctly, you will be pleased with the final results.

Just be aware that you may need some time to get the right template and fine tune your design before printing it out.
