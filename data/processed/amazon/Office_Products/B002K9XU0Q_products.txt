That comes out to .017 for the 3M Permanent Adhesive (3300-H) and .02 for the Post It Super Sticky (2100-H) of which I am relating the two because it is 3m and they are complement products. The "Super Sticky" products stick well and completely, yet they're easily removable when you wish; this is why I like them so much. I know this is true b/c Post-It products I purchased in CA just fell off when I went to NY during the summer. We have used other post-it products since a long time and it has been good so far. I look forward to trying more of these products soon. With products such as these, it all comes down to, is it sticky enough, too sticky, or the right size? With similar products, I had to wait quite a while for the ink to dry before applying the label. Since I've liked other Post-it products, I decided to give a try to these file folder labels, and so far, they are performing far better than the Avery alternative. How simple is that!I have reviewed a few Post-It products,and always wonder why 3M wants a review when it's 3M? What's not to like about 3M products? Their products are superbly designed and manufactured.
