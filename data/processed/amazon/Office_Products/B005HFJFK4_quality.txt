The quality is so high on the photos it makes little sense to shop around for higher print-out quality. -tested it, mind-blowing good, I'm a Photographer and the Print quality and color are phenomenal. The quality for the letter and the quality for the photos was excellent. Wish I had not done that, as the quality is so good I may have to toss the old scanner. The quality was as good as my stand a lone scanner and worked extremely fast.There is a 30 page document feeder which works as advertized. The Epson Artisan prints extremely nice quality photos. Handy, easy to use and of good quality. HP usually has the best built quality for heavy use. Print quality is great. Print quality is excellent, as is printing photos and now with the addition of the Epson Iprint app or even the paid 3rd party app Printershare you can print pictures and documents from your phone or tablet - too cool! Overall, I feel the quality and durability of the Epson printers, as well as the more stable drivers packages and ease of driver install, and the ability to print from smartphones and tablets makes Epson the clear choice for home printers. What astonished me was the quality of printing on photo paper. Printy quality is great. The quality of the scan was very good, and it is so quiet when it scans that I had to check a few times to reassure myself that it was running! Laser quality when printing text6. The quality of the print images is great.

Using decent quality paper, the output is sharp and clear.

The HP does feel like it is slightly higher quality only because the Epson paper tray seems and feels very plasticky if not flimsy.

Print quality seems to be excellent on both.
