Its a good mouse pad. It is easy to use and the mouse glides but doesn't slip around. I've worn out the mouse favorable coating on the the shelfe. The old mouse mouse was white. TheBelkin F8E089-BLK 8-by-9-Inch Mouse Pad (Black)is the first mouse pad I have purchased in a decade or so, and it is the only one I have ever had that actually worked well with optical mice. Occasionally, it will not track correctly, and I have to give the mouse an extra nudge, but so far this has been a rare occurrence. Weird smell coming off this mouse pad. It works well with my optical mouse. I bought this mouse pad to use in my home office. What can you say about a mouse pad. Otherwise, it's a mouse pad and works like a mouse pad should. This is a standard mouse pad. Recommend for your mouse. This mouse pad is thick and soft and fills the contours where a mouse will have trouble tracking.

It's just a basic black mouse pad; nothing more, nothing less.But... oh, the smell!

Some of the first mouse pads were actually made from manufacturer's scrap of the same neoprene foam backed with a thin sheet of nylon or Spandex that we find in Scuba and free-divewetsuits, and some of us made out own mouse pads from worn out or badly torn wetsuits.So what does this have to do with smelly mouse pads?That's easy: those old wetsuits stunk when new, but one hoped the atrocious smell would go away by the second or third dive.

I'm not going to suggest that you try this, but there are some of us who take our mouse pads and put them in the washing machine with older dark clothes.
