It comes with twelve pouches: five 8.9 x 11.4 inches, four 4.3 x 6.3 inches, and three 3.7 x 5.2 inches.It's simple to use. I strongly recommend buying extra pouches at the time you buy this laminator.When you feed it in what you want laminated, you have to get over the hump in the feed tray. I will be going to Staples for more pouches but I fully expect it to work also. No more wasting pouches because you only need to laminate something the size of an index card. Twelve laminating pouches in three different sizes are included with the machine and additional pouches are easy to obtain at a reasonable price. The pouches are easy to find in several stores and relatively inexpensive. I'd recommend getting pouches of the largest size that will fit the feeder, to avoid the frustration others have noted when using smaller pouches that don't want to feed through straight. I was surprised to find that the pouches are very reasonably priced. If you buy 100 pouches, which is the largest quantity you can buy, of the 8.9"x11.4" pouches, it will cost between $.16 or $.24 per pouch, for 101.46 square inches. Luckily, Amazon sells 100 large pouches for $16, which seems very reasonable to me.It works great and is highly recommended. It comes with 12 laminating pouches of various sizes. It would be great not to have to purchase more pouches right after you get the laminator. I am not sure where you buy additional pouches though.Also, the outside does get hot, so you may not want to use this around small children. Just be aware that the biggest pouches that Scotch has available for this are 8.5" x 14" so you won't be able to laminate anything bigger than that with this machine.The refills can get expensive but I've found that they are cheaper to buy on Amazon as opposed to someplace like wal-mart...maybe a craft store would be cheaper if you have one of their 40% off coupons, but I haven't checked yet.Overall, I have loved having a laminator at home and this one has done a great job so far, especially for this low price range.
