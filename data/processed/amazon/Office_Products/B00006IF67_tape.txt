What can one say about 3M Scotch tape that everyone does not already know. Magic tape is a good name for it though. This tape is good tape, seems to stick to my cat very well, but that's what he gets for nosing around in my office waste basket...  LOL  Good tape for a great price. They can be torn more easily than the shiny Scotch tape but are far better than off brand stuff. This is an awesome 10-pack of tape that means I won't have to buy tape again for probably six entire months. It's tape:  what more can you say? Magic tape is virtually invisible when applied. This Scotch tape refill roll fits myScotch Transparent Tape Dispenser DS520. I love this tape. I love having this tape around for mailing things, wrapping, or school projects. Scotch tape is tape.

This tape made by 3M Scotch is just about as magical as you're ever gonna get in the world of tape!

At first it appears to cost slightly more than another Scotch tape that is packaged very similarly to this; but that tape is 300 inches long and this tape is 1000 inches long.

A great tape!
