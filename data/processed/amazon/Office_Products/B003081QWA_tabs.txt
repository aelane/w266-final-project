The tabs are extra wide so you can actually fit your entire heading on it. I do wish it would go beyond only 5 or 8 tabs. The tabs are different because most dividers you either have to write on the tab itself or write on a little piece of paper that slides into the tab. If you need to change the tabs then it's easy just replace the page in the back. You can easily create and print your own tabs via Microsoft Word, and the title page holder keeps the titles in view. The tabs were great and easy to use. The tabs are extra wide so you have lots of room to write on. I really like the larger sized tabs because it makes it easier to go right to the section I'm looking for. No more trying to print tabs, just print a sheet and insert into the title page holder then all the tabs are marked. I like how large the tabs are as well, it really makes it easy to identify where the tab is and it doesn't get lost in the papers when the binder is open. The tabs are transparent too, but there's no way to put a card in to denote the subject. The tabs are on clear vinyl overlays through which you see your label on the bottom.I use a binder to store recipes that I've ripped out of magazines or the newspaper, and stick them in plastic sleeves. The tabs do the job, and are visually attractive. The large tabs grab your eyes and make it easy to identify each section. Also, the tabs stick out slightly from the side of a standard binder, which means they bend back when you put them upright on a shelf with the pages toward the back. These tabs are a good execution of a good concept (clear tabs with a printed back sheet that you generate on the computer based on a template). Finally, you can't use more than 5 tabs per binder. These are great tabs for separating out binders, and dividing up sections. There are 5 tabs for 5 categories or divisions. The tabs should always be visible with this set.These tabs are a bit different too in the sense that your titles for each tab isn't actually on each tab. The tabs are transparent so you are just reading the titles through the actual tab. Not only can you print out the Title Page for your tabs but you can also print out a Table of Contents that goes in the front of your binder behind the included protective cover.I find this to be a very durable set that you should be able to use over and over.

These aren&#8217;t your tabs that you buy in your local big box store, but rather tabs that will last a long time.

I do like the tabs showing past the papers I have loaded in transparent sheets which I use frequently.

And, yes, they do.They're also large, so the tabs stick out past sheet protectors, if you use those (which I do).
