The green color is a little bright for my taste, closer to lime than olive, but it does stand out well on a bookshelf or desktop. The Army Green color is basically a slightly brighter than drab version of olive drab and would make a nice color choice if you want to avoid the plain Jane options without going to neon land. Totally appealing color list to the younger crowd or those that just want a little more color in their home office supplies. The color is nice and unisex and I would consider this binder if I was to buy another one in the future. I even like the color although I wouldn't call it army green. It's very sturdy, and the green color was always easy to spot. This bold color stands out. The color is nice and won't attract dirt like a white binder. This color stands out. Though the green color is not my favorite, it certainly is well made. The color is very nice, bright and bold.
