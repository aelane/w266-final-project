So if you want a gel pad for the wrist, you could consider a separate one, which might cost quite a bit less.I don't ascribe any value to the "antimicrobial" claim, having never gotten sick from using my own keyboard or any other desk items. I have a gel mouse pad, so I'm used to the comfort of the gel wrist support.I think it'd be great for laptops, too. This 3M adjustable gel wrist rest platform helps alleviate some of the discomfort from the long hours spent at a keyboard. The gel pad wasn't cushy enough for me. The gel pad is nice and my palms rest on it nicely.They have two sets of plastic stick on legs so you can choose the right height. If not for reviewing another gel wrist product3M Gel Wrist Rest, Daisy Design (WR308DS), I would've found these things pointless. The soft gel is firm, but it's perfectly soft for comfort. They fall apart, the gel leaks out, and they get shiny with sweat in the areas over which the wrists rest. The 3M gel wrist rest is available for about half the current price here on Amazon (which I think is well worth it, I love my 3M gel wrist rest). Once the gel wrist support is adhered to the platform there will only be room enough for a standard, straight across keyboard. The gel wrist support does not really need to be pasted down to the platform, it can sit in front of it and will not slip or slide around.The best thing about this product is the gel wrist rest.
