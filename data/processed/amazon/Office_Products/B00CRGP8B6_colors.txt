We also liked the bright colors. Fun colors too! The bright colors are nice but that kind of a trivial matter. I love the bright colors, sort of a decorator touch. The colors are bright and crisp.I don't know what else to say except I like them. the colors are also pleasant to the eye. The colors are bright, and they make homework fun for the hesitant child! I like the colors of the pencils. I like the muted colors; I like the pencils.Paper Mate Mates 1.3mm Mechanical Pencils, 5 Yellow Barrel Mechanical Pencils (1862167) They like the colors, and they seem to hold them well with the triangular shaped barrels. The colors are bright, and the lead thickness is nice.
