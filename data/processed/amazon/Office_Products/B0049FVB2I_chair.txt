So, I settled on this mid-price chair on the positive reviews here alone, and figured that I could always send it back if it wasn't a good fit. The chair comes with all the hardware you will need, and also includes an Alan key for tightening bolts - for some people this will be important, as there's nothing worse than not having the right tool for your new toy!CONSTRUCTION/QUALITYI have only owned older or cheaper chairs, but I do have friends with high-end chairs, and I'm pleased to say that this one in particular is just about right for the price-point. The chair comes to a nice height at the back (I'm 5'9"), and you can lean it back and set it or allow free leaning with the use of the side lever. The chair has a decent range in terms of height, although if you're taller or have a tall desk, you might find that it doesn't go as high as you might want. I now have a comfortable, decently-made chair for less than a hundred dollars (at the time of this writing), and it has definitely improved my ability to work for longer stretches, allowing me to finish up a day's work more quickly! Overall, I can definitely recommend this chair as an excellent contender in this price range! After having the chair for several months, the seat padding has greatly decreased in effectiveness. Now granted, I use this chair for several hours every day so this may not apply to some people considering the chair, but nevertheless it is worth mentioning. It was only when we purchased a second chair for my wife that it became clear just how compressed the cushioning had become - you could actually feel the difference in height! I will be buying a chair cushion to alleviate this, so I still can recommend this chair, but perhaps with a little less enthusiasm. The chair has a side rock to it that make me think it will not hold up on the base for as long as I would like. Putting it together was simple for a chair. This is my second chair in a year. Just got this chair, assembled it, and found it seems pretty sturdy. Its a nice looking chair, comfortable cushion too.
