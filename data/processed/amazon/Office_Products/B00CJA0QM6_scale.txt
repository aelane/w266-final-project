This is really a great little scale. I have an old Weighmax scale and when I weighed items on both scales, the numbers matched consistently. The newer scale also gives the same weight time after time.The only drawbacks to the newer scale are the difficulties it presents for Mac users (hence only 4 stars) and perhaps its small surface and limit of 10 lb., though for many users the easy portability of the scale may be an advantage. The scale makes a very gentle beeping sound when displays the weight of an object.Overall, the scale is attractive, easy to use, easy to move around, and extremely accurate. This scale is fully portable, accurate, has a sufficiently large tray to handle large boxes, is sensitive enough to do small items, and can be used either on batteries or plugged into the wall. I like having a postal scale as it comes in handy. This scale is meant for envelopes sent by first class mail or very small packages. Basic scale with all of the basic options, sturdily built, compact so it does not take up a lot of desk space and the USB connection and software were easy to install and use. I use to have a very handy digital scale that went up to 35lbs but the cat knocked it to the concrete floor where it died. This scale can also be connected to your computer if you'd like to print your own labels. I love that you can easily hook up the scale to a computer and read the weight into an app. This scale has a fairly small foot print.

After finding the scale's software (not at the location in the manual, but it will get you there - look at the bottom left of the page) a window appeared on my Mac that faithfully shows what is on the scale itself, but that really isn't helpful.

This scale is a very good product.Compared it to three other small scales we have used: 1 digital, 1 USB only, and one mechanical.This is the best of all worlds.More convenient than the USB only or digital only scales because it combines both.Easier and more accurate than the old-time mechanical one.When you include* the larger screen,* ease of use,* battery adapter,* flip-up letter holder for easier viewing of LCD,* USB cable,* hold function,* grams or ounces...* this scale is great for us.Only negative may price (currently offered at amazon for $45.
