ETA of CLI-226 ink tank as promised and came in goodcondition without any problem. Great ink. I only use Canon ink in my Canon printer. Colored ink for your Canon printer that sucks ink like no tomorrow. Very good ink quality too. I use this ink for my Pixma MX882. This ink cartridge replacement package from Canon contains four "226" ink containers, for black, cyan, magenta and yellow. It does not have the large black "225" ink tank required by some Canon color printers. The ink catridges are easy to use; they snap in for use and snap out when done, and help produce brillant color documents and photos. This ink is for the MX892. Just wish the ink cartridge was bigger so it would run out of in so fast. Purchasing the ink in this set saves money and gets a pack of photo paper too. I always purchase my ink in the package. I wish this ink lasted longer, as it's very expensive. I don't know why Canon included a gray ink tank. I need the ink for my printer but I hate paying so much. I have always stuck with OEM ink, because the results and reliability are worth the extra cost to me (plus printer manufacturers are making it increasingly difficult to use non-OEM solutions).However, it is beyond dumb to see the combos that Canon is offering for the new line of ink jet cartridges. It's ink! I am going to try some generic ink to compare. Well its ink. This ink does a good job. Which ink isn't?Don't replace the cartridge until the print quality degrades. This ink is brand name canon quality ink that will last a while and print perfectly every time. This ink tank works in theCanon PIXMA MG6120 Wireless Inkjet Photo All-In-One Printer (4503B002). The ink doesn't run when it gets wet & the prints should last over 100 years. Apparently this ink is used instead of black for a lot of color printing which makes it quite expensive by comparison to the black. This is the last ink cartridge I bought for my Canon since I donated it to a charity. This is the correct ink for my cannon printer. I was really excited as ink at my local stores is really expensive and this is a great price. Canon makes some of the best ink cartridges on the market. This is a good ink cartridge, and it's easy to replace an old one.Not much more to say - ink pricing is an issue that's separate from this product. This gray ink is an improvement over the black and colored inks used in my previous Canon PIXMA. It's a Canon ink cartridge. I buy all of my ink from Amazon, as they really have great prices for them. Yes this is ink. Actually good ink too. The ink is actually a far more carefully engineered product than the printer. This ink is a must for anyone who owns the MG8220. The ink produces vivid and colorful pictures that are frame-worthy and on the right paper can stand up to wear and tear for a long time. I recommend this ink for anyone who's printer is still under warranty. they are the ink that goes into the printer, what can I say, they work. As we use the ink in a color printer we use to print patient pictures I'm not too worried about cost over quality.
