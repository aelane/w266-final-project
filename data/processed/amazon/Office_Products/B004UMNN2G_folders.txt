I have also found the hanging folders to be more durable than many of the ones I have purchased over the years. The folders are sturdy and conveniently reuseable. I use hanging folders in my file cabinets at home as well as in my office. The folders are well constructed.I also like the idea of the pull up identification tab. These are excellent, well made hanging folders. I don't color coordinate my folders, so the three colors, blue, red, and yellow aren't a selling point for me, as it appears to be for some others. These Pendaflex Ready Tab folders with their ingenious lift tabs let me reposition tabs on the fly, and better yet give me the option of double-tabbing, which means that the first folder of a section can serve double-duty, which conserves folders and saves space.The design of these folders is streamlined to remove the fussiness of removable pieces, which can be more time-consuming to use and more prone to wear or loss. These folders are sturdy and have stood up to several months of near-daily access/use thus far. Until now, I've been using house-brand folders purchased from Staples, Office Depot, etc. Those folders are usually not very durable, seem to lose their adhesive pretty quickly, have small tabs which get lost quite easily, and they usually come in just Green. These folders are quite a difference for me. My old folders would have already lost their adhesive by now. Arrrgh.These unique folders come with label tabs BUILT-IN! Yes, I used awesome and file folders in the same sentence!The multi-colors make further organization a snap and you can use and reuse these tabs countless times due to their unique position. These folders are like any other hanging folder you would buy, EXCEPT for the already attached tabs. Having multi-colored folders is great; however, having multi-colored labels would have been a nice feature to include with this particular product. Time will tell; however, since they are not plastic they might wear or get bent when flipping through folders in a cabinet loaded with files.I like that the tops of each folder near the label tabs is reinforced with an additional layer of approximately 1.4" clear material to keep the slots from tearing. The folders seem durable enough and don't have the rough feeling surface as many of the recycled folders on the market even though these are made in part (10%) of recycled material.If you don't like handwritten labels, you can print your own custom tab labels with the included template sheet. These hanging folders are of very good quality and fairly good width - you can comfortably put ~70-100 sheets of paper in them. I love these folders for that. But as I've added more folders, I've been able to change the tabs really easily. Including them on  multi-colored folders is also welcome, as I have come to rely on the variety of colors to provide quick finding of key files. So far these have been my favorite out of the hanging folders! These folders also come with a sheet of labels to be printed. This makes these folders more versatile and long lasting.I like that the tabs are paper and not those retarded plastic tabs with the little pieces of paper that always fall out. There are red, yellow and blue folders in the box if you need to color code. Hanging folders that have built-in expandable tabs certainly aren't a necessity, but it sure is an added convenience. These folders work great for my filing needs. These folders come 20 to a box; 10 red, 10 blue and 10 yellow. In the past we've always had the traditional folders were you had to attach a tab on the top, but they were always getting lost. These folders are sturdy and well made. The folders are thick and hold a good amount of paper in each one. These file folders solve those problems and make it super easy to change their labeling. If you use hanging folders for any purpose I would highly recommend these. These bright colored folders have a tab that pulls out so you never have to search for them.Another feature that makes them great is the printable labels that stick right on the tabs. I would recommend these folders to anyone!! I have not had my folders long enough to properly test this, but I feel confident they will hold up. They also come with 20 folders vs. only 18 Smead folders. These folders are nice but I find it difficult to offer some unique insight in a review.
