Similar to the Epson Workforce Pro WP-4530 I have, the Epson Workforce 845 Color Inkjet Wireless All-In-One (print, copy, fax, scan) is an excellent product that satisfies all of my needs.Everything about the product -- from its packaging through its many product features -- represents high quality. The print quality is like a laser or as close to a laser as an ink jet can get. Two print trays, vs one on the 635. I had to clean the print heads a couple of times at first (lots of ink wasted), but now it's fine.Buyer beware: there are no cheap 3rd party ink cartridges for this printer. After this initial print, it spits papers as fast as lighting.As far as ink goes, I haven't used up the inks that came with it. The print quality is great and pages print very fast. The two-sided print feature works well.Scanning is a breeze as well. However, Normal print on regular paper is disappointing with any photo or graphics, which is dull, and in my case, has a visible pixel line every inch. It is not that fast compared to the WF 600 that I just junked, in any print setting... disappointing, but not a deal breaker.Comes with 127 oversize cartridges, which is good and will last a couple of weeks until I can order some more.I have not tried the Fax. The print quality on text is great and when I print out Photos I am very happy with the quality on both B&W; and color photos.Another feature I'm really glad for is the Fax. It is not as tedious when it comes to two-sided print jobs as some of the units I've used. I click print and then later go find my products. The print quality is amazing, and the color quality looks great.The scanner on the Workforce 845 works great - I'm able to scan things to PDF without any issue and the quality is great. If you're going to have relatively low print volumes, then theEpson WorkForce 645 Wireless Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (C11CB86201)might be a better choice. I was never happy with the print quality with those devices, in terms of either the depth of color and the resolution of the color imagery -- or (most importantly, for most printing) in terms of the quality of plain old black text. Moreover, the print quality on plain-text documents rivaled that of my 7 year old laserjet (to the point that they are near indistinguishable), the photo print I ended up with isn't going to be confused with what you'd get if you took a shot from a high-end camera and had a professional printer produce an image for you -- but that's not what I was expecting from (a) my phone, and (b) an economical all-in-one printer. I love that I can double-side print without being there at the machine to flip over and properly orient the page. The print quality, when pages were placed side-by-side with pages printed out using my HP LaserJet black-only printer, I couldn't tell much difference between the two.The build quality is good; for someone who works from home or has a small business with only a couple employees using this printer, it should work fine.

Photo print resolution is excellent as well, producing frame-suitable prints.One of the really excellent features of this printer is the ability to connect wirelessly to a network, which makes setting up the printer anywhere very simple.

It has reasonable print speeds, the output is quality and the list of features is impressive.

The print quality was good, but not exceptional.
