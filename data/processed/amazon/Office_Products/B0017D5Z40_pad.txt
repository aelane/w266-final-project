The pad is textured, and allows mice to glide easy and smoothly for precision. The pad worked flawlessly with a red laser Dell optical mouse and a blue laser Microsoft mouse. The pad is an average size, thin, and lightweight. The pad is now on securely without movement. This little pad rules! This is useful if you have a laptop and want to take this "pad" with you as you can stick it to the surface of your laptop, and take it off and put it on a table when you want to use your wireless mouse. As soon as I deployed the 3M pad the pauses disappeared completely. To show you this pad's ridges I uploaded a high-magnification scan, with a dime for a sense of scale. And if that were too big, the pad is thin enough to be cropped with scissors or an exacto knife.Face it, optical mouses work pretty well these days, and you usually don't need a pad. After using the 3M Precise Optical Mousing Surface pad there is only one negative and the reason for 4 stars. I absolutely reccommend the 3M Precise Optical Mouse pad.

I am happy to say, though, that I have moved the pad all over and haven't had any residue or problems getting it to stick down.I can't comment on the claim that this mouse pad will make your mouse batteries last longer because I don't have a wireless mouse.I only have one negative statement about this mouse pad.

The pad sticks whereever you want it and stays as long as you want it there - and then comes off when you want to move it, without leaving any residue.

There is no "pad" involved.
