That's the funny thing about 3M products--you never know when they'll come in handy!I think they would work great for many things! The only thing to be careful of is the surface you stick it on and the fragility of the item you are sticking up. The only thing that would make these tabs better is if Scotch could somehow make them capable of holding a higher weight. The great thing about these is that they stick well on paper, the refrigerator, or flat metal and plastic surfaces. One thing of note: my walls are painted with an eggshell finish - I know that some have had issues with flat paint on walls. Best thing these little tape strips are for is holding things in place inside greeting cards. The one thing I liked is that even thought he tabs come pre-cut, they are not completely cut so you can actually customize them to the size you may need.The tabs are friendlier with certain surfaces, but I did try using them on a wall and found that they may stick aggressively to it; as a result, if you want to remove the item (in my case a picture) you need to do it with caution so it is not damaged or bent. I mean they are fan's of one thing or the other on a weekly basis and that could lead to a very messy sheet rock wall.

It turned out to be the easiest thing in the world to do: the print stuck firmly and snugly to the wall, and when I tried to remove it I had no problem detaching the tags from it or from the wall.

Same thing happened with these and they held!

Now these do the same thing without the worry of stains.Definitely not the best option for use with paper.
