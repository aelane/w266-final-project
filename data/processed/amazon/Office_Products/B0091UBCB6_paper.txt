The paper seems to load fine and I have yet to have any issues with paper jamming. So it is easier for me to remove the paper from the main tray and replace it with whatever "special" paper stock I need rather than pull out the printer.Performance-wise. You can use the multiple paper feed to either copy or scan your documents, and it works without any problems or jams. The paper tray holds more than my old Canon. It shoots paper out with speed, prints clear, quality pictures and documents, scans, copies and faxes, it prints from your smart phone.....who could ask for more?I followed the quick setup guide, plugged it in, inserted the CD and it led me through, step by step, holding my hand through the entire process. The paper literally shot out! And Epson includes a paper manual, which to me shows a quality company who doesn't skimp.The best feature for me is the angle of the touch pad. But truthfully, I haven't had paper jams with a WorkForce printer, so I'm quite pleased with this printer after several weeks of use!Scanning was easy and is wireless. Especially loading paper from the top section, everything was easy to do.Can I think of anything negative? Grabs paper easy and had no issues at all. You can print not only on paper but envelopes, labels, and card stock.I really like the Epson WorkForce WF- 3520 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer - it does everything well. I replaced it with our Epson paper and printed a few complex pages from Illustrator -- BOOM! You can also save paper since the WF-3520 can print on both sides of the paper. Nevertheless, with a large-capacity paper tray, reloading times are put at a minimum thereby maximizing your printing speed.Set-up: Setting up the printer from unboxing to wired connection via USB cable took less than 10 minutes. First, the paper tray holds a lot more paper than most, and it holds the paper INSIDE the bottom of the body of the printer instead of sticking out the front. Second, I've only had one paper jam (a piece of paper was bent in the corner), and this printer is VERY easy to unjam. It tells me to fix a paper jam that isn't really there. I don't know if it's a paper issue with the jam or I'm not putting it down hard enough in the rear unit. I used some HP photo paper, and the photo quality was amazing, much better than my 4 year old Epson printer.The printer's small screen layout is relatively easy to use if you are accustomed to small screen display layouts on home PC printers. The paper tray holds a healthy stack of paper, which is good since the printer is on the other side of the room, so I don't have to keep adding paper every time I want to print because of a small paper capacity. The paper loads basically flat.

From a good-sized paper tray to a touch-sensitive panel, this printer is both functional and beautiful at the same time.

You'll see the paper come a quarter of the way out before being sucked back in.

I don't find the secondary paper tray useful, as it is in the rear and I keep the printer on a desk which has a shelf/wall, so I cannot get to the back without moving the printer.
