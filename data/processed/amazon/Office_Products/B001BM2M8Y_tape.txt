I really like this tape dispenser. It is, indeed, much easier to hold and manipulate than most are, easy to load, feeds the tape smoothly, and prevents the tape from looping back and becoming stuck to itself. The tape is also sized to the dispenser, so I wasn't able to refill it with another roll I already had. The tape stays ready for the next box, instead of needing to spend a few minutes looking for the tape ends to start peeling. Nice handle that gives you control over the tape with one hand while you hold your box in the other. Since the tape does not necessarily flow easily out of the dispenser (there are odd plastic "teeth" that catch the tape), you need to use one hand to catch the tape and apply it to the package, as the other hand is pulling on the dispenser to stretch the tape over the rest of the package. *The tape easily splits and tears, depsite its thickness. I was really excited about this tape dispenser because I have problems with my hands. This is a very attractive tape dispenser. Even if you press the tape sticky side down, hard on the surface, the base plastic strip that would hold it to the surface doesn't do the job. So you have to pull some tape out, manually press that section onto the box, and then use it to dispense tape.The second problem is that it doesn't take standard in the industry, bought by the case tape rolls. Using packing tape becomes doubly challenging when taping boxes, especially if the box is not brand new or you may have just overpacked it a bit and have to pull the top flaps taunt. First it doesn't hold that much tape. Next, it's not easy to switch out the tape and the last thing is that you have to buy Scotch's overpriced tape since other brand's don't fit this. I think that this tape dispenser is a fantastic idea and it works quite well. When I use packing tape without a dispenser, it always ends up sticking and trying to find the line where it starts and getting it started is such a chore. But with the Scotch tape dispenser, I don't think I'll be having that problem. The tape is enclosed within the dispenser housing which keeps it out of harms way in between usages.The top will open back to permit access to the tape roll when the dispenser needs a new roll.If you do a little or a lot of shipping boxes, the dispenser will do a good job for you. When I am not using it I press the 1/2" of tape that sticks out to the dispenser to keep that clean and it is easy enough to peel away when I need to use it again.Over all I am happy with this dispenser though if I were to drop it on a hard floor I don't have confidence the plastic cover would not crack. The tape application is easy and consistent, and doesn't jam up in the process.And, enough tape "sticks out" after you cut it to make your next application very easy.The only way I could improve this product is to make an optional flap that covers up the tape that sticks out when you're storing the product. This is probably the most convenient and practical tape dispenser that I have ever used. This means you're going to pay more for the tape, and you're going to be changing it more. The tape never gets stuck on the corners and smoothly adheres to cardboard with a tight bond so makes it perfect for shipping. The tape always ended up folding over onto the dispenser and then I would have to fiddle with it to peel it off again. If you use packing tape so infrequently that you cannot remember where you put it and often end up buying a brand new roll when you need one, you are better off with something like this:Scotch Sure Start Shipping Packaging Tape with Dispenser, 2 Inches x 800 Inches (145).If you use packing tape every single day, you are better off with something like this:3M Scotch Gray Box Sealing Tape Dispenser (H180).The DP-1000 is for packing tape users somewhere in between. This handy little tape machine by SCOTCH makes packing a snap. You have to take the tape with your hand and put it down on the box yourself. Watch out for extra tape. Easy to load new tape as well. It efficiently cuts the tape with a simple twist of the wrist and you will never waste tape again because it can not roll up and stick to itself. It felt "cheap" compared to the hefty tape dispenser we typically keep around the house (industrial sized thanks to my spouse). The tape dispenser is blue and white (blue is my favorite color). The tape adheres fast and tightly and will not peel off easily. This tape dispenser is very easy to use and much more compact than others that I have used. This tape dispenser is a great little tool. The tape compartment is completely encased by a tough, molded plastic, so there's little chance the spool is going to dislodge, slip out, or get twisted around. This tape dispenser works fine but it is rather bulky. The tape isn't designed to tear easily, like duct tape. You can then slide a new tape roll on, start the tape rolling and close up and seal the unit. Applying the tape to the box is fairly straight forward and easy. Start applying the tape while putting a little pressure on the handle and it will roll out straight and true. Much easier to use than most packing tape dispensers, and feels comfortable in your hand. And, I love that the tape stays completely covered and that the bitter end of the tape never falls back on the roll, disappearing, never to be seen again. I then always smooth the tape down by hand for a sturdy seal. I use a tape dispenser often enough to have a standard one nearby in the linen closet. The tape snaps off quickly and cleanly.So what more could you want? The tape that came with the dispenser isn't huge, and it doesn't look like it could hold traditional tape that is easily available practically everywhere.If the price of the refills come down, and IF you can find them, I'd definitely say go for this, particularly if you do a lot of shipping and packing. The tape is easy to load (well, easier than your standard tape gun) and very light. Cutting the tape after application is a little harder than with a heavy duty dispenser as well, but once you get the wrist motion down it isn't bad.The Easy-Grip dispenser is a decent product for it's intended use. It kept not rolling, or cutting the tape prematurely when used vertically.In addition, the large rolls of packaging tape will not fit in this dispenser, you will have to by the specially sized scotch rolls (thus assuring further sales for them) if you plan to use the dispenser more than once. This smaller tape roll also runs out of tape sooner, thus more rolls that need to be purchased.I've used other, more industrial type rollers for packaging tape and they've worked significantly better than this. It is comfortable, easy to load and use, and the tape remains interior to the device when not in use (no sticking to everything else). The tape is not really strong enough for heavy-duty boxes but for home office use it should more than meet most requirements. But all in all, I love this tape dispenser, and feel it's worth it to look in the store for the smaller sized tape in order to continue to utilize it. I really like this tape dispenser. It is easy to dispense and cut the tape and it grips the inside of the roll and requires just the right amount of tension so that the tape doesn't come out too fast. The tape doesn't roll back onto itself, and the roll of tape stays put. Changing out the tape is also very easy. The tape moves well and cuts easily with the blade. I have used tape dispensers a lot at work and most are heavy and sometimes unwieldy. That limits you to clear tape and not brown package tape, the stronger fibered tape or weather resistant tape. It doesn't always cut straight, and the tape doesn't always grab the package or envelope upon first try. This tape dispenser is not designed to use for high production type of packing so don't expect it to do the same kind of job as the larger metal type that you see packing companies use.This is designed for home use. Since this is based on the tape that come with the dispenser I am going to assume that there may be a compatibility problem, but if perfection isn't what you are looking and a few bubbles don't matter, then I would by all means suggest this product.Easy to load replacement tape and over all very good grip and durability. When I think of packing tape dispensers, the iconic image is that big red menace with a serrated edge of doom. Also, the tape is fully enclosed, as you can see from the image. Cutting the tape is easy with one quick flip of the wrist.The width of the tape is fine for my packages. The tape roll is quite easy to replace as it needs just a little push on the buttons and the top will flip up for an easy access. * The tape end does not easily roll back on to the roll and get lost. I do this to stretch the tape tight on the package to pull flaps together. You can tension the tape and you can use the less expensive per foot large core refills. It dispenses tape really well even with the clip broken. The Scotch Easy-Grip Tape Dispenser works better than any tape packaging tape dispenser I have used before. Usually, tape dispensers are loud. The tape that comes with this dispenser is much quieter than typical tape.This dispenser is mostly for infrequent packagers since the rolls are short. This is a good tape dispenser for those of use that only seal packages occasionally. This is a fine tape dispenser. The tape cuts smoothly and with no effort. The tape does not get tangled and most importantly, it does not turn into a bunch of little slivers of tape stuck that you are left using your fingernails trying to dig off with little success. I got this tape dispenser to be used as an office tool that is sometimes needed when packing/shipping items. With the tape roll being enclosed in a plastic chamber, the noise you get from rolling out tape quickly is quieted in a muffled way, which I like because most dispensers have the roll fully exposed and they are LOUD!! While the tape being enclosed is a plus for noise control, it can be a hassle if you lose the unrolled tip into the dispenser because you have to disassemble it to restart the end. A tape gun that doesn't way a ton, won't take up a whole lot of space in a drawer, and won't stick to everything in the drawer because of exposed tape! The tape roll simply pops in for easy changing. I love it!This tape gun, er, I mean "dispenser," is nice and light, and works just like you would expect any tape gun to work, only better. You can put this fully loaded tape "dispenser" in a drawer and not have to worry about tape sticking to everything else in the drawer. They still cut through the tape just fine, even though the tape used is thicker than a normal tape gun's tape.I can't find anything to complain about with this tape dispenser. Just pull the tape across the box and give it a little twist to tear it off. Very simple.I searched Amazon for tape replacement and found lots of options for the 1.88 inch width. I also noticed that the tape we bought at one of the big office supplies is also 1.88 inches wide. The industrial tape dispenser has a big sharp edge to cut the tape and, while it works very well, is dangerous to have around the house. This tape dispense has a nice, streamlined design, but it's still not quite perfect. The tape still sticks where it shouldn't, and I don't really see how simply rounding the edges constitutes a giant leap forward. Those old heavy tape dispensers take a beating, and I wouldn't be surprised if this couldn't even take a few drops. My tape dispenser fell from about hip level to a vinyl floor, shattered the blue portion. We have all seen tape dispensers...especially the shipping tape kind. Replacing the tape is very simple. Not that packing tape is so hard to work with or anything, but if you have lots of boxes, this does simplify your job. I've tried other tape dispensers and I don't really have any complaints with them, but this one is particularly easy to load, feels well balanced in your hand, and is overall easy to use. I like that the tape is totally covered--that's a nice touch.
