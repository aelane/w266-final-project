I love the pastel colors on these notes. The pastel colors are...well they are okay...but guys don't really care about stuff like that. I like the pastel colors a lot. The pastel colors in this 75-sheet cube are cheerful and refreshing. I'd be lost without them!I like the recycled pastel post-its as the color is light, but have a saturated  color and they are not super sticky. And I really like the pastel colors, as opposed to the standard yellow. I do however like the pastel colors. I prefer these pastel colored, recycled Post-its.

They are in three pleasing pastel colors; no problem with reading notes written in normal ink colors.

I prefer the pastel shades to the bright, dark regular variety.

The pastel colors are muted, but are still bright enough to stick out if you have a note attached to another piece of paper.This size is also great for taking more notes and jotting down more ideas than the smaller sizes.
