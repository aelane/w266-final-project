Once I had the chair adjusted to my liking, I could sit comfortably for a full day without fatigue or sore spots. I can swing and roll about and this chair is like an dextension of my body -- very nice -- almost intuitive, but it does not go and get coffee -- I still have to get up and do that.Update February '12 -- still very nice, like new, makes me happy. GOOD chair. The chair itself is VERY heavy, which is something I found impressive. You can feel right away that this is a well-made chair; not one that is going to fall apart easy. I will say that the chair is far too upright without the recline, so you do have to constantly push yourself into the mesh back (which isn't too difficult, and can be done rather thoughtlessly, and the mesh is rather comfortable as well. This is a fantastic chair made by HON. Sitting in this chair feels like sitting in a Mercedes Benz E350 compared to my old chair which feels like sitting in a Toyota Corolla. The chair is plush and quite comfortable. I highly recommend this chair. The chair is well made and very solid. It is a very comfortable chair, but it is not "cushy". It is not padded like a larger cushioned chair would be. This chair is solely made for the workforce, so if you're looking for a super cushy, plush chair for your home office, this may not be what you need.But this is a very sturdy work chair. The chair can move up and down, the lumbar support curve can move up and down, the arm rests can move up and down and also out, in case you are built to need a more generous width to your chair.My partner, who is 6'5" and 180 lbs, and never finds chairs that fit him properly, sat down and said OOOOHHHH!!! But it is perfectly safe, as the chair is balanced for that kind of use. This chair is a great fit for home or office. "The chair arrives in a rather large box. What I did was tip the chair on its side and push the stem into the socket. Then I carefully lifted the chair upright (which was easier because I tilted it up rather than having to straight arm lift it up.) I really think this is a very attractive and comfy chair. This chair looks even better in person than it does online. I love, this chair, it fits me perfect and I am just under 6 foot tall.I highly recommend this chair...you can make it fit You and not you trying to fit it. I wish I could give this chair more than 5 stars. This chair, amazingly, is actually comfortable for me. It is also an attractive chair. It just looks good.This chair is very very comfortable to sit in. This is a great chair. As I sit in this chair writing this review, I am very comfortable because I can finally lean back at an angle that is comfortable for my back. I love that this chair has a knob that will permanently (until you adjust it again) adjust the lean of the back of the chair. But for those of you who can, I think this is a very comfortable chair with a hopefully durable seat. We found this chair a great addition to our study area for our family.It's fairly lightweight, and assembles within five minutes- pop on the rollers, place in the piston, put the chair on. The chair rolls on hard plastic rollers quietly- full swivel, solid cushion, lumbar support, nice design.All of us, from ages 5 and up, find it relaxing to use and sit in. But I am also in and out of my chair a zillion times a day, running from one nurses station to the next, and to the doctor's office, or a patients room, etc., and so I am constantly getting up and down from my chair/desk all day long. This chair is absolute comfort. This chair looks a bit pricey on paper, but I'm absolutely thrilled with the comfort and support it brings.This chair came packed poorly in one big box. Nevertheless, my chair arrived in perfect condition. The HON Ignition chair settles down perfectly in the middle of those issues.HON quality is absolutely great. This chair is pretty stylish for a mesh chair. Very smooth!I could not be happier with the HON Ignition chair... I work in corporate America and we use this same exact chair. First of all, this chair came mostly assembled. Overall, this chair will be a better fit.As a man who is above average in height, I had no problems adjusting this chair quickly and easily to suit my frame.

The chair swivels a full 360 degrees.

I am sitting in the chair now luxuriating in the comfort of the lumbar support and the fact that the seat is the correct depth for the length of my legs.

The chair also allows you to adjust the resistance for the tilt of the seat, as well as allowing you to lock the seat at a certain inclination.
