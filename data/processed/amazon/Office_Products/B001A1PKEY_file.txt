I am really impressed with this file system. The file folders inside are removable, impressive. I've used a few vertical file folders, not because I use a backpack, but because I like to be able to see the tops of the page of my docs in order to see the header, title, etc. I used to carry several file folders with the &#34;things to take care&#34; paperwork within. A very versatile and sturdy file  folder. i wanted to like this file folder. it's oddly shaped from any other file folder i've used with the huge flap and the opening at the short side instead of the longer side. With this vertical file folder I simply lift up the flap and find the paper I need, which much less fuss.And that's brilliant.Much easier access, it takes up less room than the binder, and it serves the exact same purpose. I can pull out the file with the parts I need and they all stay together. Not only is the Wilson file vertical, but the folders can be taken out of the folder. But I don't always want to have the entire file with me.

The file expands quite a bit wider than anticipated.

This vertical file organizer has manila files inserted into it sideways.

The file is nice and sturdy, so is the cord that attaches at the bottom, unlike cheap-os that seem to fall apart.I plan to use this to pieces&#8230; glad to know Amazon carries them.
