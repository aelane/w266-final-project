I have been using them to mark the pages in books that I would like to refer back to frequently (family trees and maps) and as bookmarks. Sure beats dog-eared pages with post-it notes! They are repositionable on all the pages I have tried them on.As an added bonus, there is a Box Tops for Education coupon on the package to support your school! However, it does pull some ink off of printed pages when removing sometimes.They make extremely good book dividers for thick books like computer reference books. Very useful and appropriate for marking key pages in a book. You can flag pages on books or documents. They are perfect for marking pages in a book without doing any damage to the paper. The Note Tabs are great for me to tag pages and make notes on the tab without having to mark up the actual book pages. They do not damage the pages to which they are affixed, and they are large enough to write info on, but not too large. They are perfect for marking pages in a book without damaging the pages or coming loose before you want them too.

I am able to quickly mark pages, then remove the tabs and place them on another sheet if a page is updated, without tearing the page.

They stick to the pages of my books without any problems, and they stay put.

You can use them to turn pages "like a divider," which is especially useful for marking/indexing favorite recipes in a cookbook or other kind of book where you can't just add a divider page and call it a job done.
