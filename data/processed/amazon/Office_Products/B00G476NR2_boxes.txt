I was also concerned about stacking fully loaded boxes, and they survived that also. The empty boxes are slightly lighter than plastic file crates. You receive four unassembled boxes and four unassembled lids, which are easy to put together with a few folds and tucks. I've had other boxes that include a plastic sleeve for this channel but these don't, though that doesn't particularly hurt the box's utility.This is a sturdy, compact and useful container if you have papers to store, but there are many other situations where it might be useful. these boxes come packed flat, but all you have to do is just squeeze them into a square and fold down 4 flaps until they snap into place. These boxes are sturdy and just the right size to store archived files. The boxes are sturdy, easy to put together and are the perfect size for files. The boxes are easy to label. The boxes in which I've been storing and using hanging file folders aren't designed with lowered sides, so they haven't been the most satisfactory. I'd recommend these attractive boxes for storage with occasional file movement. I'm not expecting these boxes to last forever, but for now they are fine and I can recommend them for cases where hanging folders are needed. These boxes were a breeze to put together, no extra tools or tape needed. These boxes are sturdier than one might think and stacknicely. I got these boxes to store old tax files and old financial documents that are taking up too much space in my large filing cabinets and I'm very pleased with them! I love how sturdy  and well made these boxes are - they are made of very heavy cardboard and were very easy to assemble, about 2 minutes to do so. These are great boxes at a good comparable price. These are nice boxes - sturdy with a solid lid and hole/handle to lift them. These boxes solve that problem easily and just stack up neatly and have space to label with detail what is contained in them.

These really are the easiest boxes to use and the best for storing documents (or whatever) around the house or home office.

I guess I got hooked on this boxes when I was working in corporate America.
