My old pad had more drag and I'd often have to pick the mouse up and reposition it in order to access the parts of my screen I wanted to access. With this pad, everything rolls nicely and I don't find myself having to do the annoying repositioning.The one thing I'm not entirely thrilled with is the cover. You get a pad upon which the rocker can be placed, although I found it too large for my laptop in that it covered half the keyboard. The Wrist Rocker is very comfortable and my Apple Magic Mouse glides over the pad extremely easily, and the entire pad stays in place very well. This pad makes that action a lot easier.This is all invaluable to me because I am the type of person who has such large hands and equally big disabilities, I use the cushion-rest for the heel of my palm, not for my wrist. So I'm concerned about the Fellowes pad with its hard plastic that makes my mouse slide a bit more than I want it to slide.Besides, the pad I use now also has this gel-based bottom, exposed on the bottom so it "bonds" with my desk and the mousepad does not slide on the desk top. This Fellowes pad would truly have it all if it added a bit of this gel material to the pad, both inside the pad itself and some on the underneath to stabilize it on the desk surface. The I-Spire Series Wrist Rocker is a handsome, lightweight, well designed `mouse pad' variation. I tried using the pad without the pillow, but now neither way feels right. The pad itself is quite slick. The pad is also kind of ugly. That said, I do this that this pad is somewhat expensive for what it is.This thin plasticized/laminated mousepad with a special wrist rest is an intriguing alternative to gel pads. The pad itself is very smooth and the mouse glides right across it. I'm hoping the pad doesn't require constant cleaning.All other wrist pads I've had have been soft. On this pad, your wrist is tilted slightly up (not horizontal) before it tilts slightly downward towards the mouse. The pad upon which the mouse moves is deep enough that if I move my entire forearm forward so that my wrist is at the apex of the curve instead of following the entire contour, it keeps my wrist more horizontal.
