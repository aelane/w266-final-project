They stick nicely and are just the right size! The 3x3 square size is versatile.It is hard to get too excited about sticky notes. They stick well and are a good size for a real note. I still prefer this size sticky notes.They're big enough to write more than a word or two on and small enough to store nearly anywhere.The sticky portions seems to be a little wider and stickier too.Useful and worthwhile. The 3 X 3 size also makes them big enough to actually fit a message on, and the colors are interesting too. This is a great size for multi-purpose uses. The 3 x 3 size is my favorite - not so big to be overwhelming but large enough for any quick note.Great for your students and you need a couple for home also. Nice size (same as Post-Its). This 3x3 size is interesting and Avery stik'um is every bit the stuff of Post-its. The size is perfect--large enough for me to write on and then step back and still legibly see what I need to see. This size works well for me, large enough for a quick note and not too tiny to read.
