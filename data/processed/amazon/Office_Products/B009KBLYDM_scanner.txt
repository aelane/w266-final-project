While I would probably not use this scanner to make digital images to blow up larger than 8x10 or maybe 11x14, it is really a decent scanner if you want to digitally archive personal photos. A very good scanner, with sharp reproduction and multiple options. Honestly, this scanner reminds me of one I had more than a decade ago. So if you need this scanner solution it is worth it. This scanner is all the upgrade needed! But the scanner is auto programmed to enhance photos and it improved their quality immensely for some of them. I highly recommend this scanner! Even though the scanner still works, so W7 can clearly communicate with it, there's no W7 software so all I could do was single page scans. I plugged in the scanner, hooked it up, ran it, and had a perfect scan in short order, like less than fifteen minutes out of the box. If you are just looking for a decent scanner to eliminate some paper and clutter from your life, I think this will serve you quite well, as it has served me. This scanner is suprisingly both solid and lightweight. It is smaller than my giant film/negative scanner (which I love and which also is an Epson), and it doesn't have a carriage lock. The scanner was not recognized natively in OS X Lion, so I needed to install the driver package. I set this up easily and quickly and now I am a successful scanner! Could this scanner be any easier to use? And can you really fault a scanner for being too good?I'm just scratching the surface of what this can do, I'm sure. This little scanner is great for photo and document scanning. I would say this scanner is good for light to medium needs both photo and office, also it would great in dorm as it does not take up too much space. Small and light, this scanner is a perfect companion for a laptop. AirPrint Compatible (C11CC07201)which had already installed the Epson scanner toolbox. This scanner is a single page scanner for photos and documents.It comes with a 3 foot USB cable and the power cable. It installed the scanner driver and the Epson Scan utility.Probably my experience with this scanner is colored by the fact that I need it to work with legacy software and equipment. The Epson scanner works with it but it requires some tolerance on the part of the operator. I had ABBYYfine 6.00 from a previous scanner installation and never used it so I doubt if I will use version 9, which is a limited version of the software. This is a nice, modern scanner that does what it says it will without much fuss. This is my third Epson scanner (needed technology upgrades, not because the older ones broke). I am happy with this scanner. If you are in the scanner market, this unit is definitely worth your consideration. The Epson V37 is a really nice scanner for the price, but then I would expect no less from Epson, which has always seemed like a reliable choice. But do consider this scanner if you want a tidy little workhorse. I also used the scanner from aCanon PIXMA MX860 Wireless All-In-One office Printer. These are hard to scan with any scanner since the bumps act as tiny prisms, causing what looks like myriad dust spots. A scanner such as the V600 will do an additional infrared scan of transparencies and negatives to locate dust and allow you to remove it without compromising quality. Really not much to say on this scanner except it delivers as promised. This scanner does a very high quality job of scanning photos and documents.

I really like this Epson Perfection V37 scanner, and I think it's an exceptional value.We have numerous albums of photos from our pre-digital, 35MM camera days.

It is essentially the same scanner as theEpson Perfection V370 Color Photo Scannerbut with a different lid.
