But as for now, the chair mat is perfect. I put the chair mat on my indoor/outdoor carpeted floor and it is very sturdy. This chair mat is definitely for hard floors. This is rather disconcerting when the chair stops and I don't. This chair mat was a quick, easy and inexpensive solution. I have been using this chair mat to protect my hard wood floors. This Floortex chair mat is a good value considering the size of the package and free shipping. My chair can move around without getting stuck, and I don't worry about sliping from underneath me. This is a quite small chair mat, but it might work in a traditional office setup with a desk and not a lot of room to move the chair. My chair is one that rolls and is fairly new. My chair does not move freely on this mat and  the mat "wanders" it slides over the carpet.
