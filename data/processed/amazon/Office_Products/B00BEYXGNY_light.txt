I have not tried the "black light" effect yet, but have no doubt that they would look really neat in that lighting. Maybe it would be fine under a black light, as the package advertises, but I don't have a black light to test that.The best part about these Sharpies is even though they are permanent markers, they don't have a strong odor. Unfortunately though, you have to actually have a specific black light, not just a dark room. These are made for black light to apparently have a "glow" effect. As far as glowing under black light...I have no idea if that works since I don't have one. But really fun for black light activities - I plan on using them to personalize some stuff for a 'glow run' 5K later this year. I did not test these in a black light yet. They are supposed to glow under a black light -- but I don't have a black light. Under the black light, these light up great (see uploaded pic) so my kids are now excited about decorating some shirts with these Sharpies. It is cool how these will also work with a black light, which would be nice if you are doing some decorating or signs for Halloween or a party, where you will use a black light. I'm curious if that has to do with the black light florescence.I am bummed that I haven't had a chance to test the advertised ability of these markers to glow under black light, since I think that would be super awesome. I don't have a black light so I haven't been able to see what they look like under it, but I bet it would be fun to decorate a white t-shirt with these and then wear it out to a club or festival (EDC). Something she informed me of after using them... they glow under black light! We don't have a black light available so I can't review the black light aspect.
