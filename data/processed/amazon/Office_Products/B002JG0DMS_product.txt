Very nice product!!! I'm guessing this is because this is a new product. I'm not sure this is the most necessary product in the world, but I suppose there's a need for this. Good product. To me, it seems that this product solves a problem that really doesn't need to be solved. Overall, a great product. They are made in Mexico so the final product, at least, isn't shipped all the way around the planet. This product is a nice solution if you plan to reuse shipping containers. As expected from an Avery product, they are really high quality, peels and glues easily, and works with major shipping systems.On the other hand there are several issues you need to work around. This product is such an obviously great idea that I have to wonder why I've never seen anything like it before. I'll give this product 5 stars for doing a great job of being what it is supposed to be.

I still consider them a super product to have on hand.

This product does a great job of covering up other shipping labels or simply blending in to your cardboard box so it looks neat and tidy.

Ultimately, I think this product defeats that purpose.
