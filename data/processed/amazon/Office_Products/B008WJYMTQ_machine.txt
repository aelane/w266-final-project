I do recommend this machine for home and small businesses and anyone who might need to bind a report. Since it is a manual machine, you can place it anywhere as no electrical outlet is needed for use. I use this machine to organize my office papers, customer reports, tax reports, etc into attractive notebooks that are easier to store or mail. !This Pulsar Plus 150 is a well made machine. This machine is a lifesaver for me. I love this machine because when I'm traveling I can take it with me along with my other business necessities as it does not require a power source or batteries. I was dissapointed that the machine does not come with a sample comb of at least a few of the sizes. I think this machine will work well in small offices or at schools--wherever there is a need for small volume binding.

As it is, it is still an excellent machine for home or small office use.Edited to add: Besides the obvious projects such as binding reports, books, screenplays, etc., I recently discovered a delightful comb binding use for young children.
