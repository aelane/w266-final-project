Will definitely purchase a few more the the next school year! I use this Mead Zipper Binder not for school, but for personal work at home. It is so wide that it barely fits in a typical school backpack. If you're rough on school supplies you won't get more than a school year out of this.Water repellant? She's delighted and can't wait to take it to school. &#34;Old school&#34; literally! It also fits in a standard school backpack (I checked, as these things can be pretty bulky and tall. Best for school or light business use, and recommended on that basis.

This Binder is being marketed, I think, to school age use.
