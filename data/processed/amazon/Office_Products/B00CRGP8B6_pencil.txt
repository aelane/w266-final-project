I like that this pencil is sturdy--I don't feel like it's going to snap in my hand like the tiny ones, and it's great for kids.My kids and I have all had a fine time using these; however, when I gave one to my five-year-old nephew to use, he managed to break off the back in a matter of seconds. 8 pencil value pack. He is still learning how to properly hold a pencil. I like that it's removable so you can refill the pencil IF you can find the right size lead.So why did I give it 3 stars? Because each pencil comes with ONE lead. Otherwise, this is a nice pencil. A very great pencil to use, just wish the lead colors matched the barrel colors. Ideally, a mechanical pencil would have all of those positive attributes without all the negatives. probably the biggest is that they are just a very cool looking pencil! if i use a pencil once or twice a week, it is a lot. Each pencil in the 8-pack has a different colored barrel.I found these perfect for kids in that they eliminate the need for sharpeners and the inevitable shavings they generate. I have always held my pencil "wrong," and this shape/the wideness of the pencil actually makes the hold more comfortable for me. The pencil is very sturdy and the triangular shape makes it easy to hold. They feel like a pencil in your hand. I think I will still prefer a wooden pencil that I can sharpen to a fine point, because the thicker graphite on these pencils tend toward a blunt tip, but I think these mechanical pencils are especially suitable for elementary or middle school aged kids who want to write with a mechanical pencil. The pencil is nicely balanced5. The pencil lead gets better once you've used them for a while. I actually tilted the pencil to the side and did a rubbing to make the tip have a bit of a point. Favorite green pencil ruined and he moved onto the red. The pencil itself is nice. However, if you want a really good solid mechanical pencil and don't plan to use it for hours on end, this product would be perfect. My regular mechanical pencil is a Dr. Even pencil writing is smeared beyond belief which is quite annoying even at my advanced age. So, I am a pencil junkie. I try every new pencil and pen that I come across. I tried to put the pencil topper erasers on it but they broke trying to get them on, so it is either shell out or use a gummy. It is good to have a refillable pencil, and the triangle barrel (smoothed) means the pencils are not as likely to roll off a desk.

)If ever you need a pencil for anything, this is the one to get!

After writing with the pencil, it proves to be a good writing instrument - just flows well across the paper and no broken leads.I am sharing with my family ; )

My first thought while testing out the pencil was, "why on earth aren't all writing implements designed this way?"
