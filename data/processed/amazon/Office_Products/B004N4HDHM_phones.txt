While we only needed three phones, I ended up getting this kit so I'd have two handsets/bases as spares. We bought these phones to replace an older set, and I have to say, these are definitely an upgrade. The phones look great in person and have good reception. Very happy with these phones. We ordered this after our old phones kept failing. So if my phones dying (and have to plug it into the charger) or if I set it down in one part of my house I get reception in, yet want to go into the den or basement where I do not - I can "transfer" the call to this system and continue the conversation just the same. We're running around so much that we just keep both phones separate. Our last Panasonic phones died on us after years of use so we decided on the 7644 and have loved them so far. The phones are light. In the past, we have had other phones, but prefer this brand. I like these phones and given the chance to purchase again I probably would. I can tell you to stay away from Vtech, any of the Vtech phones I have bought die or short out in 2-3 years. We put the phones in the kitchen, living room, and upstairs bedroom.
