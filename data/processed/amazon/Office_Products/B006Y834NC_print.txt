The print quality is good, and the print speed is excellent. The print quality was sharp, crisp and just plain fantastic. However, I found that print looked like it was made up of tiny dots, and thin serifs, like in a capital T, were missing dots and looked not like a line but like a bunch of dots trying to be a line. The print quality is right up there with the best, with bright, crisp colors and it cranks out the pages as fast as any inkjet style printer on the market.I have it set up as a wireless printer/scanner on my home network. The print quality is EXCELLENT. The print quality is great, the colors are crisp, and the speed is quite nice. It can Scan, Copy, Fax, print on both sides, use wireless, ethernet, sd, xd, everything imaginable that you would need to run an efficient office lies in this printer. It is easy to set up, and the print and scan quality is surprisingly good. The print quality is awesome, it was easy to set up, and I couldn't be happier with the device! The print quality is very good. I can view, print, copy (and delete those annoying junk faxes).
