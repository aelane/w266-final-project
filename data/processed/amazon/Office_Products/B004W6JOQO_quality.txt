He mentioned it could be the quality of the paper. This is good quality paper. Good quality. Great quality paper-highly recommended. The quality of the paper itself is top of the line. It seems to be good quality and I like the weight of the paper over others I've bought in the past. This is very high quality paper. I can't attest to the quality of the printing because it just looks like normal printing to me - I'm printing text, not pictures - however, I do think it produces a much better-looking copy in general than the really cheap papers that I had been using. I mean, how often do you comment on the quality of printer paper? Acid-free, it should be durable, and the 92 bright white quality produces fine photographs as well as documents. I really like the quality of this paper. Sometimes, it really is worth it to buy a better quality paper at a bit higher price and not have to deal with ruining my printers.As an added bonus, the heavy box is delivered to my door from Amazon and I don't have to lug it home from a brick and mortar retailer. So I am very happy with the quality of this product and plan to continuing using it in the future.
