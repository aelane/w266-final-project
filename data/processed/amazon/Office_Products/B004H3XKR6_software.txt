You need the software installed of course, but that's a given. And for that, the software succeeds. I'm sure this could be remedied in software, but as I've mentioned, the PDF conversion software that comes with the printer is not very sophisticated. Scanning is handled with software, and I was pleased with my ability to choose either the glass surface or the document feeder from my computer. After installing the software, I realized that the Epson support site had newer software. Scanning was also somewhat slow until I realized that this was largely software controlled and could be sped up considerably. Setting up the software on each computer in the house was easy as well and simply following the instructions allowed me to do the setup without problems.TheEpson WorkForce 840 Color Ink Jet Wireless All-in-One with Fax (C11CA97201)is definitely user friendly and I have found, for most tasks, I do not need to engage with my computer to operate this device. They could improve the software for setting it up (like the ability to hit "back" when it's not working right). The included software is useful, as you can scan to pdf, scan to excel, scan to email, or scan to pc, from one menu.The 30-page auto document feeder on top makes life easier when faxing/scanning/copying a stack of papers. I haven't used the OCR software yet and but that is really not relevant to the copier itself and the scanner function will create PDFs. You no longer have to install any Epson software at all if you are using OS X 10.7 Lion. Apple's software update has kept the printer drivers up to date and it performing correctly without me having to do anything or be aware of software for the printer at all. I also could have installed Epson'sprinting/scanning software, but I preferred not to because I've never beenimpressed with the manufacturer's software.PrintingAs Epson claims on the box and description, this printer is really fast.Prints came out as quick as razor printer. I will warn you that the software that comes with the printer doesn't work with Windows 7, but it's a quick download from epson.com.---Fax---I have not used the fax line as of yet because I do not have a landline.---Wi-Fi---I have absolutely no problems with the Wi-Fi on this printer. The software and documentation were straight forward. Using the "EPSON Scan" software, I was able to scan the page in as a ".tif" file. The included software was even smart enough to recognize that I was using WIndows 7 Service Pack 1, which rendered the old drivers inoperable, and direct me to the proper fix to get it working. The included software is not too bulky and easy to use, so unlike my previous fax machine, I can send docs through the fax directly from my computer instead of having to print them up first.Overall, I am very satisfied with the Workforce and can see myself using it for awhile to come. The software took quite a while to install. Once the software was installed. Fire up the Epson Scan software and tell it to scan. The Lexmark comes out ahead here though, as it includes OCR software that can scan a document full of text to say, a Word document instead of just a PDF or image.Copying is just as simple, and with the auto document feeder you can put a pile of papers on the printer, press the copy button and the printer goes to town. Just be sure to install the software on each computer you wish to be able to print from.Epson has included 2 sheets of their brand of inkjet paper, as well. You will need to download the updated software from the Epson website.CONNECTING WIRELESSLY: To connect this to your wireless internet, make sure you have a router with the functionability to connect wireless printers.

You have to install the software on every computer that will be using the printer wirelessly.
