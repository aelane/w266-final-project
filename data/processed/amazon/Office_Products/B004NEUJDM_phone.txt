The phone's sound quality is very good. On my old phone, a single tap and I was there--and the display showed name, phone number and time called. This phone is just CRAZY. Once you finally get there, the phone's screen displays a message that says "Please Wait" After about three seconds, the list appears...but even then it doesn't show the number, just the name. To see the incoming phone number and time called I must click the name...and only one number and time displays at once! The ten-year old phone displayed the list instantly, with all the info.I purchased this model "like new" from Uniden (box had been opened by a consumer but phone perfect condition) for $35. Not worth returning, so I'll be giving it away.For those who are interested, of the three phone systems I tested, including this one, and a Vtech, the best (or perhaps I should say least disappointing, was this one:Panasonic KX-TG4053B DECT 6.0 PLUS Expandable Digital Cordless Phone with Answering System & Range Extender, Black, 3 Handsets. I can't tell you how awesome this is, and I don't know how Uniden does it because the phone is not suppressing the first ring like some systems do...you still hear the first ring when a number is not blocked. *The phone's electronics are very slow. I like the phone handset to ring loud, since I can choose that ring tone. Great phone. The phone itself (the part you hold) is nice and light.Setting it up is easy - however you do need to have patience to learn all of it's nifty features...see, I'm old enough to use the word "nifty!" LOL ...  May they never know what I called them in my phone book! Just get this great little phone and enjoy it.Excellent for anyone with a hearing aid too (though I don't have one). The phone works great. The phone has a lot of features and the manual is well written and easy to understand.
