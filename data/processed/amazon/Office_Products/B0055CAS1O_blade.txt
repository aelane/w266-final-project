And although I'd like it better with a bigger, sharper blade (like an exacto knife), it was able to open most of the packs without problem (those very thick plastic casings didn't work very well). If I forget to hide the blade, then I'm not too worried because it's fairly small--it's just deep enough to cleanly go through plastic.So pros versus cons, I'm glad I was able to receive this product and will continue to use it over a knife or scissors. The blade is quite tiny, the size of a "v" in 12 font type. The blade is so small you have to get it exactly positioned correctly to even have a chance for it to work. I like that the blade is refillable; the brand of safety utility knife that I usually use is not.The cons:The safety is rather flimsy and it didn't seem very safe to me compared to my usual brand. The blade was also very small and it didn't cut fabric well.Overall:Its a nice small utility knife, but I still prefer another brand. The tiny blade is ineffective against most anything. It is safer than a large open blade, but you need to work slowly and carefully. Just above the blade opening, there is an engraved straight line in the handle. If you press or pull too hard, the blade cartridge will pop out, so you need to work slowly. The blade is anchored in a plastic block about the size of a thumbnail. The blade recesses back into the slot, supposedly out of harm's way, though the slot is rather wide (to accommodate the plastic block that holds the blade) and the blade does not recess down very far inside. When I was testing it, it slipped ... and had the blade not been so itsy-bitsy, I would have sliced my finger wide open. The blade is short enough to allow the package to be braced on a table to make it easier to cut. The blade click mechanism isn't overly precise and you have to be careful when extending the blade to get it in the correct position. The tiny blade is too hard to position correctly and isn't sharp or large enough to do the job right. The blade is not replaceable, and so when it dulls, you have to throw the entire thing away. Setting that aside, the blade isn't sharp enough or deep enough to make a serious impact on the plastic packages that its marketed as being able to open. The blade itself that is exposed is not much more than a small corner. The blade is retractable and very small. The blade is much too shallow to allow for any deep cuts, which means it doesn't cut very well at all. The blade is not sharp. Possibly more safe, because only about 3mm of the blade sticks out and hardly does any damage. Then when you are done you can retract it so the blade is covered and no chance of cutting yourself. It is supposed to have a refillable blade but I cannot find them anywhere. The tiny blade is meant not to accidentally cut too deeply, damaging your purchases. A large enough blade for typical small household jobs, but small enough to avoid the hazards. It's a sharp blade but they really should have gone just a little bigger so the blade could guide itself better. The blade flew off on the second item and it was destroyed.Probably not sturdy enough for blister packs... 1/5 for the effort..would be rated lower if I could. The blade is small, so it is safer than using a box cutter, but it is also nearly impossible to follow the contours of some packaging. The blade really is tiny, but it does what it says it does, it makes such short work of packaging that you won't believe it until your soy sauce starts dripping all over you, or your CD wrapping falls off. The blade is easy to slide open and close bu depressing the button on top. It is sharp and you like any blade you can cut yourself or another if not careful.Scotch says the blades can be replaced, but I have not figured out how to open it nor have I fond a place that sells replacement blades.Let me add that this opener works much better on hard plastic packages. I've not used it enough to have the blade go dull, but I'm sure in time that it will. It feels incredibly light and flimsy, the blade isn't all that sharp and is absolutely tiny.
