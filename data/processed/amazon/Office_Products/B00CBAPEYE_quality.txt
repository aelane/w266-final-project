For better quality prints, I will recommend a laser printer if budget is not a problem. I have been pleased with the printing quality of all the printers by Epson I have tried, including the XP-410. Print quality is decent and photo quality was very good, with superb color and clarity. Great quality color for such a compact printer4. The quality is excellent, the speed is very good and there is a very low noise level for my printer. Epson quality has always been at the forefront and this is no exception. Copy quality is excellent with decent printing rate. But what about quality? On just regular quality, a 4x6 photo took 1 minute and 26 seconds to print. High quality doubles that time.-It has an SD slot, but no other memory card slots, so you'll need an adapter for a micro card, or you'll need to upload photos to your computer before printing.-Display is not touch-responsive. Printing quality is better than I expected at this price point, but far from what you would get at your local drug store. High quality prints, beautiful scans, full-featured copies, PC-free templates, convenient wireless connectivity and so much more at such a low price brings significant value to this compact and feature-rich home office solution. (4) Print quality for text is amazing. Print quality is excellent and fast. The scan quality is superb, and the adjustments that you can make in front of the scan are easy to tweak. You don't see the low quality on your monitor-- it's something that comes out when you print it. As long as you're using high quality images, or you just want to print text documents, printing from these sources will give you exactly what you need.Choose this printer if you need to print from sources like phones and memory cards, or if you just want quality photo, image and text printing from your regular PC.C
