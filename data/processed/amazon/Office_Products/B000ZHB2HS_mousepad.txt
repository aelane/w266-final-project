If you are not using an ergonomic mousepad, it can take some getting used to in terms of its dimensions, but overall does the job well.Other reviewers have said that it is failry large, but I disagree. I'm very satisfied with this mousepad with gel wrist pad. This mousepad is an ideal mix of comfort and optimal surface for mouse. This is pricey for a mousepad, but you are going to get what you pay for. This mousepad also offers antimicrobial protection. it is more comfortable to use than a standard mousepad. But overall, it is still the best mousepad I have ever used. I had an inexpensive mousepad, but it worked just fine. Best of all, the mousepad is built very well, I don't forsee any problems with it in the near future, and the fact that it's a 3M product is just as reassuring.

Up until I got this mousepad, I had been carting around a bulky, old, nasty-looking neoprene mousepad, one that I was planning to replace with a newer, less dirty neoprene mousepad because it was rather comfortable to use.Then I saw this little guy and figured what did I have to lose?
