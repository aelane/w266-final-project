It's unfortunate that Ooma charges $40 for porting but I factored that into the cost of the system so it's not a deal-killer for me.Activation includes a 60 day free trial of their Premier service. But I can live with that since the Ooma is about 1/4th the cost of Vonage on a yearly basis. We had a little more start up cost than some. Although I was first tempted by the low cost of the Ooma service, the thing that sold me was the ability to block unwanted calls.There are two levels of call blocking:  The Community blacklist is a list of blocked numbers maintained by Ooma. Each of them can now drastically reduce their monthly cost for telephone service from the current $70/month down to whatever the taxes are where each of them lives.I had considered eliminating my landlines completely because I have cell phone service. Initial cost is huge compared with other VOIP providers. $200 for the initial cost plus $40 to port the number is simply too much. I figure though that the cost of the device is easily worth it if the device lasts the warranty period of 1 year.

When you add that to the cost of naked DSL from AT&T; ($42.95), it was actually a worse deal than AT&T;'s phone + internet bundle which is only $59.95.

You pay a fairly hefty up front cost to purchase the OOMA Telo device (between $150 and $200) and then it will cost you about $4.00 or $14.00 a month for OOMA's services.
