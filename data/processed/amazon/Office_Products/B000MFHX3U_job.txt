They do the job & do it well; highly recommended. They do a good job of getting most of the marking off of my board. It did a great job of getting rid of some shadows left behind by the paper towel I had been using before. The 3M Whiteboard Eraser does a good job. If so, it doesn't do a great job. I found that it does a better job even while dry in getting off that kind of residue compared to traditional erasers, but to get the board completely clean of this old print residue you really have to use water with this eraser. They do the job perfectly, no mess. It did a very good job and I highly recommend it. but with these it was easy the do the job and do it well I was surprized to see how well they worked!! It even did a good job on wet (just written) lines. Shocked, actually, that it does such a great job with such little effort. It did a good job of erasing fresh marks on a whiteboard when used dry. I will say the job wasn't easy, there was some serious elbow grease needed to get this board clean, but it looks great.

The Mr. Clean pads do an good job, but tend not to last long compared to the 3M, which are also better suited to leaving around when very slightly damp.

They do an OK job at a quick clean, but do not remove every mark well.

Did a great job on the regular old white board, but so did the standard eraser, The Foray circular eraser with cleaner head underneath, and the Expo white board spray, and none of these helped a lick with that month-at-a-glance on the old wall.
