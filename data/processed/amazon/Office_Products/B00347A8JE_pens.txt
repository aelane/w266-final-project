The pens still work, but it is strange that both pens developed holes in identical locations. These pens are roughly two dollars a pop and I do like that they are refillable so that you can use them over again without excess waste. I also tend to press hard when I write but these pens withstood the abuse my writing puts a pen through. I highly recommend these pens for your general writing purposes. You can buy much more expensive pens but you will not get that much better use out of them. I like gel pens, but the Tul brand I use clogs, looses it's flow, and runs out of ink easily. These pens are wonderful. Somehow, these pens don't seem to suffer from that problem. Being left handed, I tend to be picky about my pens, to the point that I usually use a fountain pen to write, in my effort to avoid smudging (the ink dries on the paper much faster than most pens). However, these pens have worked just fine for me, although they do glide across the paper much smoother than my fountain pen and do occasionally smudge. I loose pens all the time and these balance well in the hand. I normally bought Zebra pens and paid a few bucks more. But it looked great!So these pens might not be the best choice for scribbling notes to yourself in a hurry. This is one of the best pens I have used in a long time. The pens are refillable. The pens had some sort of goop on the tip of each when opened which was removed with some work.I finally got each one to write, but in both cases, the pens skip at times, drag as if something is between the pen and the paper, and don't write well or even poorly. I'm reviewing these pens as someone who has carpal tunnel syndrome and has trouble gripping pens and writing instruments. However, these pens are of medium thickness, and not like the really thin Bics, so they're still pretty comfortable. I wish they had pens like this when I was in school.Gel inks will run if subjected to water before given a chance to dry. I use pens everyday for both work and play, so when I saw the option of trying the Bic Triumph 537RT, retractable gel pen I jumped all over it. And finally, (5) these pens are reasonably priced. You can't beat under $5 for two well made and reliable pens, especially if you are in a profession that requires you to use them often. I've used many pens that don't feel right in the hand, or the ink is not smooth, or the retracting mechanism works poorly. These pens are relatively inexpensive and relatively high-end in terms of performance. all this to say, that i consider myself pretty picky when it comes to pens and these gel pens are quite nice to write with. I am always looking for pens that have that special touch, you know smooth, and easy to write with. I have used many pens that are awkward and vex the hand after a bit of use.B
