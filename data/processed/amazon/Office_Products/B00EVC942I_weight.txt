There's enough weight to it that it feels nice in the hand and the ink flows smoothly from the medium point tip.I had no problems with skipping, ink pooling or smudging. The weight of this pen makes it feel substantial without it being too heavy. The weight is solid, and the circumference substantial for his larger-than-average hand. It is classy looking with a nice weight to it. Pen has nice weight, matte finish, comes in a great little black box with elastic band. I like the heavy weight of this pen in my hand. The weight feels nice in my hand, but also in my husband's, so I think this would be a good choice for men or women. I love the Pilot MR. Sleek and attractive and just the right weight. It has a nice weight to it and doesn't feel cheap. The weight of the pen is good and it opens with a twist. It's just the right weight. The weight and size of the pen feel perfect in my hand, and it doesn't create any stress or cramping over time. It lacks the weight of a fine pen but it also lacks the big price tag. It has a nice weight to it and seems well constructed.
