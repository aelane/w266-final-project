I put them in these pocket tabs and so I can bring them with me to school or leave them at home by the computer. The pocket doesn't look very nice. These pocket tabs are just the ticket for DVDs CDs and other similar items that need to be organized. These CD-size pocket tabs are fantastic! I actually hurt myself trying to close the pocket up again after putting a CD in it. The pocket did easily stick and re-stick when I tried it in different places and positions. I have adhered the pocket to a "cover" page for a section (60 lb cardstock) the CD stays in place and the pocket stays stuck. They are basically an instant pocket that you can stick just about anywhere, and I use mine in notebooks, binders, and dividers that don't have pockets.They have a tab and slot closure that is surprisingly secure. Rather than just an open ended pocket, there is a fold over top that appears to lock in a closed position. The pocket has an adhesive strip and a tab that can can be labeled. I ordered these pocket tabs since I own a small business and I am always looking for innovative office products to help me with my organization and filing needs. The pocket tabs worked great on the plastic divider, but using card stock or paper dividers left the page floppy from the weight of the pocket tab and its contents. I stuck the pocket to a page and wrote on the tab what I was putting in the pocket and was able to easily sort my receipts. The pocket tabs also remove from the page easily without leaving any sticky residue and will stick once again to another page without a problem.
