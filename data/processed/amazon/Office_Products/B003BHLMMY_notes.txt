These notes solve the problem of the tiny space by using a tab on the side for less "fringy" books when you're done, but you still have almost the space of a regular sticky note pad on which to write. Ok, there are so many Post-It notes on the market....colors, shapes and sizes. I will be buying more!UPDATE March 6th:I have discovered that these post-it notes damage book pages if left on for very long. If you want to document notes on a subject while on the phone:  great, I would do that and use the tab to write "1", "2", "3" and so on, (these were government-related calls, so of course it called for alot of tabs) and before I knew it, there I had credible, neat notes all in an actual row to just ''glue'' to the existing documentation which started the call...the uses are as limited only insofar as my imagination. They are also labeled as being "Super Sticky," meaning that you can attach the notes, remove them, and then re-use them again; I did find this to work, although I didn't really challenge it all that much. The notes stick securely, yet can be removed and replaced numerous times without significant decrease in the sticking ability. These particular notes which have lines are great for note-taking - neatly. These are perfect for taking quick notes about a certain part of a text and then using the tab to reference the page. These Post-It notes are made of thicker paper than the regular square ones. Compared to other typical sticky notes, this Note Tab is relatively thicker and doesn't absorb ink fast. Make notes on it and use as a bookmark or a marker in a file. Make notes on it and stick it on the fridge, desk, computer monitor, dishwasher....  How can you go wrong when you make something out of one of the best inventions of our lifetime? Or to add little side notes of information, etc. They are lined for writing legible notes and being Post-It, can be stuck in the book without ruining it. The notes hold fast in difficult situations that come up frequently in traveling. They are also lined, so you can be neat about writing notes on them (let's face it, many people tend to scribble quickly on yellow Post-Its).Post-It is marketing these as useful in binders, planners, and paper piles. I love being able to write notes on them, too. and want to jot notes about something...especially if the book isn't yours. The fifty notes to the pack I received were more than adequate for me as I sorted through the last year's accumulation of filing in order to close out the year. They are larger than I expected and allow me to make notes to myself and easily find passages that I wish to quote. Certainly these make it easy to jot little notes quickly and neatly, though I can't recommend upgrading from a regular post-it. These notes stick well and remove easily. I recommend writing notes on a separate surface if possible, waiting a minute or so, and then placing it on the page.3. And most of my notes would be on the computer (paper stickies don't work so well there).Maybe if I were a CEO? These sturdy notes feel meant to last. These post-it notes are perfect for those who want to remember a quotation in a book, a reference citation, or even a paragraph that you may want to point out to someone.These post-its are the super sticky variety. That means these notes can be removed and re-situated without damaging the page. These notes are great for marking in cookbooks or other books that you can't, or don't want to, write in directly. I like how well they stick and how I can write notes on them. Think about how you will use these notes - do you need to read what is underneath the Note?

They stick well, even better than most post-it notes I've had.

I like them for taking notes and marking an important page, but they are large so they do end up covering quite a bit of space in the book -- not a big deal if there's empty space on the page, or an area you don't care about, but I can see how it would be annoying for some.

The notes are lightly lined and provide plenty of space to jot notes.
