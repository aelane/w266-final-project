The pens themselves are as nice as these Gelwriters can be - smooth, steady ink flow, clear stems to see teh ink level, rubberized grips, and color-matched caps. I love these pens. Love these pens and the cases. The pens all write well (which isn't always the case with gel pens), and there's a wide variety of colors, including some with glitter, which are my favorite. While you get 72 pens in the set, you don't get 72 different colors as several of the colors (black, purple, and blue, for example) are repeated. But the pens themselves are marvelous--I'll be using them for years to come! you receive here seventy two pens in two separate and very strong carrying cases, very useful and providing extra security to your treasured gel pens, the envy of all your department.very portable cases too, easily slipped into any larger bag, safely, with two secure latches and a delightfully soft carrying strap.the colors are wonderful and present a full, vivid pallette most useful in today's marketyou may never go digital again . The pens are very smooth. Gel pens have come a long way since the first generation and many of the problems that plagued the first generation, erratic flow, pastels that didn't show up on black paper, etc...are no longer an issue.The carrying cases make these great for kids getting together with friends to do some drawing. These pens were made for me!Pros:*The COLORS! The pens come in two nice carrying cases, which will work well for scrapbookers who travel to events, though the cases also make a nice place to keep pens at home as well. And these pens are well suited to that purpose, since they are archival quality and acid-free. The pens write in a vibrant gel, and half of them are glitter-infused. First, the pens write quite heavily (too heavy for some applications, e.g. I already knew I loved these pens, but these cases make them even better. I do love the pens; I wish my set didn't include duplicates of certain colors, such as the brownish-orange colors (I have maybe 6 overall of the one shade between this set and the 100 set, yet only 4 of each blue, green, purple, and others). The TEKwriter Gel pens are without question the gold standard, and this set is crazy loaded with color!!! And these pens can take a real beating unlike most get pens (think kids using them and leaving the caps off for a couple of days). I love pens. I was so excited to have all these pens and all of these great colors. She loved the pens too.... Great colors and again they write well.... I highly recommend these pens if you have a fetish for pens like I do...  A must have!! These pens write very smoothly, and are a joy to use. The 72 pens come in 2 cases of 36 each, which is great when you travel, if you only want to take a smaller number with you. She also could tell that the pens wrote very smoothly and enjoyed the many colors that are available to use. These pens will get used over and over again at my house and I think they will last a while. I would recommend the pens to anyone who enjoys scrapbooking, letter writing or anyone who wants to write with gel pens. Wow, I am so impressed with these pens, they are nice quality.
