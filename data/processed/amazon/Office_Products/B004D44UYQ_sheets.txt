Then when I asked you to staple more than 9 sheets of paper, you failed me altogether. It will staple 15 sheets of paper, even the thicker paper, and the staples close tightly. Says it will do fifteen sheets, and it does! I tested it on 15 sheets of copy paper and it stapled them successfully on the first attempt. I tried 16, then 15 sheets of the usual office copy paper (20 lb), and the stapler just wouldn't work. 14 sheets: it did staple 14 sheets, but the pointy ends of the staples did not close into the paper, making them a bit of a scratch hazard. 13 sheets: yup, the stapler handles 13 sheets of paper just fine.Non-intuitive loading: I stared at the graphic on the stapler's bottom for several moments and just couldn't figure out how to open the device to refill staples. But don't expect the Evo to staple 15 sheets; I could only get it to go through 13 max. I tried it with 15 sheets, as they advertise, and it worked perfectly.The stapler is light weight so perfect for carrying with you if you travel for business, or just need to keep a stapler in you purse or briefcase. it functions as advertised easily blasting through 15 sheets without fail. I was able to staple 15 sheets of 20lb.
