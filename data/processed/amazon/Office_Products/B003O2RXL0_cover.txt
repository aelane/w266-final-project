The cover color is pleasant. The cover is is plasticized to resist liquids. The cover and backing are very sturdy and look like they'd easily survive a college semester. The cover is heavy duty and will hold up well. The cover is very sturdy and attractive and the spiral binding is well made with ends that are crimped so they don't snag. The cover is a stiff sheet of plastic which while waterproof is easily creased and bent. The back cover is a glossy cardboard which might resist water for a few moments.This is a five-subject notebook. The cover of the notebook is sturdy and water-resistant, so if your best friend rests her Latte on your notebook, no harm done. The cover is a pliable but sturdy plastic and the dividers have pockets on each side that come in handy for handouts. The cover is a very dark midnight blue, mostly matte finish plastic, but very flexible. Back cover is cardboard, so while the front is water resistant, I'd be careful setting this down on anything wet. I've always liked the front cover of the five star notebooks since they stay sturdy and don't get as many marks on them. A good strong cover is necessary because if it rips off then you just have paper on a spiral. It's got a durable cover that won't tear accidentally and shields the paper from water, so your valuable notes are protected. The cover is durable vinyl, and the notebooks are good for any use, if you are hard on notebooks, if you keep them a long time, or if you just like colorful covers.
