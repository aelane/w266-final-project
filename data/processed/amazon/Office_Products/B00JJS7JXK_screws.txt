There are several small screws that have to be undone and then it has to be pried out of its shell. Even with all the screws out, I couldn't figure out how to take it apart for a long time. There are five small screws on the back of the light and these must be removed to access the compartment at all. tiny screws and take off the whole back of the light. You must remove 5 very tiny screws in order to remove the entire back of the light. They could have designed this to take bigger screws. The screws are small by the way and require a small screw driver, one that might come in a set for fine electronic work.Once the batteries are inserted and the screws re-installed, the light works just fine. Removing the screws again to put in fresh batteries down the road will be a problem. There are very tiny screws on the back that you have to remove to insert the AAA batteries. The screws are very small and not made strong, so you have to take care to not strip the screws when using the screwdriver to remove or replace them.Once the batteries are in, I found this light to be useful everywhere you need a bright light in small spaces. The screws are recessed and very small, you have to have a very specific tiny screwdriver to open the back to put in the batteries.

You have to take five tiny screws out to release the housing to put batteries in.

Removing the screws is tedious and must be done carefully without damaging the slots.

And, they are either really cheap, not well-machined screws, or we stripped them in the process, but they were difficult to screw all the way back in.
