This all makes it an amazingly simple kit to use. This kit is great for making reports look professionally bound at home. I was excited to try this binding kit out, because as a landscaper I thought it would be very cool to send bound portfolios/ information about my business to potential clients who I am about to meet with. This kit allows you to make approximately 4 sturdy reports. I wish that the kit had double the cardstock pages because I think that projects are more durable with one sturdy page in front and back. This kit contains all that you'll need to spiral bind four 10-page documents. This practical, fast, and easy to use kit comes with everything you need to print and bind up to four 10-page Reports. Although, this kit makes it easy to bind and unbind a document, my concern is the economy of the process and the pre-punched refill paper.Twist and Bind is definitely worth having, but it's not an end-all-be-all for your kids and their school documents. This kit will give you all you need to make 4 spiral bound documents. With this kit you can do it at home for a fraction of the cost! The kit contains materials to produce four bound documents of ten pages each. I highly recommend this kit for anyone needing to make a good impression on a report. I used this kit to corral my stash of printed from the Internet recipes. The binding kit was easy to use and didn't take up a ton of the paper I had used to print the recipes. I would recommend the kit to anyone. I have looked at this binding kit for several weeks now wondering what to do with it. While these would make the kit better, including them would make it a different kit, which would need to be evaluated separately.If you want convenience with professional results for a small number of short reports (the target consumer for this kit) you can't really go wrong with this kit. However, the kit will allow for four 10-page reports.The really fantastic part of these report kits is that it allows you to attach a spiral binding without use of a complicated, or expensive, spiral binding machine! Fellowes Twist and Bind All in One Machineless binding kit is a great addition to homeschooling.Pros:Can create 4 manuels or books without any bulky machine.Easy to use, just watch the video posted here next to the pictures of product.DurableCons:Only 4 rings, need to purchase more.
