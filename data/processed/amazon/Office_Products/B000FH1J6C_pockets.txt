And inside there are extra pockets! There's even some small pockets in the spine, great for business cards.I know I'm going to really like the larger size and the ease of use. The pockets were a nice bonus that I didn't realize would be there. The pockets in the front and back are also handy. pockets for paperwork and notes. The stacked pockets in the front and back are handy for adding notecards/papers that go with the contents in the binder but keep in mind, they are slender pockets not meant to overstuff with materials. I like the inside pockets: two in the front (one higher than the other), two in the rear and two on the binder that are just about the right size for business cards but just a little too deep.The rings are precise, with no overlap to interfere with turning pages. The four pockets (two in the front and two in the back inside covers) in lieu of the normal two pockets makes it easier to store booklets, pamphlets, notes, etc. It has inside pockets and the best rubber coated level to open the rings that I've ever seen! The pockets are on the front and back of the binder so you have places to separate and store needed items that may not fit into the rings.At OVER $10+ dollars, this binder is meant for a LOT of pages. There are also multiple pockets in the front and back to hold things. Two of the pockets are deep, more than half the height of the covers. The other two pockets are lower and are placed in front of the two larger pockets.The D-rings open with just the touch of one hand -- very easy. Two inside pockets, one on top of the other (for a total of 4) on each side of the cover. I also like using the little inside pockets for pamphlets and brochures of places we have visited during the year.I prefer the heavy duty because I have dropped my binders on occasion: the rings don't pop open, and the cover doesn't tear down the seam.
