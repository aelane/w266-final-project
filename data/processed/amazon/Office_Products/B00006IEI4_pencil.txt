In particular, I recall one where you insert the pencil vertically and that action started the electric motor. So, as it grinds the pencil away, it suddenly starts to spin freely, your pencil quits disappearing down the hole, and you know it's done. This is the electric pencil sharpener issued by the Seattle School District to all classrooms. My old pencil sharpener was one of the standard office models that are in every office in the country -- slow, inefficient and barely more productive than one of the little hand jobs. I highly recommend this pencil sharpener -- every home and office should have one. This little pencil sharpener does exactly what it should do and quite a bit more. This pencil sharpener is strong enough to handle any job, and easy enough for anyone to handle. This was one of the two available at Office Depot that advertised their quietness.Pros- Much quieter than most electric pencil sharpeners- Big shavings receptacle- Fast, even sharpeningCons- Nothing that wasn't personal taste/feel. We really like this pencil sharpener, design, and color. We do like the automatic pencil stop, so many times with a regular pencil sharpener the pencil gets sucked down for lunch and before you know it you're left with a stub of a brand new pencil! I love having this electronic pencil sharpner at home. While the adjustable pencil guide (with various size holes) helps somewhat, it's hard to get consistently good sharpening with a single cutter model unless you're very careful about it.Replacement cutter blades are available on Amazon:X-ACTO S Replacement Pencil Sharpener Cutter/Carrier RackA similar alternative to consider isStanley Bostitch QuietSharp6 Pencil Sharpener.Manual pencil sharpeners to consider include the Westcott School iPoint Manual Pencil Sharpener.Or, a couple basic options:Staedtler Metal Sharpeners, Double Hole for Pencils and Colored PencilsorStaedtler Metal Double Hole Sharpener with Tub(but see the reviewsfor the same product here) I've never experienced such pencil sharpening perfection in my life. What's better than a perfectly sharpened pencil?
