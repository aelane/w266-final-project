I tend to not like mechanical pencils because the lead is so delicate and they break easy. There are no more short, dull pencils around our house any more since we received these! We were all so tired of having to sharpen pencils every other day! I use these pencils for working on Sudoku puzzles. The pencils write dark. However, these pencils should be great for students or anyone else likely to lose them as well as for anyone who wants a larger lead for very little money. Because...1) These pencils are really cheap and that means I won't care if someone steals one at work. They probably figure the pencils are so cheap you'll just pitch 'em when the leads & eraser run out, but just so you know, you don't have to.All in all, if you like to have a pencil at hand at all times, these are a great, affordable, and satisfying solution. The pencils leave clean, non-smudging lines. Unfortunately, the "Matic Grip" pencils do not appear to be available with 0.9mm leads.P.S. These pencils come with two spare leads each. Two of the 10 pencils were defective -- the lead kept sliding back into the body of one pencil when pressure was applied, and the other could not advance the lead. As I've used the pencils more, I've had more problems with lead handling. I use mechanical pencils daily and am frustrated when a pencil doesn't work or it breaks off too easily. I have tested a few different pencils in the package and all seem high quality. I happen not to like most pencils, as I'm left-handed, and I weary quickly of smeared print and smudged hands.The Bic students choice mechanical pencils are thus a welcome addition to my office. .09 MM Bic mechanical pencils are perfect for use in classrooms along with anywhere else. I will definitely be purchasing these pencils and will recommend them for my students. I like mechanical pencils but, as I'm a pretty hard writer, the lead breaks off too easily or I end up scratching holes in the paper. These pencils have thicker lead so that isn't a problem. With these mechanical pencils, however, that isn't the case. I chose the BIC Students Choice mechanical pencils for my 8YO son for homework use. BIC mechanical pencils for students is a great choice for having a more useful, practical pencil for school work or as a general writing tool for anyone. These pencils write very well, but the most important thing to me is the eraser. Mechanical pencils finally won that battle. When I tried these pencils out, I first checked how easily the lead would break when writing. I am most impressed with these mechanical pencils. Yes, you can buy slightly cheaper mechanical pencils (and certainly much more expensive ones too!). I don't use mech pencils too often, but my highschool aged daughter does, and she's a big fan of these. These are just like any of the other BIC mechanical pencils, except for the fact that they're colored to match students' #2 pencils.As a writer and occasional doodler, I'm a huge nerd in the world of pencils. Well,  there are no more dull pencils to sharpen with this BIC student choice mechanical pencil. Thus I'm stuck with automatic pencils that have fine leads that always seem to break. I had to give these pencils 5 stars because they actually work. I guess the only negative about these pencils is that they appear to be made of plastic and are disposable. But the mechanical pencils are probably better for kids in school as it is easier just to click the top when the lead gets low instead of using a pencil sharpener, if you even have a sharpener handy. Turns out these pencils are awesome! Much, much better than more expensive mechanical pencils. With other mechanical pencils, I've broken the lead often, especially with the smallest diameter leads. "When the pencils arrived, though, the first thing I noticed was that the case was made of plastic, not wood. So let's focus on the pencils themselves.It was my first time experimenting with a 0.9" mechanical pencil, and I had not expected the size of the lead to make a discernable difference. I tend to be pretty heavy-handed with mechanical pencils, constantly breaking tips, but that wasn't much of a problem here. But when I used these pencils for sketching, it was great for shading - I found the pencil easy to control and it blended well. These BIC pencils simply take things to a new level. Like most mechanical pencils the lead inside is advanced by pressing on the eraser and can be retracted back into the pencil when you're done. The pencils are lightweight and fairly inexpensive for a mechanical pencil (although wood pencils will always be lower cost). These are great mechanical pencils that solve the basic problem we've had to date: easily broken leads. I personally abhor "regular" pencils in my home because my children spend a good half hour sharpening their pencils either manually or with the electric sharpener.

However, I'm not so sure one of these pencils  will last as long as 2 and 1/2 traditional wood pencils.

That being said, I do like these pencils and would look for them the next time I purchase economy mechanical pencils.

These are the pencils that I handed out this year for our state standardized tests.
