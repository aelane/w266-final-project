I do keep my phone close to the basestation, within a couple of feet.- There are three phones, so I can place them in key locations in my house.- It doesn't beep when it loses a connection to my phone. After using this phone set for a few months, these are things I like:- Having three handsets with their own chargers to spread around the house is nice. I received this phone for free. As a free phone it is great. And really I mostly use the phone to call out, not to receive calls, so that's not a necessary feature for me.Battery life is good! Otherwise I don't recommend these phone for people who use a cordless phone a lot. Get another phone system that is cheaper without that feature.As the sticker on the box clearly says, your cell phone must be INCHES away from the phone base. This phone is super easy, you can access and listen the voice-mail from any handset.The handsets are small and light weight, but do not feel cheap. This phone is fantastic; highly recommended! I really wanted to like the Motorola DECT 6.0 Cordless phone as I loved the idea of being able to convergemy cell phone calls to my home phone. When talking on the phone, I feel a bit like I'm talking in an echo chamber. As a basic phone system, this works perfectly. With Motorola every individual phone can retrieve voice messages, instead of only having the message stored on one base unit. But for a basic phone this works just fine.
