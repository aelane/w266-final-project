First thing I like about this printer is that you can load two different paper drawers for photos and documents. They pretty much say the same thing, but if you're a beginner you might feel more comfortable having the both sets of instructions verify each other.Now for the printing tests...I also have an Epson Workforce 840, and an Epson Artisan 837. It was quite possibly the easiest thing I've ever set up and I love that the wireless was so easy since that can sometimes be tricky. Granny does not know a thing about printing pictures, much less how to get them off the digital camera we gifted her with. The only thing missing from this little gem is the fax function, which if you need that you'll want to step up a model. Another great thing is Epson makes all 5 of the Claria inks in XL sizes, so you save a lot of money over time. One thing I noticed upon first using the printer, as I had to choose ALL PAPER TYPES before printing, as it was pre-set for only one type of paper I wasn't using, and would not print until I set it to all paper types. Another thing I noticed is that this printer will only print when you remember to pull the output tray out after loading your paper. One thing that was quickly evident was this this printer is mostly plastic. This thing is a great printer for the price. I can't tell you how frustrated I am with this thing.
