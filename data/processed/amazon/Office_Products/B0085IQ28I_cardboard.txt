It's simply a cardboard box. Reinforced and solid cardboard, and with handy handles, but essentially a box. This is an attractive cardboard file. But when it comes down to it, this is just a 'pretty' overpriced cardboard box. However, it is a cardboard box so it won't hold up to a lot of beatings, but I'm happy with how well it's held up for me. It is a corrugated black patterned cardboard box for $9.99. This is a cardboard box that acts as a file for your papers. The cardboard is decent, the pattern is attractive, but it just won't stand the test of time. It's constructed of cardboard, but feels quite sturdy and in my opinion is more durable than the brittle plastic you might get from a pricier competitor.The finish is attractive enough to be visible to customers or clients in your office.What I really like is the size. While cardboard, it is pretty sturdy and I expect it will last quite some time.Using the file box allows me to quickly access the files I need when I need them and using manila folders in the file box keeps all of my paperwork organized.The file box is packaged flat, but it easily forms into a box with just a nudge here and there.I'm happy with the Smead MO File box and would recommend it. Smead's MO File Box is made from cardboard. Once expanded, you have a small cardboard box capable of holding things. This "File Box" is constructed of corrugated cardboard. So you are paying $20 for a 3in decorated cardboard box. One can purchase an optional cardboard sleeve to slip the box into. I failed to read that it was made of cardboard. This is a foldable cardboard box that can hold 750 pages, replacing a hanging file folder in a filing cabinet. Made out of cardboard it doesn't stand up to large amounts of paper very well. Lastly, this is thin cardboard. It's just cardboard and not sturdy.It pops up into shape in literally 5 seconds, but that is the ONLY positive remark can make about it.The bottom is tucked pieces of the cardboard, so it never really is flat and it WILL pop open from the weight of the papers inside, if you would try to lift it from the handle cutouts at the top.Which brings me to the "handles." It's folding cardboard. Basically, it is a cute cardboard box, perfectly sized to fit in a file cabinet. The cardboard seems durable enough and it's attractive, too, given the prize. This is a cardboard box with handles. For those of us who like to purchase overpriced cardboard, here's your chance!O
