Even thought rated for 12 sheets it try not to put more than 6 or 7at a time- what's the rush? 12 sheets is a good amount to be able to shred at one time as well. it was shred 12 sheets if you take it slowly. From 3 to 6 sheets of printer paper, the motor seemed to strain a bit. At 8 sheets, it seemed to REALLY strain. I didn't want to test it at 12 sheets, but then why, in normal use, would I put that many through any shredder I'm not a politician). Feeding open sheets, trifold paper, odd pieces, all worked well. I put in 5 sheets and the motor bogged down. I rarely need to shred 12 sheets at one time but this shredder does handle multiple sheets with ease. Shredding about 30-50 sheets of paper would fill the bin easily. Made to accept 12 sheets of paper, this AmazonBasics CROSS-CUT shredder also has a slot to accept CD's or other plastic, like credit cards. Therefore, I don't need to feed 12 sheets at once but I have been doing 3 at a time with no strain on the motor. I wouldn't put 12 sheets through it, unless it was 12 sheets of notebook paper, but it can handle at least 6 sheets of credit card statements (since they are slightly thicker than regular paper). It really will handle 12 sheets at the same time with absolutely no problem. It cannot really do 12 sheets reliably at all.Also, the top part (the motor) is a bit heavy and cumbersome to have to lift off in order to empty the bin, which you have to do often. It won't handle 12 sheets well-it seriously bogs down, but 5-10 are no problem.
