If, however, you want to produce fancier labels than the built-in software can handle, then you can install the supplemental software onto your PC's hard drive. If you make LOTS of labels this printer well almost certainly be worth it for you, your family, or office.5 stars! The labels are said to be good for outdoor use, but I haven't had the chance to try that claim out yet.You'll need to get additional tape pretty soon; the role it comes with isn't too long. All of the labels I have made are still in great condition. If you're going to be making mostly text labels, buy a portable P-touch. The labels on my file cabinets needed updating so I decided to give this Brother a shot. These laminated labels are durable and continued to stick after freezing (although applied to dry, room temp surface), which could be applicable to home freezer or restaurant usage as well.Edit: Microsoft Plug-ins/Optional PC SoftwareI am less than delighted with the plug-ins. I anticipated being able to format labels for my needs (I print about 30 at a time) and update only the fields (like date and an ID number) that change. You can print 5 of all labels or 1 of all labels, but not independently control them and have them print all at once (to save on the "extra" label it spits out). I like neat labels and have one of the hand held labelers. If I  want labels in a snap, I just use the device's built-in software (it does not reside in the PC). I created about 10 very professional looking labels in about 15 minutes. You will also find you are limited to 1" wide (or smaller) labels -- which just don't cut it for most needs nowadays.Let me turn the tables again and say that if you work in an office, this may be ideal for you. If you constantly find yourself printing labels for file folders, or printing out barcodes for inventory purposes, this guy may be the workhorse you need. It can print larger labels at faster speeds and the per label cost is less over time (TZ tape is not cheap, and the QL-500 uses rolls of labels which tend to work out to be more cost effective).To sum it up, there is nothing wrong with this nifty little label maker. Therefore, if you print 12 labels, you just wasted a whole foot of tape. Some labels are "acid free", so scrap bookers will find them useful. The labels attach to most materials.The label material comes on a tape that one loads into the label maker.

I was really surprised that the labels still stuck after I had thoroughly wet the adhesive (though I had to wipe off the water first).

Considering that most labels I intend to make are 1-2 inches long, this is a very high proportion of waste.

Unless you are constantly printing labels on a daily basis then its overkill.
