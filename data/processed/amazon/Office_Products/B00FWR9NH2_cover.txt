We could put a nice cover page in the clear pocket on the front, and this one even has a clear pocket on the back also, where you can put something that is really important for others to see, such as, for example, the demographic information showing exactly who is buying all that advertising and how much they spend as consumers.In this case, I will be using these pockets for my receipts I collect in my business. If you need to be able to put a cover sheet or information along the spine, this notebook is a solid choice. Time will tell if the cover not transferring toner will be worth anything at all. The cover is already showing signs of folding faults in the cardboard that show through the poly-pro cover. They are transparent so you can easily see what's inside.Easy to design your own cover. The cover is durable. The cover does have that wrinkled look. I feel that the cover is stiff enough to hold up, also. The cover itself does not seem very strong.This seems suitable for organizing some papers that you might want to keep together, but not for a notebook you would use frequently.The price at this time is much higher than my local office supply store sells it for.

The cover, overall, appears to be a large step above most other binders.

There is a plastic cover over the back and front so you can insert coversheets.

The cover is fairly sturdy, but I doubt it will stand up to my high school children's habits-stuff it into the backpack with half a dozen other things, shove into a locker and dump on the floor.
