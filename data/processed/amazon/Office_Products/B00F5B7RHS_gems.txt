The gems tend to slide around a bit when you first press them on, so press firmly straight onto the stapler. The colored gems are also much sparklier than the clear ones. You have to be very careful when removing the gems or the adhesive doesn't come off with the gem and just stays on the plastic sheet.I quickly realized that the difficulty of properly adhering the gems outweighed my need for an excessively sparkly stapler. The gems were stuck onto the plastic sheet in rows, and each row had one, long, sticky piece of adhesive backing underneath. With 200 gems, I could do almost any design on my stapler.Eagerly, I tried to peel off a gem. So I simply took off the gems and their backing separately and then stuck them together again when sticking them to the stapler. Several of the gems were gone from the stapler! The little gems were now scattered on the table under the area where I had turned it over in my hands. If you intend to throw out the gems and only use the stapler, yes.

The little gems are cute, but sometimes the sticky backing does not stay on the gems when you peel them off, so they are unusable.

The gems are pretty and in pastelish colors.

I question whether or not the gems will stay on with repeated use, and the only way to know that is with a long period of use, so I will update some time down the road.
