So far I've generated numerous prints in sizes 4X6 and 8X10 only, printing images captured with a non-professional Sony Cybershot camera and using mostly the HP photo paper I have on hand. Black and white prints are equally impressive and exceptional.My conclusion about the Pixma Pro 1 is that it may well be aimed at users above the amateur level owing to its cost of operation- a set of ink will be quite expensive to replace. I've never seen my B&W; prints look so good outside of a darkroom, subtle small differences in clouds, for example, come out just perfect, and black is really black.To the details:  It took me about two hours total to set up the printer and start using it. I've printed about 25 4X6, 10 5X7, 10 8X10, 5 11X14, and 5 13X19 prints since then and the ink levels do not seem to have dropped any further. However, if you really want prints you can sell, display in galleries and art fairs, and even in local establishments, the expense is more of an investment, well worth the money.Update 7/4/2012 -  I went ahead and switched the printer to an ethernet cable connected to a router. After printing about 6 more large prints (11X14 and 13X19)  I checked the ink levels this morning and now all of the cartridges show 50%. If I'm going to continue to use it, I'll have to batch up prints to be made and do them all at once. I am struggling to get good prints with this printer. The prints are incredible. Canon says prints in albums will last 200 years; prints on the wall will last 70 years. I've gotten probably 30 prints out of it total. If I only get 30 prints per tank set, I am definitely getting rid of this printer, despite the amazing results. If you've ever wondered why prints are so expensive, this is why. It's supposed to be really good for black and white prints because it has multiple black tanks. I recently reviewed the Canon PIXMA PRO-100 and was delighted with the prints, however, comparing the same prints done on the PIXMA PRO-1, there was a definition and depth of color that exceeded the PIXMA PRO-100.
