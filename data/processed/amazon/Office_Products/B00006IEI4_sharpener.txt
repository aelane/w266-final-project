Great sharpener! But I suppose that could be because I wasn't used to operating an electric sharpener. The sharpener is large and powerful and in the short time that I've used it has been fine. And the sharpener is adjustable for several different size pencils including the fat primary ones. I sent this sharpener to the "Doctor" two times and the last time it almost didn't make it back. I can't recommend this sharpener. This sharpener is meant to last and withstand some abuse. This sharpener makes a terrific gift! This sharpener is exactly how it's described: Heavy Duty.A rotating dial allows you to insert a variety of different sized pencils, including colored pencils.

I bought this sharpener because we have a large collection of very thick color pencils which require the largest hole on this sharpener to sharpen.

This sharpener works fine.However, I was rather surprised by its large size.

I've had this sharpener for 3 years, but I never let my students sharpen their own pencils.
