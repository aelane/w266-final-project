This is a very comfortable pen to hold and to use, as the point moves with unusual smoothness. I wasn't impressed with this pen. This is a striking pen with just a touch of whimsy in the snakeskin print that encircles the tip. It's not a high-end pen, but you shouldn't expect a high-end pen at this price point. I love this pen, aside from looking really good, this pen has a nice weight to it, and it writes very smoothly. A classy pen: plump and easy to grip, matte black with a subtle band of crocodile texture around the center and silver clip and tip. This pen writes better, but I prefer the feel and look of the handmade pens. I love this pen! It is a good pen just not for me. It's a big pen but not too heavy with a medium tip and no rubber grip but my husband likes it just for those reasons, it is easy to twist to lower the writing tip so no clips on it. I say &#34;did&#34; because this Pilot pen is so smooth and luxurious that it has gone missing (read: someone STOLE it). You can now begin using the pen. With those you only need to dip the pen into the ink and screw the converter (moving the piston up)end so that you always have a full converter. Love, love this pen! Otherwise it looks like a premium pen and has garnered me a few compliments when I've pulled it out to use it. I like this pen! The pen has an attractive appearance. This pen is very difficult to hold because it is slippery and you can't grip it well. This new Pilot pen didn't have that kind of immediate "wow" factor for me, but it is a pretty solid performer. It's hard to explain since the pen doesn't appear to be broken, but the twist mechanism just didn't hold up very well.I've also found that, although this pen definitely performs better than a cheap ballpoint, I've used quite a few pens that write better as well.Overall, if you're looking for a stylish pen for light usage, I think this pen is probably a perfect choice. This is a very substantial pen. This is my new favorite pen. This is a heavy, well &#8211;made pen. At first, I assumed the pen was pre-filled and the ink cartridge was to be used to refill it. Love this pen on a number of counts. This pen has a solid feeling in the hand. I don't think you can go too wrong with this pen. I really love this pen. I was excited to get this pen, being a big fan of fountain pens generally, and classy, attractive ones in particular. This pen goes further still: the stylish metal body makes it an attractive accessory. It's not terrible but it seems like it doesn't match the pen to me.The ink comes out smooth and fine. It's a smooth pen, but does smudge on occasion. I like the pen and use it every day as it is a very comfortable and stylish writing pen. Ever since I was small and could write, I have loved a good pen. This pen is perfect. It's not too fancy, but a little more than I'd expect from a $14 pen. Twisting the pen is very fluid, and can be done so easily with one hand. If they had the whole pen with the same design, or even just the top or bottom portion, I think it would've looked better. This is a pretty good pen, overall quite beautiful.The one drawback would be its weight.Just a bit hefty for a standard pen.But otherwise a unique and pleasant design. I've thus far used only Private Reserve Inks in this pen and have been extremely satisfied.This fountain pen is not a true gold color, but more like a bronze. Included in this particular pen is a medium nib which is finer than other pens. Since the pen I received was a free sample, it arrived inside a plastic bag with a little advertising sheet, displayed in a very nice box which contained the pen, cartridge (also in a plastic bag) and the converter engaged within the pen. I first flushed the pen with water using the converter as I do with all new fountain pens, allowed it to dry overnight, then filled it with the Private Reserve Ink in the shade of Avacado. This pen was not designed (or priced) as a collectible item. It is intended to be used as an everyday writing instrument.The pen did not come with instructions, so if you are not savvy, you might need a little instructions on how to use the pen. The pen comes with a disposable ink cartridge. It's apparent instantly that the pen is crafted as the weight of each end feels right for one's grip. Writing with this pen is smooth, easy, and allows for more expression than the usual ballpoint pen. The pen comes in a gift-type box, and this is where I have a little quibble. A pen that needs ... instructions? I would say I love the pen, but I don't, exactly. This is a great pen. I love the pen and wish it were available in more designs. If I were to spend $15+ on a pen, it would have to be pretty spectacular. Love this pen. The pen is a good weight, high quality, and the animal print band is subtle enough to look expensive. The pen has a large enough barrel to making gripping comfortable, even with extended writing. This is now my go-to pen for letter writing and journaling. To be honest, it's just a pen and not all that special. The pen has a matte finish. It&#8217;s definitely not a pen you&#8217;re going to want to loan out. The pen has a very nice chrome satin finish.The python accent print is sublime, not too noticeable.But when you look at it close, it looks good.The writing instrument is not &#34;high-class&#34; like Montblanc or &#34;Water---&#34; but it writes no less smooth or elegantly.The refill is also very reasonably priced.At under $20, these makes wonderful gifts for any occasion. This is an elegant and sexy pen that is leagues above your standard rollerball. It appears to be a gel pen. Honestly, I couldn't write for very long with this pen before my hand got tired. This is not your usual Pilot pen found in most stores. This is a pretty nice pen. I like to write with a pen that feels like an instrument - AND writes well. The pen's balance is good and comfortable in your hand, light weight but also sturdy and substantial. This pen will not get lost in your briefcase.My only complaint is the Animal design and coloration. Overall a great pen from the writing perspective and recommended. This pen is really elegant and has a executive feel to it. Overall, it's a lovely pen, and the lizard print accent enhances it, making it look more expensive, as opposed to cheap.The nib here writes just as well as any of my Mont Blanc or Waterman pens do, although I do have to admit to being partial to fine points, so my experience writing with a medium point is limited. This pen would be perfect to give the new attorney or doctor. *The pen is light (weight wise) and easy to hold. Anyway, this pen is wonderful for writing checks and signing important documents.CONS*This pen does not come with directions about how to load the ink. If I had a really expensive pen, this might not be the case, so I was eager to try this pen so see what a relatively inexpensive pen could do. If you plan to fill the pen from an ink bottle, leave the insert in. A very attractive pen that is also comfortable to hold and writes well. This is a really beautiful pen. This pen made the rounds, took abuse from a few people, and was undamaged. This pen is perfectly comfortable to hold. This pen is perfectly adequate -- it writes smoothly and is comfortable in hand. and the pen doesn't have the heft that really nice pens have, that feel of something substantial. This is a really attractive pen--looks like the picture. But I'm sorry to report that the pen I got skips. With this pen I have to really concentrate to keep a steady pressure in order to write without skipping. What I want most in a pen is a combination of two things. I want the pen to write smoothly, and I want the pen to feel comfortable in my hand, preferably so comfortable that I forget it's there. This pen comes fairly close. But this pen has written immediately every time I've used it: no scribbling on a piece of scratch paper to get it going. (When the pen's not in use, the cap fits snugly.) Ive been using this pen for about a week now. I must admit this pen writes BETTER than any Montblanc I own.It is extremely smooth writing, hefty, high quality, and looks great. I highly recommend this pen! I was pleasantly surprised upon receiving this pen in the mail. The pen is of a nice weight, and feels comfortable writing. Included with the pen are a disposable ink cartridge, as well as a squeeze bladder cartridge you can refill with your own ink. I do prefer a pen with a little more heft, but with there is good balance to this when the cap is on the back. Reviewing a pen is like reviewing toilet paper.T
