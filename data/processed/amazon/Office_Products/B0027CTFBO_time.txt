Every time we have moved or helped someone else move, it seems they always come up short on boxes or more often short on packing tape. But, somehow, I know that this will be the last time these boxes will disappoint. I will see to it.It's probably time to explain the reason behind my conclusion that these boxes were build to deliver:- They are large and roomy. I can see how these could save time and money.As far as sturdiness- I was impressed with the feel of the assembled box- the bottom felt sturdy and reinforced, the sides sturdy enough and the fold over flaps offered a little extra hand cushioning to the built in handles.If assembling a cross-country move or one involving longer term storage I would probably use tape or something else to cover the handles- as I would be concerned about stowaways if warehoused or in transit for a long time.I am using these to pack up books we aren't using and art supplies- and they are perfect for stacking on the top shelf of our shelving unit/storage closet. The only time I might use tape with these boxes is if I had a bunch of very small items (e.g. I thought at the time that they were the perfect moving boxes, but these Fellowes boxes are even better.The boxes are very simple to put together and only take about 10 seconds each. Only time will tell how they hold up. These Fellowes Moving Boxes are such a time saver compared to regular moving boxes you have to spend time and effort taping together. Even the first time I assembled one, it did not seem quite square, or to fit quite right.Still, a good idea for an alternative to taped boxes. They are still useable for a third time. Great for moving and saving time; also easy to store. They work great do take your time though and really figure out how to assemble them before you start.They are very sturdy and easy to use perfect for what i got them for. They are made to last a long time. That's a time saver, and who wants to waste time while packing?There are perforated punch-outs on two sides of the box for ease of carrying heavy loads. Every time I would pick up a plastic bin, the lid would always fall off. Most of the time my luck runs out and I go out and purchase a very expensive plastic bin that takes up way to much space. In the mean time, there is an empty plastic container just taking up space.

I use "Banker's Boxes" all the time, and just assumed these "Moving Boxes" would be the same type of thing.

This time, I received these Fellowes Moving Boxes just in time for another relocation.

I will buy these any time I need storage.
