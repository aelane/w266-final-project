I especially like the purple ink. The ink flows smoothly. Very easy and comfortable for me to hold and write with.The ink flows smoothly and the colors show up bright and clear on paper and light colored cardboard. The ink (especially on the pink pen) is light and hard to read on some surfaces, but flows nicely.I would say it's something your grade-schooler (or grandma) would love, but then there were my co-workers. The ink quality is what you would expect from a BIC, meaning it's nice and smooth. But pink ink doesn't come across as very professional in an office and can't be used on a fax. I haven't found a purple ink to write with with for 30 years. I have never had a pink ink pen before. I had to laugh that these are called "BIC for Her"... because frankly, I prefer blue or black ink. The purple ink is okay, but the pink ink is a bit too pale for my taste. The ink colors are pure and it's so nice to not have to worry about the ink smudging if you barely touch it. I happen to like purple ink as an alternative to blue or black. The ink color matches the pen color. The ink colors are vibrant, and you can easily see both the purple and pink ink when you write with them. The ink flow is smooth and is quick to dry. I was expecting the ink to be black, but the colors were a vibrant pink and purple. They are attractive to look at and they write well, and the ink is easy to read. The ink starts flowing the instant it hit the paper (no scribbling, just to get a new pen to start writing). The ink is smooth with no clumping and the pen is lightweight with a great rubber grip to make writing comfortable. But now I just want the ink to be black or blue so I can use it at work as well as at home. I found the BIC for Her Fashion pens nice to use; the ink colors are pretty and the pen is comfortable to hold. The ink flows smoothly and shows up nicely on the paper. The ink is the color of the pen and although the end grippy part is a little more rubbery for a good grip, it is not squishy or more comfortable to hold. The ink colors match the pens and are bright and clear.
