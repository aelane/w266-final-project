I scanned a photo at 12000 dpi, it came out really well. I know this isn't meant to be a photo printer, but I was still disappointed because the print is much darker than the original and looks dull. I will keep my other photo printers for that task.Double Sided Scanned Prints:  Now I especially like this feature. On premium photo paper, the prints are professional. I scanned a photo and a document just to test it, and it was not only fast but the file it created was clear and true.As with all refill cartridges, I'm shocked by the price - I could only find these at Staples, and the Cyan/Yellow/Maroon pack is $65. It also makes it easy to switch between photo and document standing -- just one button to switch.For the Epson, it all has to be done on the computer and in several steps. Though not a dedicated photo printer, with the right Epson print paper (for photos), I found this printer did a very good job. Color photo print quality was good but not as fast as expected, it also was darker than expected. Instead of having a separate photo printer and separate scanner/printer, everything fits into this one machine that just sits in my corner. I tried a 4x6 photo, and it jammed while scanning via the ADF. I also own one of Epson professional photo printers - so I have a long term experience with Epson.As usual it does everything a modern all in one usually has - software and installation went very nicely I do follow the directions as it saves time and avoids problems.It is worth the price if one does more than casual printing.
