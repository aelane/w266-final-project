Epson Connect is great for wireless scanning, and I'm ok with that, but if I want more control over what I'm scanning, I have to use the Epson Scan software. I replaced a worn-out HP Officejet 4500 All-in-One wireless with this Epson WF 2540 Wireless All-in-One printer. I'm extremely pleased with these but every wireless device will not function for me. This is my first "wireless" printer. So we were looking for a small-footprint wireless printer. I chose wireless. Network, wireless and speed is good. I was able to set it up on my wireless network with a moderate amount of fiddling around (for initial setup, you're better off with a direct connection). Epson's WorkForce WF02540 is a wireless printer which is great for mobile devices like a smartphone or tablet. This all in one is replacing an HP 8000 wireless printer. This all-in-one Epson wireless printer does that.

The wireless was so easy to set up and I thought it was going to be a hassle.

They are consistently reliable, easy to set up, wireless, fast, nice looking prints (photos included), and relatively quiet.

Very simple set up with wireless networks (though the set up has a stupid instruction to disconnect the USB cable, and then 1 minute later is telling you that it can't register without the cable connected; someone should have proof read/corrected the program instructions).
