The printer takes up a large amount of physical space when it's paper feeding slide outs (front and rear) are open so be aware you will need more than average space for this printer. It's as though you can very quickly "unfold" the printer when you go to use it and "fold it back up" when you are done using it.The paper feeding is excellent. The printer acts as though it is doing unauthorized print head cleanings. The printer appears to be doing head cleanings on its own or automatically. So I'm sure the printer is doing head cleanings on its own and dumping huge amounts of ink in the process. I don't know how the printer decides when to do print head cleanings. I will have to get rid of the printer. This printer belongs in the dumpster or in a recycling center. This printer uses cartridges with such chips. This Canon printer has the chips on the outside of the cartridge, but the printer is still the worst waste of money, time and energy and suffering that I've been through with just any product I can remember. Right now it looks like this printer might be heading for the recycling center.I'm thinking of buying a cheap black and white laser printer so I'll at least have something to print with if I have to make a copy of a document or print an important document for some reason. Have been using this printer for a couple of months. This Canon printer is better than any H.P. printer that have owned and I have been using H.P. However, if you are replacing a printer, as I was, then just use the cable from the old printer. So if you get the printer, I would recommend downloading the updates for the software. There's not much to say about this printer. The printer itself looks pretty good, shiny black finish, and the paper handling plastic trays seemed reasonably strong to withstand normal (careful) handling.Although this is an inexpensive printer and is aimed at the business, rather than home photo, market, the image quality on photographic prints is quite good. The printer is designed well. This small and stylish printer is exactly what I needed for the office. It is extremely important considering that this is not a Wi-Fi printer, no cable=no printing. The best printer I have ever owned. A versatile printer for a creative artist. If you are looking for a printer that will get the job done, without the need to call IT support technician, this is the one for you. There isn't much to this printer in terms of features that can confuse or irritate you. The printer is large so be prepared to receive a large box, however don't let the size fool you.
