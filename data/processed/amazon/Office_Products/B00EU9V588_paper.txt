You can use regular paper or photo paper. The paper drawer just slides on the desk. There are two paper trays. Then I couldn't figure out how to put the paper in the tray. I placed the paper I wanted to copy to the far left, where I have always done so on any all in one printer or copy machine. I have not been able to test it with Epson photo paper yet, but will amend this review once I get a chance to. There are 2 paper trays for various sizes paper or envelopes etc.With the 610's small footprint and excellent quality printing it would be hard to find a better mid priced printer.I am very satisfied so far. I have had no paper jams to date. Second, I was disappointed that the main paper tray holds only 100 sheets of paper. That is not very much paper and so if you do a moderate amount of printing you will be reloading the paper tray often. Plain paper prints look washed out, premium paper prints look good. Loading paper was easy and the instructions were very easy to follow. We have the Canon MG-5400 and it's great for paper printing and scanning, but it doesn't allow much flexibility as far as printing on discs, which is why I wanted it -- with all the downloadable recordings nowadays, I have to make my own packaging (it's not as good to just write on them with a Sharpie).Anyway, the Canon was limited in how much could be printed word-wise and just wasn't up to what I needed it for. It was very easy to set up except when I screwed up and thought the paper tray was in the back of the machine... that took a good 10 minutes of cursing to sink in that the lower tray wasn't, in fact, missing or jammed into the machine, but was merely on the other side.-Small footprint.-Larger ink cartridges. The paper tray holds a good stack of paper so you won't have to refill often. If you quickly deplete paper - and I figure that the full sheet tray can hold 20 sheets of standard weight multi-purpose paper at best - this is going to be a nuisance. The paper input tray doesn't hold a lot, but I find that I change media a lot on this machine, so I don't mind as much that I can't load it up with a ream of paper.The photo printing is incredible. However, I get paper jammed frequently when I print from this tray. It could be because my photo paper was too thick (I used Cannon premium glossy photo paper. It didn't damage the paper, just didn't pick it up properly. I never love upright paper trays. The paper gets dusty and takes up vertical space, but again it keeps the printer footprint down in size. The paper jammed every.

There are two paper trays, one for regular paper (8.5x11 for me), and one for photo paper (5x7 glossy for me).

You load up the paper trays and then when you print emails or web pages, it uses the regular paper but when you print photos, it uses the photo paper.

It has a small paper capacity of only 100 sheets regular paper, less if using thicker photo paper.
