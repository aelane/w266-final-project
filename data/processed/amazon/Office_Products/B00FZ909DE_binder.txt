This is your average three ring three inch binder. I really like how easily and securely this binder closes. This is a large, durable binder. The  binder uses a D ring so it is more convenient. This particular binder D rings.Overall, I'm very pleased! This is a functional, inexpensive binder that is not really intended to stand up to a lot of wear and tear. Best binder you can buy for a teenager to bring to high school! This binder is large enough to hold a couple of year's worth of documents. This is a nice, sturdy binder that seems to be constructed well. This is a very strong binder that will hold all kinds of three hole punched items with integrity. This binder can hold up to 660 sheets of paper. This binder only has two inside pockets with one on each inside cover and they are strong.The binder itself seems pretty good but I did have a few problems with it. The binder cover itself also appears to be sturdy. I open the binder and the pages are flat. I shut the binder and the pages are still flat - instead of curved.The cover and spine are thick and stand up to the test of time. Therefore, if you use the binder several time daily, as we do, this will not last more than a few months before you need to replace it. With a 3-ring binder, you often get to pick between these options: do the rings hold together if dropped, or are the rings easy to open?This one is a hold-together. When you buy a big binder the weaknesses of the binder's design become manifest right away because of the stress caused by all the weight of the paper.This binder's strength is the rings itself. This is a big binder and the extra durable is probably accurate. I am so glad I got this binder. I opened and closed the binder multiple times while sorting the papers and never had a bit of trouble and the D rings help to keep all the papers sitting in a nice stack when not being used, instead of being bent on the circle rings that most binders have. Now to track down another binder to be able to file my sewing project ideas that I download from the internet. But as with another binder I tried, the heat sealing on the extra durable hinge burned through so there are actually perforations in the hinge.While I love these binders, I am concerned about the longevity of this hinge. I was expecting more for a plain white binder which is priced as high as is the Wilson Jones Heavy Duty D-Ring View Binder. This is a very solid 3 ring binder. The binder is encased in clear plastic pockets allowing you to modify the binder with labels, a cover design, and other pertinent information. So over all I'd say it's a very practical binder that is well designed to do what binders do... nothing more, nothing less. If you haven't used a 3-inch binder before, the first thing you need to know is that this thing is huge. All in all, this isn't a terrible binder, and would work well if it's being used in a setting where you might add to it without having to constantly move it around. I have loaded up this binder with a full box of plastic sheet protectors with recipes inserted. I would not want to use this binder for school. If there ever was a binder person, that would be me. This is a BIG binder. If you're looking for a binder that will hold a large project, or multiple projects, this may be the ticket for you. This binder is very sturdy. This is a great binder. Leave it on, please.A binder that is sturdier than most, with D-rings that actually work, and interior pockets. This binder will last me a while. The binder is being used to store rubber stamps for crafts. The binder works for what we are using it for and if the binder fails in the coming months I will update my review accordinglyAs of now I would give my recommendation As it happens, I needed to get a new binder to hold my new set of course standards for one of the classes that I teach. This binder fit the bill perfectly. A binder of THIS size makes it easy to keep your space and learning/business organized and also great to have if you need to attend a conference and can carry all of your materials in one place! I think this binder will last very long. This sturdy binder is big enough to store plenty. This is a very large but light binder. But, so far this binder has worked flawlessly.My only complaint is that I found it extremely difficult to get a label inserted into the spine of the binder. This is a huge binder and it will hold a truck-load of papers. I'm quite sorry to say this binder is a big disappointment. I am a binder freak. I like this binder. For them, I have found that a flexible binder in general will make it farther though the school year. This is a solid binder, and HUGE. This binder was not as heavy as I expected. I also got a similar binder and I&#34;m not sure if the cover was damaged before or after I opened the package so be very careful opening this box when it arrives. If I had seen this binder on a Wal-Mart shelf for more than $7  I would have passed it by on looks alone. It you can get past that the binder seems very well made. The binder itself arrived with several corners bumped (even though it had been packed in a large cardboard box with inflated plastic cushions).

This D-Ring 3&#8221; binder is just the thing for this purpose.When I open the binder, the cover lays flat without my having to shift any of the pages.

without the binder breaking.

Then when you store the binder on a shelf, you will know which binder has what in it.Is a binder on your &#8220;needs&#8221; list?
