Very seldom can one find four notebooks in one pack for this price.Terrific deal for students, journalists, poets, and anyone who keeps a personal journal. As expected, these Mead notebooks are good quality and perfect for my elementary children's school notebooks. I don't know what to say about these because they're great, lightweight notebooks. There's not much to say about spiral notebooks. These notebooks are perfect for classes or just keeping your life or bills organized.The pages don't rip out easily and they paper is a nice quality. I picked these notebooks up primarily for my youngest daughter who is a writer. The notebooks are very flimsy so she can not hold them and write she must put them on the desk/table to use them.2. I was wanting to find some notebooks to fill up with Japanese Kanji practice, and these fit the bill. What can I say about notebooks? The notebooks are made for one class and not meant to be used beyond that. I like to have some cheap notebooks around for when I get a story idea kicking around in my head or when I want to write a rant on some issue of the day. These notebooks are useful and inexpensive.I'm often jotting down work related notes during phone conversations or scribbling notes during meetings.It's handy to keep one of these on my desk instead of a stack of loose papers.I can close it when not in use and it looks neater and makes it easier for me to find the notes when I need them.The pages tear out easily, but they aren't perforated to come out with a straight edge.Nice colors in case someone wants to use all of them at once for different subjects. These notebooks are great for those purposes. When it comes to spiral notebooks, I can't get excited about style - just function. I remember growing up using Mead notebooks at school. Well, the notebooks haven't really changed. The Mead wide ruled spiral notebooks makes jotting down the essentials easier. The notebooks are conveniently 3-hole punched to allow individual notebooks to be stored in 3-ring binders. These notebooks are fine. These particular notebooks have wide-ruled paper (25 useable writing lines per page).I like having different color covers, because I can easily find the notebook I am searching for. However, I know that the notebooks would last throughout a term, and suspect they would last a semester. They were not really any different, better, or worse than the spiral notebooks from this company that I have used in the past. Spiral notebooks are back to school essential specifically spiral notebooks of different colors for particular subjects. These Mead notebooks, thankfully, contain normal paper that behaves as expected.The back cover, however, feels thinner than it once was, which is fine if you are using it on a desk, but if you want to set it on your knee and write, you may miss having that firm back cover.The pages aren't perforated, so if you tear them out, you won't have a nice straight edge. These are exactly what I thought they would be:  cheap, wide-ruled, single-subject notebooks. These are typical spiral notebooks without perforations which is fine with my son who said he doesn't neet to tear the pages out of the notebooks. These are nice, inexpensive notebooks that come in a four pack. I've been using these notebooks for years and years, as a student and later as a businessman and nowadays to write rough drafts when I'm away from a computer. I like these notebooks for use around the house. It's hard to get excited about notebooks, yet my daughter actually loved these. You can certainly get no-name notebooks at cheaper prices from various sources, but they will probably be filled with lesser paper and won't be as sturdy. Mead spiral notebooks are a classic from when I was in grade school. The notebooks hold together nicely, but also ben to fit into a smaller bag or purse, without cracking or breaking. Good notebooks, as usually from Mead. These are spiral notebooks. They work as all of the other Mead spiral notebooks I have used. The notebooks are SFI certified, which means the materials came from sustainable forests. I have four older Mead spiral notebooks, two wide ruled, and two college ruled, and I have to say that the quality of the paper has remained high. As soon as I looked at these notebooks, I noticed that the horizontal lines aren't very dark making it difficult to take notes in lower light. I compared the new notebooks to the older notebooks, and, indeed, the lines aren't as dark. I checked all four of the notebooks I received thinking it might be a printing error, but it's the same for all of them.Mead has always been my go to for quality notebooks. These 70-sheet notebooks are reasonably priced and get the job done, but are very basic. They are good, basic notebooks for school (70 pages is more than enough room for most subjects), household information, creative writing, or just about any other use you can think of. But these Mead notebooks are SFI-certified (Sustainable Forestry Initiative) which means that the paper in them is made with sustainable materials and processes. They are the run-of-the-mill notebooks that everyone used to use in school--not the &#34;fancy&#34; ones out now. Honestly, I still prefer the simple notebooks like these. You really can't go wrong with these notebooks. These notebooks are like the ones I regularly use and I&#8217;ve been happy with them.
