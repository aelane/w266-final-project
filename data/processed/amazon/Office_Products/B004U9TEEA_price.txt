Reasonable price too. If it was full price I probably would not buy. I would definitely recommend them and you can't beat the current price. For the price this set is a fantastic deal. Not a bad price I guess.I plan to use some of the more sedate colors for my regular writing. For the price of under 3 bucks, they really are a decent deal if you want colored pens.Some of these wrote smoothly, but others skipped and were a bit more scratchy. Still, for the price, I was mostly pleased. For the price, this is a good set of pens. Despite the low price tag (under $5) the pens are not cheaply made. The price cannot be beat, $2.78 for seven pens. For the price, I think they are a a good value. For the price, they can't be beaten. For the price, this definitely cannot be beat.
