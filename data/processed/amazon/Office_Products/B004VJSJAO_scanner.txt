Very nice looking scanner! This scanner has a nice small footprint and looks good on my desk.More importantly, the Kodak i2600 has drivers for Windows XP Pro, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8. This scanner produces high quality results and works without jamming in most circumstances. This scanner also processes mixed thicknesses of paper without having to sort and separate. This scanner is right for a doctor's office that handles several doctors, to give one example.Flatbed scanner accessory - Forget it. This scanner is fast almost beyond belief. By then the scanner paid for itself anyway.What it's like scanning hundreds of pounds of documents - I've done it once. This is a very good scanner for small office, or for people with quite some scanning needs at home. While the scanner was not terribly difficult to setup, the installation guide (basically a quick start pamphlet) could have been clearer as I was not sure if I needed to install the software first or just put the CD in, plug the scanner in, and let it work its magic via plug and play. The scanner and software does crop the photos automatically. I would give the scanner itself 5 stars and the documentation and support 2 stars. Overall, I recommend the scanner.

Purchased this scanner to replace an aging Visioneer scanner that I used for the office.

Even though the scanner has pretty good default settings, I still needed to tweak a few things to optimize the scans.

I almost returned the scanner and bought another brand.
