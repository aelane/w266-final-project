I use binders for my crafts, keeping cut out fashion magazine pages, coupons, and college classes. Well, I can say this much...I do use binders because of loose-leaf books that are sent to me for use or review. I work with binders frequently at work, and they get a lot of wear and tear from removing papers constantly, and refilling them back up. I have seven of these binders in varying thickness and all of them are excellent choices for holding important presentations and documentation.This is marketed as having Extra Durable Hinges and they are indeed quite sturdy compared to the lower end binders we buy in bulk. These are perfect sized binders for storing an assortment of papers I use for my research. I recently picked up some less expensive binders for a project I haven't completed yet so I was able to compare this one to similar binders that cost less.As others have mentioned, the D-Ring has benefits over the circular ring.Less jamming of papers is one of them.I found the rings easy to open and seem to stay closed better than the rings on the less expensive binders.My less expensive binders had inside pockets and outside covers that allow you to insert paper to customize it.I'm using these binders with various pocket pages to organize my garden seeds.After seeing the method at a gardening forum, I decided to work on storing my seeds this way.Seeds like beans and peas are being stored in tins, but the majority of my open pollinated seed collection will be tucked into the plastic sleeves that have pockets. Most binders are knocked around, but I believe that mine get more knocking around than most.Another question that's tied into the durability question would be, "Is it worth the price?" Many binders will only open so far and the spine begins to break.Another thing I very much like about it are the pockets. I've had binders from the Wilson Jones brand before, and I can't say this one is my favorite or anything. This is one of the flimsiest binders I've ever used. The white binders come in all sizes and are primarily intended for storage. I've owned several of these binders in the past. Most ordinary binders in my office--the ones used for storage--have broken after a few years. I do like D-ring binders rather than round rings (and this type does have the central pin, which is nice). I prefer the zippered binders for students because no matter how jam packed they are, they don't fly open. These are really nice binders. I have long preferred D-ring binders to O-ring ones. Both binders are constructed to lay entirely flat.Prices obviously vary tremendously depending on where your make your purchase. I have been using Wilson Jones binders for years and I dont think I have gotten a bad one in the lot! I also like that these binders come with a full year guarantee. I ordered several Wilson Jones binders at the same time and found the quality to be uneven. I have 2 of these binders in the 1" option. Both of my binders came with a couple bubbles under the surface that aren't the end of the world but for a "Heavy Duty" binder with these claims you'd think they'd be in perfect condition.I also have other Wilson Jones Heavy Duty Binders in some of the other colors and they are very nice and bold. When purchasing binders, one needs to consider the use you have intended for them.W
