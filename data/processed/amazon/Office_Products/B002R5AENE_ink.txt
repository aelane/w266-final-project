The ink doesn't dry quickly at all, but remains very easily and messily smeared for minutes after writing. ink that prevents check washing, but they're considerably more expensive. The ink dries fast and there was no smudging.I found the pens comfortable to hold and the medium pen tip (.7mm) is perfect - I don't care for fine tip pens and I don't think a fine tip would work well for gel pens.As far as the colors of the pens, the pink and orange are very bright. The ink does not flow smoothly off the pens, but rather sticks and scratches across the paper. The ink flow smoothly, no clumping or gobbing with a nice cushioned grip.So, why only 4 stars? Because the ink tends to dry a little slower than I would like and as a southpaw I tend to smear the ink from these pens. The ink did not smear when touched. Not too fine-pointed, so you can see the writing well, but neither are they too chubby-pointed, so the ink dries quickly and smears are at a minimum. Generally when this happens it will keep happening until the ink is gone.The colors themselves are nice although the look of the pens themselves leans more towards primary school. The ink is vibrant without being too opaque, and it is very easy to read. The ink seems water resistent and dries fairly quickly.I ended up giving mine to the kids; the bright colors make them popular targets in a household environment. I don't know how long the ink will last before drying out once opened. The ink didn't skip like most of the other gel pens I've used. The ink flows smoothly and the pen itself is both comfortable to use and stylish in appearance. The ink dries quickly and does not smudge. The ink was dry or scratchy or just didn't show up.These pens fix all that.
