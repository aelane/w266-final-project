I continually try new pens, but these continue to be the most comfortable for my hand. I've used these pens randomly throughout high school and loved them. If these pens were to have a grip on them it would make these pens near perfect. The pens are made of plastic with a see through ink tube inside them; and the plastic barrel is indeed a hexagon shape (meaning that it has six sides). I always notice these pens when they show up in movies or tv shows, too. I always use these pens! These pens are similar in appearance and quality to the pens I used when I was a kid, 40 years ago. They perform much better than the cheaper pens that are everywhere today.

These pens respect principles of space, form, structure, density, and gravity.

It's not only one of the most inexpensive pens, it's also probably the most efficient pen, with a single pen able to write over 100,000 words (or about 2 novels).

Bic calls these pens "medium point" but the writing is clear and easy to read on the page.
