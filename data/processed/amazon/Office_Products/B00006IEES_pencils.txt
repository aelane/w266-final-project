These pencils used to be great. The pencils are flat black, and I think that they look special and very classy! As claimed, they do write smoother than ordinary pencils, but the difference is mostly not noticeable. I give these pencils 4 stars  because I had better. We need to make our pencils in the usa and not over seas. I would recommend these pencils! These are by far the best pencils out there. Recently got few of these pencils and they are really good.

2 HB pencils from just a couple of years ago.

Every few pencils comes one with a little paint missing up where the eraser begins; I have never known this to happen with prior generations of Black Warriors.Now I have lost my reference standard for the best made-in-USA mass-manufactured writing pencil, though my new south-of-the-border jobs sharpen well and are comfortingly black-leaded without excessive softness; they erase well because of that.

These pencils have a softer type lead but they work very well and sharpen up nicely.
