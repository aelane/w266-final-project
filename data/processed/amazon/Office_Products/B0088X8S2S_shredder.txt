We could not get the shredder to work when we first plugged it in and after reading the instruction to no avail, we called for support. While we were certainly impressed with this shredder's great performance, I think the instructions should be clearer about inserting the key and Customer Support should be made aware of this so they can actually help the customer. Even though this is a reconditioned shredder, it arrived looking brand new. This is a capable shredder that handles thick paper, CDs, and credit cards. The shredder is easy to empty, and has a reverse function to handle jams. This shredder is good-looking, and has a window so you can see the level of shredded material.You really need that window, too, because it's about level with the back of the bin. Fortunately, this shredder is on casters, so you can wheel it to disposal destination. They're very basic, and if you haven't used a shredder that has the features this one has, you'll be lost. (this is what did in my old shredder) And it has a reverse feature that will clear most jams.It also has a triple safety feature, there are three power buttons, one master switch in the back, a main button on top and a red key you can remove to keep little hands from messing with it. This shredder has been very useful. Let me first say this shredder is very heavy, about forty pounds. This shredder also has anti-jam feature and if you put your paper in wrong you can hit the reverse button and try again. The shredder is so powerful you can shred with the staples and paper clips still attached with no problem. Whew, my previous shredder was by Fellowes (Fellowes Powershred 100% Jam Prooof 79C1 14 Sheet Cross-cut Paper Shredder); and, attaching the wheels was a project so this was definitely a relief for me this time.
