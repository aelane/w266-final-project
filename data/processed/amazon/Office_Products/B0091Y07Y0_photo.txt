If not, the photo issue is irrelevant to the value.All in all, it's a 3.5 star value but still good enough to consider if you see the price drop to the $50- $60 level.Another thing... if you're considering buying a printer for a student, I strongly recommend that they ONLY print when absolutely necessary. The photo came out beautiful, right to the edges! I would say that the Epson can do just as well as Shutterfly for the casual photo enthusiast.Overall, I really like this printer. The photo tray is sturdy. The photo printing works great and the pictures I've printed have turned out well as long as I select the proper kind of paper to print them on.There are other options such as creating coloring book pages from images as well as greeting cards and you can print lined paper!The standard sized inks are fairly large individual tanks so they will probably last quite a while for me. If not, they are readily available.Summary: nice photo quality, nice for people who do brochures at home and want 2-sided color printing. The photo quality was great as well! Premium photo paper will cost extra.The dual paper cassettes are NOT identical cassettes. My Artisan I liked best for photo quality, and the Workforce is better at text. I only compared the XP-600 photo printing with my Artisan, because I already knew the Workforce was slightly inferior in that area. With regular photo setting neither printer was better or worse. I do use Epson photo papers and ink, so I'm sure that helps, but I could not be more pleased with the print quality of my photos.4. However, I will keep using my other photo printer and keep this as an emergency backup. With a photo printer, you get 6 inks- black, cyan, magenta, yellow, light cyan and light magenta. You can load 4 x 6- or 5 x 7-inch photo papers into the upper cassette, and letter-size, A4, legal, 4 x 6-, 5 x 7-, or 8 x 10-inch papers into the lower cassette.The printer was easy to set up.

And the photo print quality is AMAZING!PRINTABLE CD/DVD:  In a neat solution, this printer comes with a little tray that you can insert into the output tray and use to print directly on printable DVDs and CDs.

I wasn't expecting pristine photo reproductions but the image quality was less than what I had anticipated.
