If you need/like highlighters, these are great.Word of warning: cheaper pen ink will streak unless you wait for it to dry. These highlighters work just like any other, only without the cap to lose. I can still read through even the darkest of these highlighters, but a lighter shade of the same color would have been easier on the eyes. These retractable highlighters are far more convenient than the traditional caps. I'm not crazy about these highlighters. How can you go wrong with highlighters? Most of my past highlighters had a really tight cap (to keep them from drying) and you need to use both hands to open it and make sure to keep the cap safely. Having used these highlighters for a couple months now, I have to change my review from its previous four-star rating down to two stars. I have purchased purple Sharpie highlighters in the past which were VERY dark and nearly impossible to read the text, so these are great.My only problem with them is that they're very long, about an inch longer than the average pen/Sharpie highlighter. I love these highlighters. These highlighters are "clicky", like BIC pens. These highlighters have that exact feature. I use highlighters often for road rallies, meetings, and schoolwork. However, the smearing seems to be less than other highlighters. I think it's because these highlighters go on drier than most. I've had highlighters before that soak and wrinkle the page; these do not have that quality. I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to highlighters, but these are really great. I stopped using highlighters for a while cause most of them would bleed threw the page. These highlighters work as well as others I have tried. Some other highlighters I've used are rather dry and you have to make multiple passes to get enough ink on the paper or they feel like they are dragging. These highlighters are retractable so no misplacing marker covers only to have your marker dry out or bleed all over.They write a very thin line, which is great for writing notes on papers/charts when correcting papers, but if you are looking for a think point to draw or color, this may not work as nicely for you.The biggest con for me was that the logo imprinted on the outside of the marker seems to wear off really easily. Most highlighters die prematurely because the caps are lost or left off too long, leading the ink to dry out. Retractable highlighters, what a great idea. Time will tell if they dry out quicker than the other highlighters with the cap. With the Sharpie retractable highlighters you're just one click away from neon brilliance. I love that these highlighters come in an array of colors as well. Overall, these are fine highlighters. These are really great highlighters. These highlighters do the Sharpie name justice but some (red, navy and purple) are much too dark to be highlighters. These are retractable highlighters that are closed via a "safety seal" when retracted so the highlighters don't dry out. I was skeptical about these retractable highlighters. These highlighters hold the name up well.The colors are bright and varied. These are a little too dark for highlighters. The highlighters are also really wet. An 8-pack of highlighters in multiple colors that works exactly as advertised is what you'll get. These highlighters come in a fun variety of colors of red, hot pink, bright orange, fluorescenct yellow, green, turquoise, royal blue and lilac purple within the resuable clear pack. The Sharpie Accent Retractable highlighters are really convenient to keep on hand. I find the highlighters to not smear any ink once once the pen ink is fully dried, unlike some other highlighters that seem to have a solvent quality about them that will smear many inks even after drying, so kudos to Sharpie for the virtually smear-proof properties of these highlighters. These highlighters come in a nice reusable pouch. These are highlighters so I can't go on and on about them, but they took the Accent brand quality and combined it with the easier to hold shape of the Sharpie which makes it easy to use and hold.

The highlighters arrive in a nice little plastic storage case.

With highlighters, I would think that you choose a variety of light shades, so as to not put a dark color over a black font to make it more difficult to read.

My current highlighters are about 4.2mm, which I like better.SMEARINGThe marketing of these highlighters seems to be focused on the fact that these have "SMEAR GUARD Technology."
