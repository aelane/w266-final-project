So why have a small pad of labels you can't run through a printer?Well, because they are just the thing when you want to slap a quick mailing label on something and don't want to go to the trouble of launching a software program and loading labels in a printer and test printing and reprinting etc., etc.It can often just be faster and handier to grab this pad, write the label out by hand, peel the label from the pad, peel off the back, slap it on the package and send it off.And the pad takes up a lot less room on the desktop or in the drawer than a full sheet of printer mailing labels. They come in a neat pad attached together at the top, and just the right size for most applications.The labels are easy to write on (pen does not skip like it may on some other type of paper), and they stick well with edges staying down and not curling up.This is a great product if you need to create one or two shipping labels and are in a hurry, but if you need to ship a bunch of stuff, printer labels would be a much better solution. This pad of address labels, though conveniently packaged as a pad from which you can tear off one label at a time, does neither; "From" is separated from "To" by a thin light blue line and must be cut apart. This is a nice little pad of adhesive shipping labels. The pad is small enough to fit into a drawer or supply box, but not so small that it is easily lost or misplaced.With the now standard laser printed labels, you have to keep to keep an entire box or risk crumpling a page. This pad of 40 shipping labels is a generous enough supply for home and small business use. I like that they are in a pad that keeps them all together and even come in a resealable bag. They come in a pad like a pad of PostIt notes so you just tear one off the pad when you want one. I received a single pad of these address labels to review. It is a pad of labels for with From/To on it. MORE of them in the pad and maybe a bit bigger...but maybe I just need to write smaller.GREAT ITEM!PS - I came back and added that I actually bought this item I was so pleased with the sample I got to review. I like to keep a pad of mailing labels around for the occasional present to be mailed or the odd ebay item. This handy little pad of labels makes setting up the printer to print just one label obsolete. You get a little pad of 40 labels, clearly marked with "To" and "From," and plenty of space to write in. Avery's Shipping pad labels fit the bill in both regards. Easy to write on, easy to tear off, simple.I keep a pad near my stamps in my desk drawer. The Avery pad is nice and handy--but buy only if your penmanship is good, as these do not go into a printer. Nice because it is a pad, which makes writing on it easy--you don't need a hard surface underneath it. Nice little pad of labels, good for taking to the Post Office with the address filled out if you are going to put a package together there This is a pad of of 4*3 inch sticky shipping labels There is a "TO" and "from section, which are separated by a thick pale  blue line. The pad supplies a sufficiently firm backing to allow for controlled writing (unlike those "backless" labels that force you to write on the uneven surface of the package itself).5. This simple pad of heavy duty matte-finish mailing labels slips in my bag -- briefcase, wallet-on-a-cord, whatever -- and never gets lost. The pad is very convenient and would be a big plus for someone who occasionally mails packages.

A handy pad for home, office, car.

Other than that, the pad is great.

Best of all, they come in a pad, so that you tear off one at a time, rather than having single labels that tend to scatter far and wide in a drawer if you let them.
