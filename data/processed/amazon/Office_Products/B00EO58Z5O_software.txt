Inferior software to migrate to my Apple office is not acceptable and disrespects my time and effort. Hmm... All I needed to do was to run the "Document Capture Pro" software and click the options that I wanted. Using the included software makes the scanner a powerful partner. The software is rather straightforward and easy to figure outThere are a few more things to note. It can use either the Document Capture Pro software, or Epson Scan. Epson Scan is software that is common to most if not all of Epson's scanners. The software download and installation from Epson was painless.Performance:The first time I used this scanner, I scanned almost 500 retail receipts. The Fujitsu software is set up for two-sided scan, ignoring blank pages, so a single-sided scan still only shows up as one sheet. The Epson software should have been set up that way by default as well.TWAIN CompliantThe one saving grace of this scanner is that it is TWAIN compliant and therefore I can scan directly from PaperPort, bypassing the Document Capture Pro software entirely. However, the software is so user unfriendly it's just not worth the hassle. Installed the software from the CD.2. (I actually did this while the software was installing.)4. It took a little while to figure out the software but even a newbie like me can do it. I have to say that I am as impressed by the software suite packaged with the scanner as I am with the hardware. The included software enables you to scan documents to pdf and convert pdf documents to editable text. The software spied them on the network, presenting me with the option of using the other scanners (to scan to the cloud...). This is a software fix, but it should have been addressed before release. The software most likely to be used is Document capture, which as it sounds is a simple no-nonsense scanning application which scans documents in a variety of formats, such as jpeg, tiff and PDF. The software has a rudimentary workflow manager that can send output from the scanner to the destinations described above, but can also send output to a Webdav or ftp server, and email. The software itself has the ability to rotate and reorder pages, but not much else.I tested the scanner with the Mac's Image Capture application, and the scanner was not available. The software can convert the document to text, a spreadsheet or a HTML file.The scanner handles a variety of scan sizes; plastic ID cards, business cards and standard paper sizes, including legal size documents. Although installing the software for the first time was a slow process (taking over 20 minutes -- why?? On the Mac, the software literally looks like something from 1998. After installing the software, the Epson Software Update application automatically opened to check for updates. Please re-install the software." With the WorkForce, the software titles (Epson Scan and Document Capture Pro) are clunky, slow, feel hopelessly out-of-date, and it's difficult to find where the PDF option is (not in Epson Scan), let alone the slow-as-molasses OCR. Should there be third-party software available that could benefit from the rugged hardware (I don't have Acrobat Pro, so I can't speak to this), then this might be a great deal. The Epson software overall lags and needs improvement. The software is different than the Fujitsu, but with a little learning, it is easy to work with. The software is typical of Epson devices. Close Document Capture.The software and its installation was typical of every Epson product I've owned over the past 20 years - less than ideal. The software issues, lack of an included carrier sheet and selling price would normally be enough for me to drop a star - but the speed and quality of the scanner so exceeded my expectations, that I'm giving it a 5. It comes with software that 'reads' the documents as they are scanned, and produces PDF files that can be searched for specific words. The software is not as good as my snapscan (fujitsu). If you have software that requires twain compatibility, this is a good option.You may look at the price between this and a ix500 and think that this is definitely cheaper, but remember that the snapscan version that this directly competes with comes with a full copy of adobe acrobat standard. This contrasts poorly with Fujitsu, where the software has been polished for years and basically nobody has any problems with it. The software was very reliable and the TWAIN driver allowed me to interface with all my TWAIN compliant software. The software was easy to install, and I am very pleased that a TWAIN driver is included in the main install so that you can scan to your software of choice, e.g. The software has even more advanced features, which would be extremely useful if they weren't let down by poor quality OCR. The software looks for the relevant text within a rectangular area you define, but unless there is large empty border around this text, you will inevitably either cut off some of the text, or include some of an adjacent line, due to slight differences in position and paper feed from page to page. The software is straight forward and I was able to select the exact folder where and in what format I wanted to save my documents.There are a ton of different options for saving your scanned files. When saving as a PDF, you can make it searchable since the Epson software includes the OCR ability. The software is ok, not awesome, but overall this is a very solid entry into what is now a crowded market for this style of scanner. No software crashes but still took a while. The software was easy to use. I just wish the software installation was faster.If you found this review helpful please give it a thumbs up below. As of now there is no mobile software for iOS and Android devices, you cannot use it from the network computer, it does not have Wi-Fi, it does not work as a stand alone scanner that can be used without computer and comes with very limited PDF editing software.The Epson DS-510 scanner is very versatile otherwise, and can handle a variety of document, cards etc. But scanning from the software on the computer desktop, Epson DS-510 is sluggish. Installing the software is the first thing you have to do. Setup was easy, and the included software wasn't as bloated as I was expecting given my history with Epson scanners. The Brother software required a little more hand-holding, but was still fairly simple for someone with some computer experience. I loaded the full software suites even though I didn't need some of the software (like OCR) for photos.I started testing with the Brother, and noticed that the feed tray seemed to hold the photos weirdly. Probably not because the software image editing controls are limited to brightness and contrast, and 1200dpi isn't enough for big enlargements.But for us amateurs who need to get a ton of photos digitized with decent quality, the Epson DS-510 works great for me at a reasonable price. I won't rehash all the other software reviews here, suffice to say the software is bad. The software issues are enough for me to go back to Fujitsu and buy the iX500. )Cloud Connectivity - The DS-510 Document Capture Pro software has several options for storing scanned documents. Unfortunately, the Document Capture Pro software only works with the DS-510.A
