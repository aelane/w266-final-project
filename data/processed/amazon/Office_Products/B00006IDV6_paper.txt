I love graph paper and it always comes in handy for so many things. This is the standard three hole paper to be put into binders. I just love using graph paper for notes and drawings. This paper has reinforced holes so the paper is extra sturdy. I really like this paper, as it is excellent for math and other graphing. This graph paper with reinforced edges is a great idea. The paper feels to be a good thickness and the look is good. The paper itself is thicker and of a better quality than the regular binder paper that I normally use. This paper is perfect for our needs.Highly Recommended!CFH This graph paper is double sided and has different size graph lines on the front and back. This is very good paper and we like it a lot. Otherwise, they're borderline copy paper thickness (but just a hair thicker). I generally buy heavier weight paper for my own needs, such as taking notes in class and the like, because I like for the paper to take the ink from the fountain pens that I use for writing, without bleeding all over the pages behind it, or feathering all over the page.What I do love for heavier paper isHammermill Laser Print Paper - 8 1/2'' x 11'' Letter Size - White - 24# - 98 Brightness - 500 sheet Reamlb. It's a WHOLE LOT cheaper than the Rhodia paper, and you can put it into your own binder if you want. The paper is not glaringly white but has an almost dove grey tint which is very soft and easy to read from. The paper has a nice substantial and quality heft. The paper would be improved by not including the FIVE STAR four times with 5 star shapes underneath by the holes. You can but the paper isn't that thick or resistant to a slight bleed. I appreciate the paper quality and the reinforced edge... This paper avoids the entire need for those little guys. Graph paper is an essential in the desk of any scientist or engineer. The paper is nice to write on with most instruments, but will bleed slightly with pens that release a lot of ink (fountain pens). This is graph paper with reinforced edges, for snapping into a ring binder. The paper is heavier than table quadrille ruled.It's funny, but I worked at a place where we'd do all our notes on quadrille ruled paper, a holdover from engineering and chemistry classes, as well as lab notebooks. I pass on ruled paper unless it's a narrow or college ruled option, and I always select a graph ruled paper. I'm very impressed by this paper not only because of the clear, yet faint lines, but because it's a 20 lb weight and offers two sizes of the quads. I never really thought much of reinforced paper - I mean, it's paper, how much more durable can it be? The paper is much thicker than the cheaper graph paper and they uphold very well through erasing, writing with pencil, and everyday school wear and tear. Overall, the paper is very good, the lines are clear and crisp, and it holds up very well. It's notebook paper, what else can I say...my daughter needed it for school and amazon had it. The paper stays IN the three ring binders. Compared to other filler paper and notebooks, this paper is more dense, the lines are more consistent, and the transparent tape will help the pages stay in their place (I hope, they did so far).Taking one star off for having Five Star printed on the transparent tape - it's distracting and not needed. I do try to wait for this paper to go on sale but even when it's not it's worth it.I was so frustrated with my son's school binder which looked like it had exploded by the time he got home every day. Graph paper is a requirement for some math and science classes, and it can make note taking and organizing easier. This graph paper is especially nice because it is a little stronger and the holes are reinforced. This paper, which is both thick and reinforced, is ideal for the job. When we've been fortunate enough to find graph paper, it&#8217;s never been as high quality as Mead&#8217;s Five Star Graph Ruled Reinforced Filler Paper. The paper quality itself seems ideal, not to thin, not to thick. When examining this paper, I initially thought my mind was playing tricks on me, but no, the squares on the front really are bigger than the squares on the back and intentionally so, which gives the paper more versatility than its generic counterpart. Well, I do and I love this quadrille paper. The paper is strong, they don't rip easily. Graph paper is something I've been using since my elementary school days: useful for geometry and interesting because, well, GRID. Since this is heavier paper with a reinforced edge, I'm confident it will hold up for the duration of my project. Since the paper doesn't bleed, I can use a variety of inks and markers. The paper also has sufficient density so that I can write with liquid ink on it. First, this is heavier paper that will stand up under use. So I use graphing paper to neatly lay out my letters, numbers, and punctuation marks. What I like best about this graph paper is that every page is reinforced along the binder hole area, so helpful for when you're turning pages quickly--good to know that they won't rip on every turn. I tested this paper for those three issues and was surprised that it didn't suffer from any of them. As filler paper goes, it's on the stronger side and was surprisingly opaque from front to back (at least with the use of regular and colored pencils and a ballpoint pen- I can't speak for very wet ink use).The selling point of this is that it has a plastic strip on the side to reinforce the points at which it has been punched for binders and mine seemed solid in this regard. I checked my paper for this as well and all of the sheets seemed identical and the squares were perfectly aligned. This paper is very helpful in showing my seven year old how to read and make graphs showing all the various data points she likes to collect. I like graph paper, and the reinforced end is useful. The paper is a standard 8.5" x 11", unlike some other notebook papers on the market.However, the paper is of an inferior quality. Second, the paper is not high quality enough to prevent bleeding to the back when marker is used -- I think a higher pound paper would be much better.Overall, the paper is good but not great. I love this paper. I will also tell you that you can print graph paper from the internet if you need a lot for practice, and just use this better stuff for homework or labs. But I usually buy this graph paper for my own use. I thought this was nice graph paper and here's why:*It is nice and moderately thick at a 20 lb. I am not sure how to review lined paper... It's paper.

This is heavy weight paper with squares.

But this holds up well, and is worth more than basic quadrille paper.

This paper is great because of the reinforced hole- it won't tear and migrate out of your binder/notebook.
