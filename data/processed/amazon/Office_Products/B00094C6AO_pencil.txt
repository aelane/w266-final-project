This is an excellent pencil sharpener. Not only that, compared to other pencil sharpeners I have from Staples for example, it is extremely quiet. It tries to rotate the pencil in a rather odd manner as it sharpens but it works so who cares about that.A very good pencil sharpener.AD2 This corded Stanley Bostitch pencil sharpener comes with a hefty weight. It sharpens a dull pencil to pin-point under a second and a brand new pencil in about 4 seconds. That is twice as fast as my battery-powered pencil sharpener. NO ONE has created a pencil sharpner that can last a year in a classroom. When I was looking for a new pencil sharpener to replace my old Xacto model, there were a few features I wanted. I've used electronic pencil sharpeners where it only shaved one side of the lead/pencil. Where you had to twist and rotate the pencil to get it to be fully sharpened. It's rudimentary where you stick the pencil in and wait until you feel you can't push it in further, and everytime you have a fully sharp pencil. With this pencil sharpener, I found myself emptying it out once a week.Lastly, was appearance. This pencil sharpener lastsd 6 months in my middle school classroom, the last 3 months were tough, though.At first, this sharpener was a big hit. I would say this is about as nice a pencil sharpener as i have used. And it's quiet, for a pencil sharpener. However, every pencil that goes in this machine comes out with one side of the point still covered with wood and the other side very deeply exposing the lead. I have another pencil sharpener that never does this, and I tried the same pencils on both my regular sharpener and this one, so I know it's the machine and not the pencil. We just got this pencil sharpener but so far I'm very satisfied with it. This is a great pencil sharpener for children at school. Of all my pencil sharpeners, this Bostich pencil sharpener is my current favorite for many reasons:1)  It sharpens quickly and quietly (for an electric pencil sharpener). If I put the pencil back in and tilt it a tiny bit, that does take care of the problem.2) When I take the shaving tray out, there are some shavings that didn't make it into the tray laying inside the sharpener. It has a LED that lights when the pencil is sharp, but the sharpener does not stop grinding. This makes it awkward, and harder to keep the pencil perfectly vertical. If the pencil is not perfectly vertical, it gets ground off center. When we insert a pencil, the grinding blade sounds like it chops a chunk out of the pencil when starting.This will handle 6 pencil sizes, 3 larger and 2 smaller than standard, the insertion disk has detents and is rotated to position the desired hole size over the sharpening cavity. Why is a good pencil sharpener SO hard to find? I was wary about getting this pencil sharpener because of all the previous bad reviews but I was pleasantly surprised because it works great for me. I must say I was a little disappointed in this Stanley Bostitch pencil sharpener. We have found we have to manually rotate the pencil while it is in the sharpener to get an even sharpening. The pencil did come out nice and sharp and the mechanical action during sharpening was smooth. I didn't have to rotate the pencil as I usually do with most sharpeners in order to get an even point.

but you can't because you have to push so hard that the pencil will slip out of your fingers.. what a pain.

Like many pencil sharpeners, you are going to have to keep one hand on the sharpener while you feed your pencil into it otherwise, the sharpener gets pushed back.

(a pencil sharpener that sharpens pencils... wonderful... a pencil sharpener that teaches personal responsibility?
