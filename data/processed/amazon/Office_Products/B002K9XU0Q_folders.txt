Because I tend to reuse manila folders multiple times, this really appealed to me as long as it really worked. It lets me reuse the folders over and over again without having to deal with crossed out labels or ones that don't peel off easily. They might not be so useful for folders that are permanent, where you don't want the labels to peel off.I tried removing and reusing the labels and they can be reused four or five times - after that I'd replace them with new labels.They could be used for labeling workshop draws and bins. I try to reuse folders and files whenever possible. They say they'll "stick securely, remove cleanly" so you can reuse file folders. We know how some folders won't need changing and how some will. I often re-use file folders and these are perfect for use from making the first label until the last. We cannot reuse folders if the labels are not cleanly removed. This especially concerned me as my folders for college definitely do get a beating. Recommended for those who use file folders for different things, for short period of time! Printing them out makes it more easy to locate the needed folders. They stuck to the folders without any issues or peeling. But some of the folders have become very dog-eared on the tab of the folder, and the label can't be transferred to a new folder. I often use folders for a few weeks and then throw them away once the project is completed. I got these mostly to help with re-labeling my folders and this works great for that. However, if you've already written on your folders with black markers then you quickly find the flaw in this product. So in general I would recommend buying some new folders to go with this labels and start everything off fresh. Made my 2010 folders for the year with these and they're easy to use and fit nicely atop legal size folders.Am a big fan of all POST IT products--get this one to keep yourself on track for the next year! I have hanging folders and don't use just plain file folders. After having torn many folders try to un-stick previous labels, these are a great find!
