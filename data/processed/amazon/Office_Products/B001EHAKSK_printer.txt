I ordered this printer and got it set up and operational with no trouble. I have another HP printer which is much older and I periodically see lines developing on color pictures and know to clean the print heads; that usually clears up the problem.No lines had appeared on the color pictures so I had not cleaned the print heads, my mistake! I really like this printer. This printer produces outstanding photo prints. I bought this printer because it was only $100. It can also print up to 8x10.This printer has 5 ink cartridges: cyan, magenta, yellow, black, and photo black. I'm pretty sure it costs more to print from this printer than to take your images to other stores.I really like this printer but it is a convenience product, not a money saver. I needed a printer when I got a new Windows 7 64-bit computer. The printer has memory-card slots and an LCD screen, and it prints on printable CDs. I have been using this printer at my office every day since 2006. I will run this printer until it dies.
