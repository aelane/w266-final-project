My laptop hasn't left my Lapdesk since I got it. It is self-powered so all AI have to do id place the laptop on the Lapdesk and then plug in the USB and its ready to go.Compared to other lapdesks, some of the things I liked about this one is that the underside is formed to have a curve that makes it easy to situate the lapdesk with a laptop on it firmly and securely whether you sit with you feet on the ground or cross-legged. I love using my laptop in comfortable chairs and one of my favorite spots is out on the balcony when the weather is nice. I bought a new 17.3" laptop so I needed to retire my old, smaller Logitech laptop cooling desk (which worked wonderfully for the 1+ years I used it). A laptop this size will partially cover the speakers but it doesn't seem to affect the sound quality.Speaking of the sound quality, it's not jaw-dropping but they're a BIG step-up from the laptop's built-in speakers. Those with a smaller laptop or a netbook should definitely consider theLogitech N550 Speaker Lapdesk. A 17" laptop would rest on and muffle the speakers. Since then, every laptop in the house sits on a little fan.My 13-inch laptop doesn't have very good speakers either in terms of quality of sound or volume. I use my laptop in bed, on the couch, while watching TV, or in the kitchen if I'm eating alone. It's perfect for a 15 to 17 inch laptop, and still quite useful with smaller computers. My Acer laptop just doesn't put out much volume. When you plug it into your laptop, you lose a USB socket on your laptop. It also doesn't seem to be fully compatible with my Acer laptop running Vista.

I'll post how to do this using Windows 7, which is the OS on my laptop, at the end of my review.

Currently, I push my laptop over to one side & make do with the room I have; it's not ideal but it does work.~~The lapdesk is on the heavy side; my daughter is always carrying the lapdesk and her laptop to other areas which is awkward & looks a bit comical because the lapdesk's weight, 5 lbs., & size approx 20.5" x 12" x 3".~~I use theBelkin USB 2.0 4-Port Ultra Mini Hub F5U407with the lapdesk to provide more USB ports.~It's simple to use; just plug & play.~We all like the sound.~The fan is whisper quiet!~It's very comfortable to use on your lap & works nicely on a desk too.All in all this is a great lapdesk, but could use a few more features to make it absolutely the best lapdesk ever....................*Using Windows 7, how to use headphones and your lapdesk fan at the same time.right click on the sound icon in your taskbar; choose 'playback devices'**choose Logitech Speaker Lapdesk N700 (it should already be highlighted if you're currently using them)~choose properties; click on "Use this device (enable)", choose "Don't use this device (disable)" click apply~When you're finished using your headphones & want to go back to the Logitech N700 speakers, choose "Use this device (enable)" click applyorClick 'Start'click 'Control Panel'click 'hardware and sound'click 'sound'click 'manage sound devices'follow above instructions beginning with **

I was always putting my laptop on the floor, bed, couch and it usually got overheated after a while.
