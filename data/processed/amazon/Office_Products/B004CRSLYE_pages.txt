500 pages at a time disappear with ease! If you have perfect pages placed carefully in the thing it will eat them sloooooowly. Usually you can tell as soon as you put 8 to 10 pages through to me most shredders should be able to handle an envelope that hasn't been opened (because let's face it we all become junk mail that we definitely do not need open). It's powerful enough to handle a few pages at once.The cross-cut functionality is essential in ensuring data security today, and this device makes reasonable small pieces. Since most of these are not nice 8x11 pages, then the auto feeder is pretty useless. It does effortlessly shred 80 pages of paper. You can stack up to 60 pages for shredding and the unit feeds the paper into the shredder. Got 10 pages? Got 1000 pages? Got, say, more than 10 but less than 100 pages? Stapled pages tend to make it bunch up and stop working. The Swingline Stack and Shred allows you to "set it and forget it" when it comes to shedding multiple pages. It claims to shred 60 pages at a time on automatic operation. If you input stapled pages, it will get stuck and stop working.
