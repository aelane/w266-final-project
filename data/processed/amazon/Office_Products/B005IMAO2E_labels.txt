Avery Print to the Edge Oval Labels: These labels are the perfect size for a gift bag or present. I used these labels for visitor gift bags at church. I recommend these labels to any small business or charity. I've always wanted to make my own labels but didn't want to pay a company for 500 when I only needed 20 labels. These Avery labels are working perfectly for my needs!I used the suggested Avery template (#22804), which opens using Microsoft Word. )I was very happy to see shaped labels!!! :) I know I can print completely blue (or green or whatever) labels, but that is a lot of ink...they could make a few colors to make it easier for us! The labels do print in full color and to the edge as promised. The labels are a nice size - 1  x 2  and you can also print to the edge - which makes a very nice presentation. I needed some special shaped labels for my product logo, without the expense of having to go to a big printer. After receiving these labels, I went online and used Avery's 'Design & Print online' to create something new. I wanted these labels for jars of jams and other home-made preserved foods. Never having printed labels on my PC I was curious to see how difficult it would be to do it. These labels can be printed with a laser printer (feeds flawlessly in my Okidata C3200 Color Laser Printer) or inkjet printer (but didn't try).The package contains ten sheets, each with eighteen 1" x 2.5" oval labels that have to be printed all at the same time (according to the instructions), for a total of 180 labels. You will have over 100 different, gorgeous, pre-designed labels which you can customize with your own text! I wish that there were more than 180 labels at this price, but I believe you will be pleased with the product. These labels are great. The labels look great just don't plan to use the avery template. You can resize your own logo/graphic to fit the labels by using a net-based photo resize program.To create different text effects, such as concave or rainbow, Insert>Word Art. These labels really catch the eye. The labels are glossy and attractive, anything but homemade-looking, and they stick well to the machines without leaving residue or being too easy to pull off by a bored employee on break.I'm about to design more, highlighting individual beverages, like our yummy hot chocolate and cappuccinos. These are GREAT oval labels; they are of excellent quality and are NOT paper-thin like most consumer grade labels. These oval labels are really nice, and look a good deal better than the usual rectangular labels. )I plan to use these to make professional looking labels for the pies I give as Thanksgiving treats and the jewelry that give at Christmas. Well, they're labels, and they don't walk on water, heal the sick, or make water into wine. I have used these labels for a variety of projects, from garage sale labeling, to Christmas packages. The labels are not as large as they appear on the cover, so use them efficiently. When I got these, I thought I was just getting labels, but instead I was getting a comprehensive set of software and web interface to help me make really great labels, at a relatively inexpensive price.Now I see that they have provided quite a lot of additional user support for users of their label products. These new labels are well marked with the Avery web site on the backing sheet, and on their site, you can do label layout online (they also have free downloadable software, DesignPro, but that software doesn't know about these particular labels). And the labels looked great once printed, with a nice degree of glossiness.I am really impressed about how many resources that Avery is providing to buyers of their labels. With my older Avery labels, sometimes I would need just a few labels, so would print off just a few from the bottom, and later feed the sheet in again when I needed a few more labels. These labels are very easy to work with. The labels were easy to remove from the paper backing and mounted on the jars easily. I used these to create labels for some hand-made items as gifts. These oval labels are gorgeous.These are thick, super glossy labels. Once dry the labels don't bleed ink.The Avery Wizard add in for Word is really only one way to use these labels. I love Avery labels and the unlimited uses I can find for them. These labels are super glossy and designed to be easy to peel off the sheet. I love that the labels adhesive is very secure, yet is easy to remove and clean up. These are nice big labels that make it easy to read even from a distance. These OVAL labels come 18 to a sheet (3 wide by 6 labels tall) and 10 sheets per package for a total of 180. If you are considering ordering these labels you can use the Avery website to experiment with creating your label and print it on standard paper to get an idea how they will appear before purchasing this product. These labels are designed to work with both laser and inkjet. The labels look professional. These labels are very nice and work very well for my wife's candle business. She uses various labels for different products and these work perfectly for small candles or wax melts. These labels work wonderfully to make a nice, elegant tape for the cards, ribbon, or anything else that you might want. These labels will certainly add a professional touch to anything.
