Since the 5160 template is compatible with the 3100-A's, it makes sense to change to the 3M brand. The template does NOT guarantee that alignment will be perfect. You can also download 3M's own template via their website. I used the Avery template, and the labels prined out slightly off center. They work great and the MS Word template was super easy to find on the 3M site! We used an Avery template what worked fine, but 3M does have templates available online should you want to try them.These are only address labels, but when you need them you want them to work, which these do, and not cost a samll fortune. 3M provides a template (3100-A) at its website that can be used in MS Word. Downloading the template was quick and troublefree. 3M's Word template for the 3100-A can be used should you need to put different addresses on each label.Though the labels are recommended for laser printers, it went through my HP AIO inkjet printer just fine without jamming or the labels peeling. 3M Address Labels are compatible with Avery 5160 template. You need to be sure to use the Avery 5160 template. Go to 3M and get a free template and in a very few minutes you'll be printing your personal custom labels.The quality of the labels themselves is the BEST,they stay stuck like they're supposed to stay and they don't get non-sticky around the edges over time before use,like some brands do....and it is sooo much fun creating your own labels successfully & it's easy! This template printed spot on and I was ready to zip through my address list. OpenOffice has a built-in template for these which is really handy as regular mail merge/custom fields doesn't work for address labels. Use Avery template. Download template. They were very easy-to-use, stuck well, the Avery template worked perfectly, and they stuck to the appropriate packaging as address/shipping labels well!I would definitely recommend these, especially if you are looking for a substitute for the Avery ones, without giving on the quality side: these are a nice thickness, without being too bulky, and are still easy to peel & adhere: loved them! I was able to download the template without any hassles and figured out how to use them with ease. The downloaded template was lined up perfectly with the printer. They are compatible with the Avery 5160 template, so that they can be used in conjunction with most Microsoft Office products, and can be used with either a inkjet or laser printers.I've been very pleased with how the labels perform. I use my standard template (Avery 5160) that I had set-up through Microsoft and it went through without a hitch. They are compatible with the Avery template so producing your own labels is very easy to do.
