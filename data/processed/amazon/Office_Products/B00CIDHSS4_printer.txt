This printer DOES NOT smear like regular inkjets. I received this printer today, hooked it up, set it up on my wireless network and then the computer would not connect. First off, these printer is huge! Overall, I like the printer but don't love it simply because it doesn't do everything I need it to do, or at least not easily enough to figure out with a little fiddling. This is a big printer, Big box its shipped in, needs some good desk space in my office. This Officejet printer, so far, seems really fabulous.What I love:It's huge, and the whole top lifts up to scan something massive like a map.The copying feature is smooth and fast just like a mega-bucks professional office copier.Print quality seems brilliant. This is my first printer and it is amazing! But it is still quieter than the Brother printer. I use it as printer, scanner and copier, not for fax.My only concern is to scan remotely, I need to install an HP software on my computer and let it running in the system tray. I have a Canon printer that enables me to scan remotely without installing any software. Great printer. The printer sees the computer. A new HP OJ 7610 printer is being sent to our home and we will send the old one at no cost to ourselves. We were told the new printer will be here on 1 November. used) printer to replace our brand new out of the box one and now we were charged anything after were told we would be charged nothing?

It should be noted that this fine hard -working  printer does NOT have duplexing ability (printing on both sides of the paper).

The printer will tell you how many papers your current ink supply will accommodate.The color buttons on the printer cover all desirable functions, the work flows, simply navigate.
