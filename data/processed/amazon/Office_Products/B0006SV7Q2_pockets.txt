Having 4 pockets instead of 2 is also a nice add-on, along with the plastic covering that allows you to easily change the cover and edge with the actual contents. There are two plastic pockets each on the back and front of the inside of the case, for inserting a few loose documents. I especially like the extra interior pockets as well as the ability to insert a cover sheet in the clear sleeve on the front. "There are two slip pockets front and back for loose sheets of paper, and that's handy as well.All in all this is a great binder (not that binders make anyone's world go around, but you really do know when you are trying to work with a low-quality binder, which this one is not.5 stars. Inside are four pockets into which you can slip files or extra papers.A good quality binder. *There are four inner pockets, 2 in each inner side of the front and back covers.The outside contains side, front, and back clear plastic windows for labeling the outside of the binder.I suppose I would say that this is the state of the art binder but that acolade is going a bit too far. There are two flat interior pockets along both the front and back walls of the binder for holding additional materials. There are two pockets inside the front cover and also the back cover - one lower than the other, so they are multi use. First, the four pockets inside the front and back covers are rather thin. Their are two pockets of different heights on each side. I do question whether those pockets can really stand up to much use since the plastic seems thing and easily stretched. It has 4 instead of 2 pockets on the inside covers. The multiple pockets inside both the front and back covers is quite handy. The inner pockets are well designed and files rarely slip out. It has four pockets inside for papers that don't need to be punched as well as a clear view for putting your own cover sheet in. I like The clear pockets on the outside cover & side that I can use to insert labeling information. Finally, it's also nice to have two inside pockets on the front & two on the back. It has two pockets on the insides of both the front cover and back cover.
