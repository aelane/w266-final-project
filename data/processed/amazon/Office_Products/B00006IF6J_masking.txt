3M sells less expensive masking tape, too. This is a great masking tape. This masking tape unrolls easily and tears easily with just your fingers. It feels thicker than the regular masking tape I am used to using. This is some of the best masking tape I&#8217;ve ever used. This masking tape is oversized and is 1.5 inches wide by 60 yards (2160 inches) long. It is a premium masking tape that works perfect for automotive work or even masking trim when painting your house. This is the first masking tape I have used that didn't come off hard when you went to remove it. This is some high-quality masking tape. WRONG!The 3M High Performance Masking Tape is the BEST masking tape I have ever used. This masking tape is pretty good, working not just for painting but also for taping patterns to fabric instead of pinning them and also working well to bind a big box of previously loose and tangled computer cords into tidy bunches that are easily labeled. This will work excellently for any of my masking needs, though its extra cost will only be of benefit for baking applications, such as is done in automotive paint shops and the like; it is rated to withstand temperatures of up to two hundred and fifty degrees Fahrenheit. If you are looking for a dependable masking tape, this is it. A great masking tape! This is very good masking tape, but $13/roll is way too much money. The blue masking tape that most professional painters use costs half as much at my local hardware store. Will buy again when I next need masking tape. This is the best masking tape I've ever used and recommend it. This masking tape is perfect for making a nice, straight edge during painting. This is an excellent masking tape for painting. You can buy cheaper masking tape but cheaper doesn't perform to the standards this one does.
