Worked for poster boards pictures and paper even pictures. I used this to hang a large poster given to me as a gift, and these squares don't show through the white paper.Anyone who was ever a teacher knows the putty can make a mess, isn't always very sticky, and can leave blue marks on the wall. I never needed to do that.If you put up a poster and use six tabs, you have enough for three posters, and for the price that's a good deal. The lighter the poster, the more success I had with it staying up on my porous walls. The poster I tried to hang on the walls of my house went on easily, stuck easily, and came off in the same fashion. Mind you, it was a light, thin poster, not a thick heavy one. This didn't work too well on a poster I tried hanging up, but when it comes to putting up paper it worked fairly well. You have to be very careful to peel your poster off slowly or the stickie will rip the poster or will be left on the wall or the poster, where it'll stick to anything in sight.These stickies would be great for decorating a kid's room or a classroom at the beginning of a semester, where things are going to be up for at least a few months--for daily putting up/taking down they're not as good. I tried to use these to hang a large poster. The poster I tried is laminated and my wall is slightly bumpy, so this may be the reason why the tabs release so easily. The poster I hung aggressively stuck to the wall, making the tabs difficult to remove. However, I hung a lightweight poster to my wall and the tabs worked perfectly. Granted I haven't tried to remove the poster or tabs, so perhaps that's where the problems will lie.The package is reclosable, which is a nice touch. You can easily mount a poster on the wall and later take the poster down without leaving a sticky residue.I like the feel of the tabs - they feel sturdy. For a poster however, more than one tab will be required.

I needed to hang a poster on an existing framed picture.

It ripped the poster and left goop on the glass.

And unlike poster putty, it doesn't leave a mark (poster putty can leave a greasy mark both on your wall and on the paper...and tape can leave residue) you can use them for more than just sticking paper to a wall--say if you have something like a loose light switch cover, you can stack these inside to bridge a gap.
