I love organizing things, and I love labeling things! Here are some things I like about it. Assuming you are more of a neat-freak to begin with and that is why you are organizing and labeling things in the first place, this doesn't "cut it".Next, there is no way to measure out equal strips. This is also true of other things that need labeling. I'm able to use it for so many things. I was surprised how well they stay on things (much better than regular post it notes, probably because of the surface area). I really like Post-it Full Adhesive Roll; I am bad about not labeling things, and these are just too easy not to use. You could even use it for decorating things temporarily or as a stencil line for a dryer kind of paint. It works pretty well but there were a few things that weren't up to par. It sticks well to most things. I have found myself labeling other things that are stored on high shelves (like binders with my backup cd's, boxes with outgrown baby clothes, boxes with sewing or craft patterns--saves me climbing up and getting the wrong box).
