Really wonderful and beautiful gold labels for ink jet printers. These beautiful gold foil labels are so perfect for addressing cards and gifts, very festive and to me add elegance to any correspondence.Perfect for the holiday season, they are nothing but stunning and lend a seasonal charm.They are easy to use with your Inkjet printer and a reasonable price for this level of quality.I love them and they just seem to say "holidays. In the past, I sometimes ordered printed gold labels to use to put in the inside cover of books and to place to personal items to identify them. I liked the gold labels since they presented a more "quality" appearance. The gold tone is perfect and isn't over-shiny and cheap looking. The gold foil look is perfect for applications where you want something snazzier than a standard white paper label; for example I expect these will be used as return address labels for my family's Christmas cards this year. I picked the gold color to use with our holiday cards for this year, and they look classy and elegant.That being said, it was a pain to deal with the template! I also love their eye-catching gold color.There are, however, a few rules one needs to keep in mind when using these:1 - The instructions on each page say "Use best print quality settings"  This is imperative! A gold label that doesn't smear the minute you remove it from the printer. the gold foil will definitely lend your mailings with a touch of elegance. The gold was nice for Christmas cards but I don't think it was worth the extra time and hassle.
