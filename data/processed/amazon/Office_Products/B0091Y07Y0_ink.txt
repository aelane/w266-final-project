The ink is wicked expensive. And, this is considering that it has 5 ink wells. It prints well, doesn't use too much ink, and makes the set up for wireless printing very easy. The ink usage is too high, it does not print high quality copies very well, and it won't accept 80 pound paper. Now I want to say that the ink for this is on kind of the high side. It seemed I was constantly getting new ink and they were not remotely cheap.This printer has already surpassed my old printers ink use mark and it's still quite happy. There is a specific ink for printing photos. the Cyan ink not being output). We will see how long the smaller ink cartridges last -- which could be a major issue since they cost 50 bucks for a set... if you have to replace them every month or 2, you could be running in to big bucks -- in which case a "Workforce" printer may be a better investment.I guess it all boils down to what you want in your printer.-- if you are more concerned about low-output but high quality and ease of use, then the Expression series is a great choice.-- if you are interested in more typical office use and lower cost-to-own, then you should go for one of the Workforce printers -- despite the large footprint. Well, it did-- except that the black ink cartridge was streaking. Individual ink cartridges for each color so you only replace the ones that are empty (less wasteful).4. I was afraid that the ink supply after printing 3 photos, one which was very dark, would show noticeable attrition, but they are holding up well so far. The ink cart/pack last a long time even on the highest setting. The ink pack can be found easily at any big box store for about $40. Putting it together was easy along with the 5 ink cartridges. I found that after I unpacked it and added the ink cartridges, etc it was easy to just go ahead and add it to the WiFi from the printer menu. Having so many ink cartridges will save me money because on other printers I always run out on one color more than others. Individual ink cartridges (replace only the color you need replaced)7. It's ink. And it's not fancy ink. I am very familiar with both regular 4 ink inkjet printers and the more expensive 6 ink inkjet photo printers as I print a lot of photos for family history as well as for a collectibles magazine and have used both types of printers. The ink cartridges, the scanner, the wireless aspects, it's all really awesome. It comes with three differently color ink cartridges and two blacks (one is for photos), so in theory you only have to replace the color that runs out, rather than an entire multi-color cartridge for where, say, only the magenta had run out.
