Yes, this mouse cuts one or two just fine! The mouse will simply be too large to cut the item out without cutting into the text or picture that you want to cut out.Not very useful. The mouse jammed the second I turned it slightly. He had to take apart the entire mouse to fix the paper jam! The mouse itself seems pretty sturdy and durable. Also, just to be safe, I ran the mouse over a couple surfaces with more force than normal to see if I could see any damage to the surface. The Westcott Scissor mouse is an elegant product, simple to use. The mouse comes in one of those irritating blister packages and I ended up damaging it while unpacking, rendering the mouse unusable.The design could be tremendously improved by making the guide removable and bundling replacements, as well as adding a storage compartment for these replacements inside the mouse. Just hold it like a regular mouse and it cuts paper easily. The mouse fits comfortably into the hand, and just like a computer mouse, is controlled with the index finger. I used the "mouse" to cut out coupons, got frustrated and just used regular scissors. We all know how to use a mouse. Otherwise you're on your own, and the mouse will wander a little to the left or right. And that's what this is - a mechanical  "mouse" with four wheels and a center cutting wheel (which turns when the front wheels turn). This is a "mouse" only in the sense that it vaguely looks like one, and therefore someone in marketing thought it would be trendy. Fortunately, this mouse's price point makes it a great value. I found this "mouse" much harder to use than a plain old scissors and the cutting job from this mouse was pretty messy. The mouse crumpled the paper and never cut.Granted the paper is thin, so I then tried it on typing paper. Even though the mouse is technically capable of following a curve, its shape and handling makes that awkward. I keep absentmindedly trying to use it as a mouse! It is a rolling mouse.
