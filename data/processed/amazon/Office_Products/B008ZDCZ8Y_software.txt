Install the software before attaching and powering up your scanner.Anyway, it took about 5 mins to install all of the programs needed to interface with and run the scanner (I have a iMac desktop computer). The software is included to allow storage to cloud services. However, this software is necessary to set up the one-touch buttons. This is done through the ArcSoft Scan-n-Stitch Deluxe software that comes with this scanner. This software seems to be a discontinued stand-alone product on the Epson website, but it is still sold here on Amazon (through a third party seller) for about $90:Arcsoft Scan-n-Stitch Deluxe. The software also offers tools to brighten up old photos. The software also enables you to connect with other places like Google Docs that makes sharing photos and such easier. I compared it side-by-side with the V370 using the Epson software and also Vuescan by Hamrick Software.Here is the concise comparison, based on the most common scanning tasks:QUICK DOCUMENT SCAN: Both scanners handle this with one button. The software may be better on a PC but I did not test it there. Set up is easy: Just install the software and plug it in. The software doesn't work correctly. Dedicated scanning software - of which  a few brands remain - offer substantially more control, but could be overkill with the V370. It also uses the same software and scanning concepts as the V700, so if you are used to the Epson way you can just carry on.It does have some things I didn't like:* The cover opens "sideways". The software's settings panels based on a usage choice of "Auto", "Home", "Office" or "Professional" are pretty awkward - with some settings appearing in only one of each, where you might expect 'Professional' to include ALL settings. The software on the mac felt... old... not as smooth as the windows version. It comes with two software CDs, one for Microsoft and one for Mac.I chose some old photos to copy to see how they'd come out and frankly, considering these photos are over 40 years old, crinkled and dry, they came out great. They want the software installed BEFORE you hook up to your computer or to electricity. The software is easy to use and fairly self-explanatory and the scanner comes with software for various tasks (e.g., photo software, OCR, etc.). While the basic software is necessary, the others may not be if you either have superior software for that purpose or do not need that particular function. Some of the software will also slip in a screen changing the default file open choices to this software. I would recommend clearing these until you have tried the software and decide you actually want it to be the default on one or more file formats.I installed it on both a Windows 7 and Windows 8 laptop. I had recently upgraded to MacOS X 10.9 (Mavericks) so I was concerned the software might not be compatible. Also the scan-n-stitch software makes it very easy to piece together any large pictures and save them that way. Just install the software and plug it into your computer when prompted, using the INCLUDED USB cable, and you're ready to scan! The Canon software organizes scanning by the destination -- screen image, JPG, PDF. The software for both products has a lot of features, not all of which are intuitive. Unfortunately, the Canon software doesn't permit using unsharp masking and descreening at the same time.User Manual--------------The Canon manual is "classic Japanese" -- it explains all the details (the what), while ignoring the broader view (the why). The Canon scans only negatives.The Epson doesn't support WIA, so you can't scan directly to image-editing software. If the Canon had the software features of the Epson, or the Epson had the physical elegance and WIA functionality of the Canon, it might be possible to declare a "winner".
