These CD size Avery Pocket Tabs obviously hold a single CD and are great for sticking (self adhesive on the back of the pocket tabs) to a presentation folder to allow for the addition of CD media to a report.And, while these Pocket Tabs are also marketed as great for storing receipts, business cards & photos, I am using them for the following:  (1)  Holding my favorite silver earrings (silversmith said to store the silver earrings in plastic to slow down tarnishing) and (2) Inside my desk size checkbook holder to hold deposit slips. After using them I was nervous that the CD would be damaged inside. If you've ever needed to attached a CD or DVD to a report or in a notebook, you'll love this product. and can't see myself really storing CD's in them. These make it very easy to add a CD or DVD to any files you have or presentation binders if you are in an office. This is a 5-pack of flexible colored plastic CD holders. Instead of a CD file with all the CDs or DVDs for a particular class curriculum, I can put the disk in the pocket attached directly to that section of the book. I keep CD's in my glove compartment in between filing them. These are my favorite CD's. Hubby won't let me carry a CD case in my car, as it is too much of a temptation to steal. I found these to be very useful for sticking a CD into a binder by means of the adhesive on the back of the product. Now the CD that I include with a 3-ring binder product wont go wandering off by itself..the CD envelope is adhered to the inside front cover of the binder. Then the CD doesn't get lost or scratched, and is there whenever they need to use the audio CD for a "visual break" while reading(while still having the book there for graphs/pictures). These are the sturdy long-lived CD sleeves, with a handy writable tab and a removable semi-sticky backing to attach them to other items. I have a DVD or CD with full quality images stuck to the inside of the binder. I put six CD's in one, held it upside down and shook it, and it stayed closed. This CD or DVD sized storage goes beyond the regular paper or plastic sleeves in which we traditionally store and transport or disc-sized media.
