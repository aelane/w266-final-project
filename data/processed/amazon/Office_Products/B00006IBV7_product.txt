It worked very well for this product as it has in the past. The final product looks completely professional.That being said,  if you need 500 identical cards,  I would go to a professional printer. Or I may give the product away and let someone else struggle with it. All in all, I like this product for it's clear instructions and ability to save my own design on my hard drive. It's easy to get to, just enter the product number (28878) under the "Create by Product" section.There are a ton of designs to choose from all organized by topic, although I was looking for a design for a bike shop and there really wasn't a lot that trilled me under the sports section. I figured that I would never be able to work this product or if I could, the cards would come out looking like crud. This is a good product that will fit most users' needs, which is why I give it four stars. You can not see the that these were snapped apart - the final product looks great.If you need 500 cards, then making them at home might not be the most costly solution, but for a few dozen specialty cards, these work great. A very good product. I really liked this product for several reasons. overall a great product Overall it's a nice product and you get a decent amount for the price. I received this product via the Vines Program (samples are supplied at no cost for evaluation)as I needed a small number of business cards for a couple of temporary employees. This product did a very nice job, was easy to use, and provided very professional looking cards.The link for the Avery website was easy to use and the templates that they supplied for their cards worked easily with MS Office and an HP OfficJet Printer. I have bought similar product in the past, and they just end up looking a little too non-professional. 5 star product. This is a great product for someone who needs a low volume of cards or likes to switch things up often. This product is easy to use, worked on two different printers with excellent results. Overall, a good product for the price that you pay.
