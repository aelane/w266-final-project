Regular erasers get to the point where they just push the ink around and the wipes leave a smell on your hands that last for days. The erasers are entirely marvelous! I use these erasers to wipe the white board side of my 4-year old son's easel. I was quite impressed at how well these erasers cleaned our whiteboards, even the stuff that had been on there for a while and I was "sure" would never come off! Until now.These erasers completely removed any remnant of the old ink I could not get rid of AND they helped bring a shine back to the whiteboard's finish, which had become dull and grayish. These erasers are the perfect solution to that problem as well as for cleaning up the lower quality white boards.Having used these erasers on a couple of boards so far, I can see that there is definitely going to be a limit to many times they can be used. These magic erasers for whiteboards work better than your typical whiteboard eraser. These erasers do exactly as described. These will replace my erasers and as I'm responsible for purchasing at the office I will now buy only 3M Erasers. The normal erasers work but not as effectively as these. These erasers are better at getting old set-in marks and cloudy areas off of the whiteboard. These are simple erasers that work fairly good on white or even black dry erase boards. These are fantastic erasers, and I carry one with me even though each classroom has a traditional/standard whiteboard eraser. These erasers are a definite improvement over traditional dry board erasers that tend to smear and leave an obnoxious trail of marker dust. They do, however, exceed the old erasers in many ways. These erasers are awesome. I'd recommend these erasers for whiteboards. I ordered these erasers with the hope that I could squeeze a little more life out of them.When they arrived a my house I was dissapointed in that they appeared to simply.be a couple of sponges. Not having used other whiteboard erasers, I cannot say how this compares.I'm not even sure how it compares to a ordinary sturdy sponge. These erasers work great for dry erase markers. These erasers cleaned it off fairly easily by dampening one end of the sponge and using both sides. These erasers are reminiscent of the Mr. Clean Magic Eraser. While I haven't tested these erasers on permanent marker ink, I know that they work great on dry erase boards. The magic erasers without the blue handle thing attached will tend to "compact" more with use so I think this one with the extra blue part should last longer, or that is my impression anyway.As far as cleaning goes - it cleans as well as anything but it isn't perfect. I found these erasers to be very effective at cleaning up my whiteboards at home and at the office. Thus, I would use these erasers sparingly so that they don't wear out, and just use regular whiteboard erasers most of the time. These erasers work like a charm. I always found the old stiff erasers clumsy to use. These 3M erasers offered the potential to take off more of the pen dust and make the board look cleaner--and I can write more and not wait for the cleaned board to dry. Those old erasers only work in ideal situations.This 3M eraser works with very little effort on normal lines and took off a lot of stubborn lines with slightly more effort.I tried wetting the eraser as suggested and it does work getting off really stubborn lines but is messy and leaves the whiteboard damp. These erasers make an annoying squeaking noise, but that's because they actually grip the whiteboard like a squeegee and get all the stuff other erasers leave behind. These erasers are a nice idea. Standard erasers don't always cut it and I don't allow the kids to use the spray themselves. These erasers remind me of the Mr. Clean Erasers, except made for white boards. The two erasers are attractively and securely packaged. )The erasers clean dry erase boards with no need for sprays or cleaners. The erasers with their ergonomic shape are easy to grasp. These whiteboard erasers are great. I hadn't been able to get it clear with  other erasers so had used everything from paper towels to my hand to clean it off with the same effect. Before trying these erasers, I always relied on the little tiny sponges that came with my dry-erase boards (usually attached to the top of the markers). It worked just as well as the erasers that came with the boards, but there was more resistance. These erasers bring 3M technology to the board, last a long time and - it's true! These erasers do essentially the same thing as tissues, but they don't shred, they can be re-used, and they're easy to hold. That being said, the erasers do their job and I am not disappointed in them. I was pleasantly surprised at how well these 3M erasers worked! These erasers, however, did the trick. I've been impressed by magic erasers for use in the home for years, and it occurred to me that these 3M whiteboard erasers might work just as well on vinyl mats. These whiteboard erasers work perfectly so far. Other erasers, cleaning sprays and different products we tried never worked very well, so this is a definite improvement. Since two erasers came in the package I am thinking this may wear down over time but I am not certain. Having used regular magic erasers around the house I shouldn't be surprised, but they still amazed. You get 2 erasers in a pack. I thought they looked more like erasers and were going to be easier for him to use than the felt rag that came with the easel. I am really impressed with how well these erasers work. I finally got around to using my erasers. The erasers themselves aren't very fancy (they seem to be made from some sort of plastic foam in two colors sandwiched together) but they work perfectly.T
