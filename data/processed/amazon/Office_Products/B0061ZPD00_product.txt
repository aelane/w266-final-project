This product is great for school, home and work projects. The product is relatively inexpensive and easy to use, making it a solid choice for the casual user.My middle-school aged daughter has used this product for a school report and got rave reviews from the teacher for her 'professional looking' binding job. I've used this product to bind a cookbook. This product is really nice to have (and cost effective) if you only print a few reports per year. It isn't a bad product but not for me. This product does get the job done but I found it tedious and time consuming to twist the spiral binding through the holes. This product is just the thing. This product has so many possibilities, your own creativity is the limit! I was nervous about this product but I have to say, the instructions were clear and easy to follow and I like the machine. This product is excellent. Yes they intended this product to be for reports, but they provided the paper and rest for making it possible to adapt. I used this product to make a book of family recipes for each of my boys. The product comes with enough materials to make four spiral-bound booklets of ten pages each, with a heavy tagboard back and a clear sheet on the top.In order to make my booklets, I also orderedFellowes Twist and Bind Machine-Free Kit, Pre-Punched Paper Refill, 50 per Pack (5226101)so that I would have enough pages. This is a great product and it does save you a bundle on expensive binding costs. As far as I'm concerned, I think this product is good and it works for small projects. It is a good product. Nice product. This is the product for you. This product would be good for a small or short term project; if you need say one report done and don't have the time or money to do more with it, this is perfect for you.However....it is a tedious process to bind the projects!I tested this kit by printing out a bunch of the recipes I use often, onto the pages and binding them. This is a good product for small jobs and/or presentations. They tend to be a little tight after your first put them together.Overall I found this to be a very good product and personally found it to be quite useful and run actually a little cheaper than some of the major office supply stores locally.
