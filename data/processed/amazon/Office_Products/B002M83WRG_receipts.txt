We found that it was just too small for the receipts we get. "Perfect for receipts or coupons" says the label, and so much more. I got it for 2012 receipts, which tend to be messy and get lost, but this handy storage idea truly has 101 uses. You can easily organize your receipts and other small items that need to be filed and/or scanned. I am ordering another one of these for monthly receipts. I used to store my receipts in one of those large binders, and now I use this and will continue to do so. It's long enough for those longer receipts and coupons I always had to fold to fit. Here's what I use these for: Sorting my receipts for my taxes at the end of every month. If you keep your receipts to be entered into personal finance software or a spreadsheet for tracking actual monthly expenses, this organizer is great. This has already been helpful in organizing receipts for entry into Quicken. We use it for receipts on the go and it works nicely for that.Pros+ Portable+ Sturdy+ Great organization tool, especially for receipts and coupons+ Good value+ Simple to useCons- I think I'd have preferred a snap closure, but this one does enclose it well and probably has a lesser chance of breaking long term. I try to keep receipts for tax records, and to make sure I am charged correctly when the dreaded credit card bill arrives. Naturally they are full of receipts and sometimes it can be tricky to sort through the large file to locate small receipts. I transferred all of my small 2010 receipts to it and it's so much easier to get to them.The organizer expands easily and it's very sturdy. I use this to put and save all my receipts.
