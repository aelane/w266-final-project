I LOVE sheet protectors. So these HEAVY DUTY sheet protectors are a blessing!! These are great sheet protectors--heavy enough to look good and be durable, but not so thick that they make a binder overly bulky (some of the heavyweight protectors are just *too* heavy). The sheet protectors can easily hold about 5 pieces of paper. These sheet protectors are useful and of great quality. It is very easy to slide a 8.5&#34; x 11&#34; sheet into them since they are non-stick. If you try to put a slightly larger sheet, or a few sheets into the same protector, it might not fit. However, putting a single sheet in is easy due to the non-stick feature, and they are sufficient tight that the sheet won't fall out. These are good well made sheet protectors, not flimsy or shoddy like some others I've tried. These sheet protectors are the best you can buy in my opinion. These are really nice, quality top-loading sheet protectors. Where some sheet protectors come apart at the seams sometimes when trying to insert sheets into them, I haven't had this happen with these and I don't expect it to. There isn't much to differentiate top loading sheet protectors. Most sheet protectors I have used has a bit of a static cling holding them closed. But in fairness I've seen sheet protectors that were much flimsier too. These are some quality sheet protectors. Much better than the flimsy sheet protectors sold by Target during the back to school event. These sheet protectors have held up well, even with daily use and frequent page changes. If you need to update the sheet inside, it easily slips out the top for the change. Basically, sheet protector are used for documents that I intend to may keep for years (Mortgage, etc.) I download a LOT of sheet music for reviewing and for sharing with some of my piano students. These sheet protectors are heavy-weight enough to be very durable, but they are also crystal-clear for easy reading and allow for easy page turns while playing. I keep them organized in sheet protectors stored in a binder. They are good, sturdy sheet protectors that, somehow, I can get the paper into without also being easy for the paper to fall out of.Zero frustration. I also use these sheet protectors for scrapbooks too.I like that they come in a box of 100, which is more than enough for whatever I plan to use them for, be it documents or photos. These sheet protectors are indeed heavy weight. These are high-quality sheet protectors. I've been using these sheet protectors to organize everything from recipes to articles to scraps from my crafts. These are not the heaviest sheet protectors out there but they are a good weight and seem to be durable. Plastic sheet material appears quite good.Overall, I am happy with this product and have no complaints. With these sheet protectors even if I cut the piece a tad bigger it will still go into the sheet protector (yay!). and these sheet protectors fill the bill. I've used sheet protector for years for my recipe binders but I never cared about the quality or their being acid free until now. These sheet protectors are great for so many things around our house. Pop them in a sheet protector and then into my binder. What can I tell you about these sheet protectors? What I received was thin standard sheet protectors that cannot be overloaded for fear of collapsing or tearing.They are used in our home for the purpose of the children's various reports throughout the year and as a catch all for my couponing when I am not in the mood to sort.

The sheet protectors allow me to keep the printed recipes relatively protected from spills and splatters so that I can have a conveniently organized recipe book without having to constantly replace papers.

I always need a few more sheet protectors, though, as my recipe collection expands, plus over time some sheet protectors get so grimy (despite wiping) as to need replacement.

These sheet protectors are well made.
