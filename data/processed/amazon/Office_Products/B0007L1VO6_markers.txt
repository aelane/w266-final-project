these markers are comfortable to hold with rubberized grip, and they dry quickly, thus minimizing the bleed if you write on paper. It will keep the markers organized, and it folds out for easy access to each pen.The pens deliver the ink evenly, and the ink absorbs into the paper immediately. I never thought of BIC Mark-It markers (or sharpies) as much of an art marker, but this pack is changing my mind.This is a 36 piece set of acid-free, fine point, permanent markers. I use permanent markers mostly for filling out information tags for gift boxes for my wearable art (jewelry). These are pretty nice, juicy-feeling markers. The BIC markers did not budge on either surface after baking. The markers work just as promised by the item description:"Bright color and smooth ink flow" - Colors are bright and the ink flows nicely"Fine nib is ideal for detailed marking" - The nib is the perfect size for lettering and drawing"Textured rubber grip adds comfort and control" - the grip is perfect and makes holding the pen easy. These markers have a nice pointy tip and write smoothly, but the best part is the colors! There are so many, and they're all great!Now, these markers don't feel quite as solid in your hand as a Sharpie, and the lighter colors also feel a little drier, so I don't know that they'll hold up as well over the long run, but out of the gate, they're dandy! I can't say whether or not these Bic markers last as long or longer than Sharpies, I haven't had them long enough. These are permanent markers but it states on the back of the package that they are not recommended for use on cloth. We have been using the markers for several months now, and we LOVE them. I'm not sure when markers started going the route of Crayola Crayon's and offering giant boxes with all the colors.What the title says is what you get. 36 markers in various colors, these are ?Bic Mark-It's, which for 'heavy-dutyness' seem to be slightly less than the Sharpie, but for use and 'finer' usage, they seem to be better suited.The case is great, popping open the clamshell is easy, and once in, another flap comes out, revealing all the markers. I used to use regular markers but after using these, I am hooked. These permanent markers are pretty bad! If you need permanent markers, STICK WITH SHARPIE! The markers are high quality and come in a lot of fun colors. These markers have a great tip and they are lasting a really long time considering the use they get. Since I already love the BIC permanent markers for their fine point, which makes it easy to actually write with them,rather than just coloring something in, their comfortable grip, and the permanency of their ink, it is a wonderful "plus" to have them in so many colors, as in this set.However, don't count on having a "case" if you're actually going to use the markers regularly: the "case" is the clamshell they're sold in. I have used these markers to make name tags, to write on canvas, cloth, vinyl, metal, plastic...and more! These markers have a really great selection of colors. The markers require a light or white background to be visible; they are not opaque, and so on the glass jar the lighter colors were nearly invisible. I have used Bic markers before, and they are reliable. These markers are longer lasting and they come in a big variety of colors. Be sure to give the markers a chance to dry (they dry quickly), otherwise, they might smear. These markers are acid free making them useful for scrapbooking and photographs. Don't shake these markers & BIC Mark-It permanent markers aren't recommended for use on cloth; however, if you need a fabric marker, these are greatCrayola Fabric Markers.There are hundreds of craft ideas for BIC Mark-It markers on their website: bicmarkit dot com. Love these BIC markers and highly recommend for the variety of colors and ease of use. I'll use these markers, of course, but I would have bought something else this time around. I love these markers! He has been using these markers for crafting ever since I received them (so far, considering he has used them a lot, the ink has not dried out yet [contrary to what other critics have stated]). What's also great about these markers, especially while a child is using them, is that the markers are non-toxic and the scent of each marker is not too strong. These markers are excellent for: art projects on poster boards, construction paper, or any other paper choice (probably not tissue though), labeling (stickies, files, CDs, etc), and just about everything else. I love markers...I love color, so when Bic's Mark-It Color pack came out, I was really excited! I use permanent markers all the time at the office, especially to make signs and mark documents. I actually took one of the brown markers (brown is probably the color I am least likely to use and there are 2 shades of brown) and kept coloring on a piece of paper until there was basically no color left-- just to see how long the color might last and it took a very long time  before the color was faded. I have been using the markers as a way to highlight smaller print items and to write with. These permanent markers are beautiful and the rubber  gripper makes them easy to use even with some arthritis in my fingers. The Bic markers are the best. Permanent markers are wonderful for coloring in small chips that may be missing from a vase or places where a bit of paint may be missing from a picture frame or chair. Some of the markers, including Tiki Hut Tan and Pink Flamingo, were darker than their cap coverIf I were completing a project that required copious amounts of color, I would probably turn to a Sharpie. I use permanent markers fairly frequently, and the reason I prefer these to other brands is that once dry, they don't seem to smudge or wipe off smooth surfaces as easily and they come in a bunch of colors. These markers get most of their points for the package. The Bic Mark-Its are great quality permanent markers. I would feel very comfortable using these markers on anything because of the acid free promise.I
