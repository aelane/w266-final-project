excellent phones. I hate cordless phones - a real pain. These phones are easy to set up and call clarity is great. My other phones were thicker and clunkier, so it takes some getting used to. Still, they are nice phones. The phones work great and I am very satisfied. The phones are light and comfortable and can be placed anywhere as the second phone is really just a cordless phone with a charging base. I bought these phones to use with anOBi100 VoIP Telephone Adapter and Voice Service BridgeI purchased at the same time. These phones have good sound quality, the features I want to use are pretty easy to configure -- just nothing at all to complain about. I purchased VTech phones when the AT&T phones I had began to have a lot of static. These phones have served me well for a few months now.

I know these phones do have substance to them because I already dropped one on my ceramic tile floor and it didn't shatter.

These phones are great - I got them to replace some panasonics whose battery life has gotten really short, and seem to randomly go dead for no reason even when charged.

Perfect phones to replace 2 phones I was using..
