The scan quality seems better, and the print quality is roughly the same as far as I can tell. It just take a few minutes.The quality of my prints thus far have been very good. Excellent quality prints, it's fast, easy to set up, the wireless is very responsive and the quality of the photos is fantastic! Canon is known for creating great quality images, they have developed this reputation over many years of high performance. What matters is the quality of black and white and photo printing. Print quality is average, color is nice, but picture not very sharp. For better quality prints, I will recommend a laser printer if budget is not a problem.

I'd sacrifice the quality for the better price.- Super easy setup. Print quality is excellent. Now I can print a quality, readable label which is far better than my scribbling with a marking pen. I fully enjoy Canon's quality and attention to detail. I tested low quality printer paper, high quality printer paper, and glossy photo paper, and matte photo paper. It produced very high quality photo prints. The quality of the scans was excellent. Print quality is outstanding for both photos and documents. Scan quality is very nice.Wifi setup was quick - push the wifi button on our router, along with the one on the printer, they talk, everything's good. Print quality is good for b&w; and color, and it's reasonably fast, though not blazing fast. As I was very happy with the quality of the prints I chose to buy the upgraded model. So quality is a much bigger concern to me than speed.
