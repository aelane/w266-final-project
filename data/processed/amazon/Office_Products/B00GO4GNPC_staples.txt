Neither of the Swinglines came with staples but luckily had a box on hand. I only had standard staples, but they work fine and I am doing all of my regular stapling (up to about 20 sheets). You don't get any staples, but you do get a coupon code for a custom skin. It takes regular staples only (no heavy duty ones). When I opened it up I noticed that they didn't even include even a few staples with it. It is also lightweight and uses standard staples, which didn't come with the stapler. I took some staples out of my old Occupations, Inc., Stapler. You don't get any staples and need to order the cover. No included staples, but no biggie; fair trade for the free custom skin. While it does not include staples, the best feature of this tool is the fact that it is customizable. Solid and not cheap although I was suprized that there are no staples at all so you are going to have to spring for that. You will have to purchase standard staples separately and you will find that the stapler will staple 15 pages without the staples bending and not going through the papers, and not the 20 pages that Swingline states it will staple.This is a nice simple sturdy Swingline model stapler, and Swingline includes a piece of paper inside that when you go to the Skinit website will allow you to choose a skin for your stapler at no cost to you. It uses standard staples. It does not come pre-loaded with staples, so you will need to buy your own.
