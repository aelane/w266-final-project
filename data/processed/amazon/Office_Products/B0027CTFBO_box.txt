I use this box as a handy food storage for taking items on vacation, food, clothes, media items, and more. Every box out there was purchased by someone, and if you don't care what kind of box you use and never pay for boxes... this product just isn't for you. "A box is a box is a box."True? A box is a box is a box. Firstly the box isn't totally flat on top, but once the boxes are full you should still be able to stack them just fine. Each box assembles in a snap:  just flip the flat box on its head, then pull the sides apart and you'll see the printed graphic assembly instructions printed on the bottom of the box (although the assembly process is so obvious, you really won't even need the instructions). Once packed, you have one good, strong, box that will hold a surprising amount of material (books, cd's, etc. The box is a hybrid between a US style "moving" box, that requires being taped together and taped shut, and the common "file" box, that folds together and creates a self reinforced container with hand holes. The Smooth Move Moving box is not a document storage unit, but designed for moving. This works well enough, but when your box is sitting there, waiting to be picked up, these small flaps are likely to pop right out of the handle sockets because there is no way to lock them in place. In one box, went a king sized comforter. Another box held about 12 pairs of shoes.To move a two bedroom home, you'll need 6 of these boxes, 12 of the medium size and 12 of  the small size. At about $5 a box and buying them in multiples of 8 it would take a minimum of $120 (24 boxes) to $200 (40 boxes) to move a small household. The box was reinforced enough to make it not seem like breaking apart with just a little weight. )I pulled the first box out of the carton, took a second to look at it and then proceeded to fold it up. They come flat in a huge box that weighs about 43 pounds. The large moving box here is meant for boxing up clothing, bedding, and other light materials. Depending on what you are trying to move, pick the box according to your needs. This is not the first "moving box" that assembles without adhesive tape. This Fellowes box does add a bit of innovation though. No, the box will not fail during its first use. However, if you re-use the box many times, and flatten the box after each use, you will see some tearing.Like previous "tape free" designs, this box is exceptionally easy to set up and flatten out. Right out of the box, they go together in under a minute and are ready to use. I know it seems weird to review a box, but these are great! The whole box comes flat, folds out in just a few seconds, has a very secure, attached, 'lid' and then folds back down for easy storage for reuse.They are fairly thick and durable as well. After unloading the box, the bottom of the box was wet, but the water had not penetrated to the inside of the box. Still, a great box! The box also has lots of areas for labeling it's contents printed on it. Fellowes box is made out of a single piece of cardboard, it requires just a handful of foldings before it is fully assembled, and its rugged and sturdy design is meant to protect even your most fragile and valuable possessions. Then I used the box to carry various items upstairs to storage. However, assembling a box is very easy and FAST. Every box takes less than 10 seconds to set up, and can be used right away. There is absolutely no taping involved to set up the box and the procedure is easy to figure out. Each box has instructions on the bottom and each side of the box/tab is labeled so you should be able to put the box together quickly and easily! I pray I never have to move again, but if I did, I'd consider using this as my primary moving box. This is a sturdy box for our heavier items like books and kitchenware. The containing box didn't break but that was only because I handled it gently and mine did survive the mail. Impressed with a box? An empty box at that? But for Fellowes Smooth Move Box, I just open it, and it converts into the box form by itself already. Each box must have weighed almost 30 lbs and these boxes didnt even bow down, even without tape. You just unfold the box and it's ready to go.They're made with pretty thick cardboard so these are pretty sturdy boxes. For once a box was designed with the user in mind.Assembling the boxes were so simple I didn't need instructions. After all it's just a box for crying out loud!Pros:Easy to follow instructions printed on each box (if needed).Very sturdy, will last a long time.A couple minor details makes them better then other storage/moving boxes, such as how the top "locks down" without the need for tape.Cons:Cost... hard to justify paying for moving boxes sometimes, but these are well worth the dough! I balanced the box between two tables for 2 days and saw no signs of stress or strain on the center of the box bottom (which was unsupported and which is where you'd expect it to bust open). I realize that almost any box can, but because these are all one piece, and can be assembled quickly they seem well suited for this. Then I guess it is a 5-star box!I have to admit, I have never priced boxes before - preferring to scrounge around and take whatever boxes were at work, the store etc. Also, the box has numbered flaps/sides for easy step-by-step assembly AND has drawn pictures on the bottom of the box to show you how to assemble the box.The medium size boxes are the boxes I found most helpful during our move (although we did not use Fellowes boxes when we moved, the boxes we used were approximately the same size as these boxes). They really are perfect for moving, much superior to any box I've used before, including official moving boxes, copier paper boxes, heavy duty IV fluid boxes, etc.They come flat-packed and go together in 4 to 5 seconds--just unfold and push the interior flap down onto the bottom. These are not your usual box, these are almost crates. The Fellowes box is self contained, easy to assemble,sturdy and no tape needed! So a box that would lock shut without needing tape was definitely of interest! You could easily flip the box around and it stayed locked shut. Great Sizes and each box holds a lot.UpdateOk.. It is a nice box for moving.Cons: Nothing too serious. One, although it is pretty intuitive as far as assembling the box, the instructions are on the bottom and not visible when you first view the folded-up box. Well, one would think that a box is just a box...until you try these. The box itself is numbered with the order to assemble it so putting it together is simple.-The size is great. This box is huge. You definitely couldn't pack this box full of books, but you could utilize it for light to medium weight items such as clothing, stuffed animals, pots and pans, or odds and ends from closets etc.The Cons:-It isn't overly sturdy. You couldn't pack this box full of heavy items. Hard to get too excited about a box, but here are my thoughts:Pros-easy to assemble, one piece including lid, refolds flat as single piece for storage until reused, strong.Cons- locking closure is not really that secure. This box is incredibly easy to setup. The box is medium weight as well as medium thickness.The advantage of not having a separate lid may also be a nuisance to some. Well-made, easy to assemble large moving box. Open the box, fold the box following each number one after the other, and put the last fold (number 5) into the hand holds.This last part was really great. Thus for this large box you could only pack lightweight items such as pillows or a comforter. Also the box they are shipped in is useful for storing large poster sized or larger framed pictures. Simply slide the flat box open and then push one piece of cardboard down and you're set.Third, closing doesn't require tape. Each box can be opened and ready to pack in 5 seconds. As the box opens the neatly folded one-piece bottom cleanly deploys, a downward push locks into place. (Each box can carry well over a hundred albums, safely and securely. When you open the box you need to remove the small flaps from the handholds and open all four flaps on the top of the box. The box was so easy to put together that it threw me for a minute! So what is there to a moving box? The box itself is well assembled, but not as heavy a quality as the extra-strength banker's box. I'm not really mechanically gifted, but it was plain as could be, once I uncollapsed the box, that all you had to do was push straight down, and then bend the inside flap straight down to make a second, complete floor for the box. Once the box is expanded, just fold down the flap that forms the bottom. This is by far the easiest box I've ever put together. Just don't expect it to hold if you turn the box upside down or even sideways.I like that the boxes can be folded flat for later reuse, though it took a few minutes of head-scratching and trial pushes to get it to collapse again. It's a box and it does its job. When you take it out of the box, it just pops right open like a kid's pop-up book, and you're ready to go! The box takes under 10 seconds to set up. Not much can be said about a box. Really easy to create the box, and they are very sturdy. I got a box of eight (8) of Fellowes medium moving/storage boxes, in the 16 x 18 x18 size. Now I can just unfold a box if in a jam where I need an extra carrier, place some towels on the bottom, and keep the cat in the box. This box is the best package box I have ever used. Other than that, this is just a great box that I can recommend to any one.
