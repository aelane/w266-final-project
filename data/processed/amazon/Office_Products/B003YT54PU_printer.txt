This is a great printer. Unlike the MF5770, this printer can perform all its functions through a WiFi connection. The printer apps are even better. This printer is my first using wireless technology. This printer is essentially a stand-alone computer, connected to all of my other devices through the internet. This printer is highly recommended! Even though I received the printer two months ago, I just recently set it up. This was not because the printer is hard to set up, it's that I'm underwhelming able to set up machinery.Anyway, we got it up and printing and all registered with the HP powers-that-be. First, the high: this is an all-in-one printer clearly designed to serve a small workgroup. The printer was acquired, but despite being forced to get this one, the Technology department couldn't figure out how to set this up so you could print wirelessly from the iPad or iPhone (the only purpose of the printer purchase in the first place). The printer sat abandoned in our conference room for the better part of 2 years until they were doing Spring Cleaning and asked if I wanted to use this as a dedicated printer. Like any wireless printer, you need a WiFi network set up in order to accomplish wireless printing to it. The printer works great in OS X and in Windows without delays or errors.The printer does a great job at full-duplex printing. I have never had a printer, even the ones I use at work, that could double-side print. Having it come straight out of the printer double-sided is invention at its finest.And the print outs are fantastic.
