This way the ball will stay ready for you to use.Keep in mind the rubber bands on here are medium size and designed for small tasks.If you need to band together something say thick like several file folders or larger items, get the FILE FOLDER RUBBER BANDS, they are very strong, I use them for holding file folders and even large zip-lock bags together.Highly recommend this Rubber Band Ball! It's a really convenient and attractive way to have a supply of rubber bands on your desk, much better than just having a wad of them in your desk drawer.Time will tell, but one concern I have is that these bands will last so long that they'll become brittle before I get to use them. The ACCO Rubber Band Ball provides a convenient way to store and dispense rubber bands without leave messy and tangled bands. It's a nice, neat way to store rubber bands. This is by far the best way to keep an assortment of rubber bands handy for use. A simple, fun way to use a classic product. There's no better way to keep rubber bands from taking over one's desk. A great way to store rubber bands so they are always all in one place. There is no better way to announce to coworkers and bosses that you are a nutjob slacker with OCD than having a giant rubber band ball on your desk. This is a handy way to keep rubber bands together. Another way I use them--which is really helpful--is opening plastic lids that have ridges in them (like juice or pop bottles). Granted you could just make one on your own, but that would be way to time consuming for me.

This way, there is no un-tangling to be done and all I need to do is remove one band one at a time.
