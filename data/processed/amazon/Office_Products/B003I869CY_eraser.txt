I would have liked the eraser to have been magnetized so that itwould stick to the white board.The product works, it just doesn't work well enough to deliver on it's packagingpromises. The eraser had a hard plastic handle which at first I thought was an improvement over the softer kind, if only because it was easier for little ones to figure out which side to use. the eraser is nice, but any cloth or even paper towels work too. It's a nice eraser (and washable), but nothing out of the ordinary. If you already have an eraser and cleaner you like (or if you're satisfied with a damp paper towel), you can just get the markers currently for less:Quartet EnduraGlide Fine Tip Dry-Erase Marker, Non-Toxic, Anti-Roll Cap, 4 Pack, Assorted Colors (5001-10M)andQuartet EnduraGlide Chisel Tip Dry-Erase Marker, Non-Toxic, Anti-Roll Cap, 4 Pack, Assorted Colors (5001M). The eraser for now, the spray cleaner for later, and four standard color markers that have thoughtfully designed caps with oddly shaped caps to prevent rollaway. The eraser is similar to the older ones, and it works fine. The eraser works as expected and the spray cleaner is good for getting off stubborn ink. The eraser is good, but the cleaning spray is excellent. The eraser works well and the spray is a great lifesaver when the dried pen doesn't want to come clean.So, no complaints here and nice new features to make our lives a little easier! The eraser and spray is handy too. The eraser and the cleaning spray are perfect.
