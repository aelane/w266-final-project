As I mentioned before, the print quality is excellent and the speed is pretty good too. On this print, the color is not so faithful to the original. But in the first print I scanned, the skin tone is very good. The print job looked and was handled perfectly by my XP-400! I dont like that you cant just print just black if the color ribbons need to be changed unless its my disfunction Also with my HP All-In-One, an empty print cartridge meant I could not fax or scan. The print quality is good enough for most needs (don't expect laser quality out of this guy), and the scans are decent quality. I can't complain about the print or scan quality. As for print quality, this printer is perfectly fine for printing basic color and/or black-and-white documents. The print quality is right up there with other companies if not better. The print speed is much faster than the older Epson printer had. The print resolution is up to 5760 by 1440 dpi while the Scan Resolution is up to 2400 high-quality dpi.It uses instant-dry ink and has the Epson Connecting software to instantly print wireless from computers and mobile phone devices.The easy to follow setup and product instructions are clear and easy to follow.Whether printing a word, excel, access, power point,  photo or internet  document this printer prints crisp smudge free and water resistant documents.I find the 2.5 LCD touch panel easy to use and like the PC-free printing with built-in card slots.Designed for simplicity, the affordable individual ink cartridges are easy to install and the product is very easy to use.This is an awesome, affordable product that is exactly what I was looking for.I hope you are as happy with it as I am.Enjoy!

I send print jobs to it and nothing happens.

I don't know--I started a big print job with two sets of cartridges, one nearly full in the machine and one unopened on the shelf.

The print took about five minutes to finish.
