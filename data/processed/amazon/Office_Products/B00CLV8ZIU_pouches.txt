It only comes with two pouches, so you may want to get a few pouches. Using the various pouches, I was able to laminate identification cards, registration cards, photos and important documents. That said, the pouches are not very expensive and they are available on Amazon prime, so if you are a prime member you can have more pouches on their way quickly. I wish I had bought some of the longer pouches for some art that had to be cut down. I have to pull it out while I am still working on getting the next pouches ready. Also annoying is that it comes with only two pouches and they are the same size. There are many different sized pouches you can purchase separately. THe pouches are quite inexpensive and are available on Amazon.In short, the Scotch Thermal Laminator, 2 Roller System, 16.06 x 4.25 x 4.96 Inches is easy to use and does a great job. It is designed to use with pouches ranging in size from 3 mils up to 5 mils thick. Even when the pouches come out they are cool to the touch. The pouches make the process easy even if, like me, you aren't that coordinated. However, it only comes with two pouches and pouches are kind of expensive. I ordered the "pouches" from Amazon and they cost about 13 cents each.
