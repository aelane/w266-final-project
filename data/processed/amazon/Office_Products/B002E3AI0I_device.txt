I like that the UBS slides into the device for storage. This neat little device makes for much easier presentations. So bare with me.This little device is ergonomically designed. Just make sure you turn the device off before placing it back into the carrying case.The price may be a sticky point. Good-a low-power device. It's a weighty little device with an ergonomic design that makes it very comfortable to hold. I would think that a device with just four buttons could find something better to do with one of them than just make the screen black.Now a 1 GB flash drive can be purchased for almost nothing so I'm not sure how Kensington came up with a price point of $75 but that definitely makes this a luxury pointer. This device uses RF signal so line-of-sight is not necessary. It's a nicely sized device with a slot at the base of the device that lets you store the included USB receiver (that also happens to be a 1GB USB Flash Drive)The "Presenter" had a nice tactile feel to it and it's ease of use will be appreciated. The device is a bit chunky in size even though it is relatively small. Unlike the Gyration device I own, this is thankfully an easy process and the Kensington Wireless Presenter feels much sturdier overall. The Kensington device, in contrast, feels very durable and its simplicity should aid its longevity. The device is comfortable and exceptionally easy to use. The closer one gets, the less one is required to point the device directly at the host.Ergonomics:  The presenter is comfortable to hold, use and maneuver. Something to protect the device when I throw it in my bag.

The device feels much like holding a laptop mouse; comfortable in the hand but small enough to slip in your pocket.I also like the fact that the laser is green instead of the standard red.In summary, the Kensington Wireless Presenter is priced too high for the casual user but its quality design and durability make it a valuable tool for a practiced presenter.

This device is a revamping of an older design that proved very successful for Kensington and they were smart to build off of that without doubt.

The device was ready to use straight out of the box thanks to the included batteries.USB Receiver/Storage Device:  Conveniently stores in presenter body.
