There's 3 different colors and 3 folders of each. The colors of these folders are nice, soft shades of blue, green and brown.Although I like this product. These come with three each of three colors, but other than the larger tab space they are essentially the same design as any other inexpensive bulk buy manila file folders but are just a step above construction paper in weight.These will be used for school work since we have them, but we will not switching over to Smead MO (My Organizer) system products.CFH It's nice that these were in 3 colors but they are very light pastel shades so there isn't a lot of difference between them. I like the muted colors and the thickness of the folders. The colors are a little institutional looking but it's not a big deal. The three different colors of three folders in each color, each group with a tab top-left, center and top-right, have a more professional appearance than those of the fifty-pack of school-colored folders available in bulk packs; compare how many folders you need with whether or not you care what color they are. I love the colors and I like the oversize tabs. They are nice muted colors and will work in any standard file drawer. I like the different colors come in a package together instead of having to buy a box of each color. I wasn't impressed with any of the colors, as they are all kind of boring.QUALITY: The brown one is a little sturdier than the other two, but they're all typical thickness. They are pretty colors, but their "over sized" labeling area will cover those from plain folders. The colors are soft and distinctive and include pale blue, pale moss green, and camel.The page of starter kit tips baffles me. The colors don't necessarily pop like some might like but that's all really just a matter of taste.
