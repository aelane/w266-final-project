The tape is lightweight, but strong.The dispenser keeps the tape end in place where you can see it easily and ready for the next use.The cutter works very well.There is no pulling or struggling with the tape.There is no making mistakes. I think this is the perfect tape for anyone, young or old, but especially old, really old. Seriously, is a great tape for those in the 80+ crowd -or if you have any problems with pain in your hands, as it peels off very easily. (This is the perfect tape for Grandma).The other "selling point" of this tape, according to the marketers, is that it is really quiet, "especially important in an office setting". I use this tape all the time to mail things. If you've ever bought the cheap tape in the hopes of saving some money, you discovered why saving money sometimes just isn't worth it - either the tape doesn't stick when it should or the darn tape dispenser is so frustrating to work with as it doesn't prevent the tape from sticking to itself.This tape and tape dispenser makes preparing packages easy. It is very easy to use and the tape comes off of the dispenser very easily and then cutting it to the length you need is a snap. It's very quiet when the tape is dispensing. And it's easy to "pick up" when the tape falls in on itself and you need to pick it up to get rolling again. So yes, this tape is an improved packing tape and recommended. I am not sure if this tape cost more then the regular (probably does), however my ears now, and family, are at peace when I am packaging boxes preparing for a big move. Packing tape is often a bane of my existence. The tape sticks very well and securely holds the package together with a nice, strong tape that doesn't start fraying at the edges or get bunched up to where you have to use a lot more tape than should be necessary. The tape tears nicely and so far has not come off the holder to where I've had to search with my fingernails to pry it loose. You name it, this tape solves my problems. I'm not sure that tape being quiet as it unspools is a very useful trait, but it is neat none the less. The tape works well and I will purchase it again for all of my packing needs! This tape comes with a dispenser/cutting blade, which cuts well. The tape is much quieter than other brands I've tried, which is a big plus. This tape, while it unwinds easy and is easier to start, isn't something I'll use on a regular basis. This tape is strong and easy to use. It isn't hard to get the tape off the roll as it is with some cheap tapes. It's just good tape. So overall, yes this is great tape, but I'm not convinced I even need tape this nice. The tape comes off the roll as if there was no adhesive there. It's not a tape gun, but a full-size tape gun is a bit excessive for around-the-house and mailing-type taping that we use this for. Yes it is just packing tape, but for anyone that does a good amount of shipping, its an improvement in my opinion.Amazon's price seems to be competitive, especially if you can add it in to an existing order using Free Super Saver Shipping. Amazingly, it is perfectly quiet, as promised, and is the same nice, stiff tape. Once I got it, however, the tape was quickly laid in perfectly straight, neat lines on the package with no fuss or muss. I use this tape all the time. The tape is strong enough to hold most medium sized boxes together for shipping. It's what shipping tape should have been all along, frankly.As for the dispenser, it's nothing fancy, but it should be enough to get the job done. You may end up pulling the tape out by hand, then using the blade to cut or just transferring the entire roll to a tape gun.The tape itself seems to be slightly less sticky than standard shipping tape but it has no problem staying attached to standard cardboard boxes and envelopes. This tape peels off the roll with no effort and is a pleasure to work with. I don't know how they have managed to make the tape stick so well to a package but come off the roll so easy, but whatever they did it is a great improvement. This is very good tape. Otherwise, it's packing tape and does what it's suppose to do. We ship fairly often and use a big tape dispenser. The tape starts easily, just like Scotch said it should. Big plus is with the tape dispensers/tape guns, the tape often sticks to the dispenser, these don't to that.The tape seems to stick very well. The tape is sufficiently sticky that it doesn't readily pull away from bare cardboard (unlike storage tape which is supposed to) and yet not so sticky that accidentally sticking it to the box or itself renders the strip you just pulled wasted.Additionally, the tape tears/cuts easily enough and the dispenser makes quick work of packaging large amounts. The tape gun I have is made by 3M. The tape often gets tangled and stuck and wastes a lot of tape during the cutting process. Cutting the tape at exactly the right length is very easy to do. As advertised, the tape unrolls quietly. I have to use the tape often, mailing packages and books frequently. This tape is excellent - it's stickability works well and the noise level is lessened than that of the normal tape that I usually use.It's worth a try, although I'm not sure I would pay more for it, if it came down to it. First, the tape starting end was loose and with no sticky coating so it is very easy to get the tape out and started. The tape itself works very good. So, you can use the tape and feel pretty confident that it will hold the box together. Impressed with the tape so far. This tape isn't dollar store stuff, it's premium quslity. But you really do get what you pay for, even with packing tape. I've struggled with cheap tape that "strips" down the roll, making an annoying diagonal, wasting yards and making me aggravated.This tape is easy to locate on its roll, it doesn't fight back when you use it and is nice and strong. I formerly bought shipping tape from USPS, but I like the convenience with this dispenser and the durability of the tape itself.I also think the price is quite reasonable.The tape stays neatly on the dispenser. I'd also like to mention that this tape is made right here in the U.S. and is another reason I will be buying it i the future.I am very satisfied with this product and recommend it highly. This tape comes with about a 3/4" 'starter' that is non-adhesive, so when you start the roll, you won't risk getting the tape stuck to the plastic dispenser. Packing tape that comes on a convenient dispenser. This Scotch / 3M tape is nice and thick so it is very easy to cut and use without the problems that come with thin inexpensive packing tape.Good stuff, I would certainly buy it. OK, now having said *that* I will say that it works fine, seems very strong and I much prefer Scotch tape over various store brands (like Staples, to name one). If there is, I'm too lame to figure it out!Anyway, it's great tape. But I use tape a lot and, while I only use Scotch, I am still seeking the Nirvana of dispensers :)CONSUMER ALERT: By the way, I noticed that on the page where this review appears, a vendor is selling the tape for $4.20 and charging more than $6 to ship it. It's tape. The tape tears and then sticks to itself and takes forever to get unstuck, and the noise it causes when you pull out the tape is very loud. The tape just glides out. The tape, for this purpose, is useless. I then tried what was left of the US Postal Service tape (looks the same), and it held perfectly. This is the same tape and dispenser in use in mailrooms across the country. This tape is something everyone should have around the house, its so handy!!! Its tape it did its job for me it tape well and the roller which it is on did well also This tape has done its job well and has been convenient to use for the light packaging needs I have. Because it doesn't stick to itself nearly as strongly as similar tape I've used, you don't have the problem of fumbling to get it started. The tape is not as thick as I've had with other Scotch brand packaging tapes, but the adhesive is still pretty good and serves its purpose well.I wouldn't use this if you do a lot of shipping in volume. Very strong tape that is easy to unwind and cut. I'd definitely buy this tape again. This tape is good quality and holds well. I would give the tape 5 stars and the holder 2 stars. This is wonderful strong tape in a useful dispenser.It's everything you want, and I would definitely get more in the future. This will now be my "go-to" tape for mailing or shipping packages. It worked well enough, but I had to make sure to press the tape firmly after I put it on my packages -- it seemed as though there were always air bubbles that made it look less secure than I felt it should be. Not so with this Sure Start tape. Now that I've used Sure Start, I don't worry about the tape coming undone while my packages are in transit.The product description says, "It unwinds with a low noise that is great for the office environment." Scotch "Sure Start" Shipping Packaging tape rolls over the competition and wraps them up for good. 9/4/2011:  To update, this tape has been used to tape boxes for shipment of recyclables for the Terracycle program for my son's school and it has performed well. While the tape does pull off more smoothly than other packing tape, I find it does not stick as readily to the surfaces I am trying to seal. This tape does not seem superior. This tape has excellent strength, I used it for some regular packing and some problematic bundling of discards and it held like a champ. Once the tape runs out, the holder is trash! This tape is true to its word. I like how heavy the tape is as well as how easy it is to find and pull the end of the tape. I have to sneak outside to unroll the tape to avoid waking everybody up.So the Sure Start Shipping tape is a godsend. That doesn't happen with the Scotch Sure Start tape. This tape is a bit thicker than other tapes and comes off the roll easily. The tape is exceptionally clear and you can tape right over your addressing without worry about loss of readability. The tape's action is unbelievably smooth and quiet. The tape is specially formulated for a wide temperature range anywhere from 10 to 120 F so you can pack your items safely from the chills of winter right through the sweltering heat of summer. Also with this tape it's clear so it's great to place over labels to keep them from fading. I would highly recommend this tape to everyone who has packaging or storage needs. The tape is good and clear, thick, and comes easily off the roll. Well, the tape does start well, in that they've cut a serrated edge, which also is not sticky.

With other tape, you can use two or three passes of 1.88" tape.

@highlight

Do that with this tape, and you run the risk of it pealing off itself in transit.And while the adhesive seems to stick well enough to cardbord during my usage, I have my doubts that it will hold up as well in a high-humidity situation.Isn't the whole purpose of tape to stick?

@highlight

It may make this tape less frustrating to use when it accidentally re-rolls itself during taping, but is that really the most important feature of a tape?I'm sorry, but I just can't recommend this tape to anyone using a box with seams longer than about 6 to 8-inches.
