The idea is that you can cut any length label you need. Leave it to Post-It to come up with the idea. What a great idea! This is a great idea, simple as that. What a great idea -- take the sticky section from the Post-It and make it into a roll! Brilliant idea to have removable labels come on a roll similar to tape. I love the idea that it's easy to get the size of piece that you need but if it doesn't stick then it being a post-it does me no good. I love the idea and the fact you can cut this off at the length you want. Yet another great idea from the folks at 3M! Post-it Super Sticky Label Roll (in Green) is a great idea when you need to label things of various sizes, materials, and especially if you need to move the label multiple times. The idea is relatively simple.
