This printer features not only a high per page speed, and both wireless and ethernet networking, but also a small footprint and, most importantly, relatively high capacity ink refills for prices that make the per page cost competitive finally with lasers.After using this printer for a while, and outputting letters and labels and all the rest, I can say it's a great printer, easy to set up -- very much like my recent Epson color inkjet in that regard. But this is an amazing printer that, happily, is available at a low initial cost with reasonable per page costs on refills. This printer uses only black ink, so you won't get color with this printer. I did have to use a printer cable to install it. This printer doesn't make copies, fax, or copy duplex. This is the perfect printer for that!I print coupons online, and I hate wasting my color ink to print them. This printer is excellent for printing coupons online.It is limited printer, and if you are aware of what you are purchasing, then it is a great printer for what it is. All in all, it is a great printer for the price and I would definitely recommend it as a good alternative to a four colour model. )It's a nice compact printer, but Epson's "Better than Laser" pitch doesn't fly.- - - Ink Cost: It Adds Up - - -Over 5 years, you could pay $480 to $1000+ in supply costs. If you never use the printer past 24,000 copies, your actual cost per page would be 3.1 / 2.0 / 0.6 / 0.5 cents.Supply prices are average amazon prices for Jan - March 2013, sales tax not included.Note SB2:-----------Speed tests do not include set-up time for the first page.The test page was a busy landscape-mode page with lots of size 9 font text and a 5" x 6" graphic. This printer is it. Great printer-- highly recommended for your basic workhorse printer. For my next printer review, I am testing out the Epson WorkForce WF-M1030, a budget priced printer that focuses on those who don't need color and those who are on a budget and does not want to spend over $100 on a printer.Sure, I will always recommend for one to spend the extra $25-$75 for an Epson WorkForce printer such as theEpson WorkForce WF-3540 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer, Copier, Scanner, 2-Sided Duplex, ADF, Fax. 2.0 A - B Cable 6'.The printer gets the job done, it's quick and it's a very good monochrome printer for under $90. However, this Epson WorkForce printer pretty much matches the lower end laser printer when it comes to both the print clarity and speed. It is also a very compact and efficient printer that is ideally suited for a small or home office.The setup of this printer was very straightforward. Unfortunately, this printer doesn't work with AirPrint - I really would have liked to be able to print from my iOS devices as I primarily use them to view content these days.The print quality was indeed really good, and a casual glance could not distinguish it from the laser prints. The printer is a bit noisy as it starts the printing job, but otherwise not too much of a nuisance.Unfortunately this printer doesn't come with copying and scanning features, something that has become standard with most printers these days. I like this printer well enough, but its many shortcomings don't make it unique enough for me to wholeheartedly recommend it. All I wanted was a basic printer for my day to day needs. (It really is not necessary: Windows 7 recognized the printer immediately, and the only thing that came up on the monitor was a link to the manual which is online. But I do recommend this printer as it is very easy to use and the quality is very good. Love this printer to print just coupons so I don't have to buy all the colors too. I am pleased with this printer. I was looking for a basic printer to just do text outputs and draft copies of brochures. The Epson WorkForce WF-M1030 Wireless Monochrome Printer C11CC82201 is a great supplemental printer, in addition to your colored ink-jet or laser printer. The printer's paper feed is conveniently located at the top rear of the printer, simply place the paper on the tray and you are good to print.Set-up: the WorkForce WF-M1030 was easy to set-up. Once the printer has accepted the password, you are now connected to your network wirelessly and you are now ready to utilize the printer's wireless printing functions. Integrating this printer wirelessly with my network proved a little bit on the tricky side. A great printer to supplement your regular color inkjet or laser printers where it meets your less demanding printing needs. This very basic printer is a good choice for those who don't often want to print in color. The printer's software can only be installed on the computer's C drive and since we have a solid state C drive and are trying to limit the programs on it I would have like to be able to install  it on another  drive. I was excited to try out this printer, as I have owned other Epson printers and LOVED them. Also, when we tried to set this printer up it completely messed up my Epson Artisan, and my computer now has difficulty printing on that printer as well! It is not, however, a work-horse printer like we need. I was intrigued by this printer because a monochrome inkjet is a rarity, and I don't understand what niche this printer fills that a monochrome laser printer does not do better. Plus, this printer suffers from issues that usually affect inkjets, namely smudging of the ink. And finally, this printer arrives with a smaller, starter print cartridge that is rated at about 200 pages, rather than the 2400 of the big fat one that it can be replaced with. Overall a great little printer for the money and highly recommended... : ) The printer is a small form factor so we have even used it as a portable unit. So here comes, this Epson WorkForce printer pretty much matches the lower end laser printer when it comes to both the print clarity and speed; very compact and efficient printer that is ideally suited for a small or home office. The printer comes with a single small cartridge that is sufficient for about 200 prints. We like this printer well enough, but its many shortcomings don't make it unique enough for me to wholeheartedly recommend it. This printer meets it's intended purpose with serious speed for crisp monochrome wireless printing. This is a secondary printer for me and was necessary to give me the best of both worlds in printing. When I discovered this little monochrome printer from Epson, I knew it was exactly what I needed.Thankfully set up was incredibly easy. I anticipated the entire printer set up process to take a bit of time, & was pleasantly surprised by how smoothly & quickly things progressed. Once set up was complete I immediately put the printer to use printing out my usual shipping labels & paperwork. It is the best printer I have ever owned! Here are the PROS and CONS of this printer as I see them:PROS1. This is a good printer - it produces quality pages, fast, and it was easy to set up with my network. (Granted, my old printer was an 11-year old Samsung ML-1430 which was totally incompatible with printing by WIFi; besides, said printer's ink cartridge was about to run dry and I was reluctant to shell out $80 for a new one. For what it's worth, this printer doesn't do AirPlay either.There you have it. I set my printer up to save ink in the preferences area, so it may get more than 2400 pages. I powered on the printer and installed the ink cartridge and had to wait ~ 5 minutes while it "primed" the cartridge for use. I connected the printer via CAT5 ethernet cable to my 803.11b/g/n Belkin Wireless Router with 5 Port Switch. Once the printer was ready, I printed off a couple of pages in draft mode and in less than 10 minutes I was up and running.A few side notes:  As of today (March 2013) this printer does NOT support AirPrint with mobile devices. So, you CAN connect this printer to your network via ethernet, USB or WiFi, however you will not be able to print from your iPad or iPod/iPhone (WHY, EPSON?). Turning your printer on and off and going extended periods between printings will dramatically lower your individual yields on your cartridges.When all is said and done, this is a fine economy/value printer that installs easily, prints black and white at a low average cost per page and has networking capability. But, if you're looking for a printer for printing large volumes of plain documents, this is a fine option. Maybe it's just more convenient to have another printer at one end of the house. I wouldn't necessarily suggest this as your only printer, unless you never, ever ever print in color, but for a backup option, this is great. However, if you just want a basic black and white printer that you can set up anywhere in your house then GET THIS PRINTER! This printer receives five stars from me because it does not make false promises. However, for what it's worth, this is the perfect printer for a small home office or small business printing forms for quick signature. When I received this printer, I feel so dump that I bought the Samsung. This Epson printer does the same thing: Monochrome printing with better bang for the buck. I do have to say that it was really complicated and not easy, at least for me to get it set up wirelessly and I ended up getting frustrated with that and just using a printer cord instead, which works fine. A black-only printer might be the solution for those who do many drafts or may simply need to print some correspondence.This is a fairly compact printer for 8.5" paper or smaller sizes. The printer presents available wireless networks, you type your network password into the setup utility, and a few clicks later you're ready to print a test page. The printer is a little on the loud side, primarily because it's moving quickly. On nosing around on the printer control page, I found a quiet mode (which makes no discernible difference) and a high-speed mode (which was turned on by default). The printer looks almost like a retro typewriter with the paper inserted at the top of the printer. The printer itself is small. Unbox the printer, remove the blue packing tapes, turn on the printer, pop in the cartridge and be patient. I finally hooked the printer directly to the modem and got WiFi connections with my computer.3. This little printer does not have a duplexer, so I cannot print on both sides of the page unless I choose to do so manually.OVERALL:Nice black and white print, but I suspect that I'll use this little printer less often than my Artisan printer, even though I might spend more for ink.Three stars! I was thrilled to get this printer to have just black ink! This is truly a state-of-the-art printer. The printer operates on WI-FI so it can be located any place that is convenient. This mono-chrome printer prints very sharp and crisp copies. We are very happy with this Epson printer and recommend it for all of your non-color printing needs. Frankly, if this was the only Epson printer I have tested, I could have given a higher score. The printer is fast, and except for fine art or some PDF files the quality is top-notch.However, as soon as I opened the box I felt the cheap design. Great little printer! Otherwise, the printer is well made and lightweight.Although the Amazon description highlights the extra capacity cartridge that prints up to 2400 pages, this printer ships with the standard size cartridge. Even though this is a very basic, bare-bones printer, it's going to do everything I personally need in a printer and it will save me quite a bit of money in ink. This printer is the smallest printer I have ever owned with the smallest footprint. That's because it is a single-purpose printer. Also, the printer is pretty slow if you print in full quality. Even though this is a wireless printer, because there is no LCD input panel on the printer itself you must add the printer to your wireless network completely on your computer and using your wireless router. When I moved the printer closer to my wireless router, set up was successful so I believe the wireless card inside this printer may not be as powerful as other Work Force printers I own. Be sure and let it do this, without turning your printer off until it is complete.Printing is very fast and this print quality is quite good. Not much not to like about this printer. If you need a basic printer for lots of text documents then this should fit the bill nicely.On the negative side, the price point is on the high side for a black and white printer and the ink cartridges are a little pricier than cartridges my other Epson takes. This is a nice little simple printer if you're only needing to print in black and white. I was surprised and disappointed since my other Epson printer connected easily to wi-fi.UPDATE: My other issue with this printer is that if you run out of paper, then reload, it begins the print job all over again from the first page, at least with my computer and my husband's laptop. Open printer box and set printer on shelf. Make sure printer plug can reach outlet.Begin to unhook and re hook up all tangled twisted cables and cords on computer. Well, yeah, but they don't tell you the printer comes with the normal size cartridge (about 800 pages ?).T
