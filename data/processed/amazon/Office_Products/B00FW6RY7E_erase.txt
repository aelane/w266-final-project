The dry erase feature works well enough. It includes a dry erase pen with an eraser tip and two magnets which I rarely use.It's a great way to leave notes for families on the go. I have a smaller one of these dry erase boards, and it is similar to this. Still, as a dry erase board, it will work well, and that was the need I wanted to fill. I put this dry erase board on my stainless steel refrigerator. This dry erase board goes with the other Quartet products and it is as chic as the picture looks. This cute little dry erase board found a home on the wall near our door. This small dry erase board has a nice metallic (and magnetic) surface. These dry erase tiles are nice, and I like the colors they come in - it's great to have some variation from the usual white. Also, the dry erase marker that came with the board was almost completely dried out when it arrived. I ended up using another dry erase marker I already had. This dry erase board was not what I expected. I was expecting a dry erase surface that attached to my fridge via magnets. The magnetic referred to with this dry erase board means the magnetic front so you can stick magnets on it, NOT magnets to attach it to your fridge. The dry erase metallic silver board is great to use in the home or office. The included dry erase marker is black, shows up well on the silver finish. The dry erase surface works well.I had misread the ad thinking that the board came with magnets to stick it up. It's a silver dry erase board that is also magnetic. This dry erase board is an attractive alternative to the standard &#34;whiteboard&#34; with its metallic &#34;stainless-steel&#34; finish. I chose this dry erase board because of the size. The dry erase marker writes very smoothly on it and it's easy to wipe clean. We used both black and colored (red, green, blue) dry erase markers on it and they worked equally well.
