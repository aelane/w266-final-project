I needed a printer for my office, so I ordered this one to see how it performs. The printer is a bit bulkier than an HP or Canon, but I like it better because I have found Epson to be more reliable and to handle the paper better. The printer is also deeper than some, due to the mechanism at the rear that reverses the paper for two sided printing. The printer comes with a small paper tray (about 200 sheets), or can be fed manually from the rear. The printer comes with starter cartridges, and features four separate cartridges (good for saving money because only the ones that go out need replacing). The printer also installs a memory resident scan program called "Document Capture Pro", which I found to have less features than the Epson Scan, although it does offer a scan to PDF option.FaxingThe fax works fine, and has settings for allowing an answering machine to pick up before a fax is received. This is a large printer requiring a lot of space in your work area. After assembling the printer and turning it non you have to install the ink cartridges. That is not condemning this printer in anyway. The printer is now across the room alone which gives me more room around my desk. It fits perfectly on this printer stand I have and looks stunning to boot. This is the exact printer stand I have it on and it has plenty of room.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JIJTM8/ref=cm_cr_mts_prod_imgI love the Auto 2-sided copy and fax, because I disliked having to change the settings back and forth, especially when I was in a hurry and trying to fax documents.As a side note, I have a first generation Kindle Fire HD and I cannot print wirelessly to my Epson, only the newer version Kindles can print wirelessly.The Ink cartridges are different than any I've used before. I picked this printer up for my husband to use in his home office. It is a fairly large printer measuring 18 in. I hooked up the printer via the network, it went flawlessly. I used WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)  to connect the printer to the wireless router, so I didn&#8217;t have to enter the very long password. The best non-laser printer printing I&#8217;ve ever seen. Epson claims that this printer can lower color printing costs by up to 50%. In there it was set to local printer (probably because I do have another printer cabled directly to this printer), so I set it to Network, did an Add, it found the IP adrress, and I was done. This printer is really awesome! It feeds in nicely and relatively straight (I have never had a printer feed in paper from a document feeder perfectly straight).My iPhone also connected to it with ease and I could print straight from iOS to the printer. For a great all in one printer with an on par ink cost (similar to most high end printers; like the OfficeJet 8600 Pro) this is a great choice! If a printer is perfect in every other way, but I find myself constantly shopping for ink, I will hate it. I have an Epson XP-800 printer and I've been very pleased with it, so I was expecting this to be a good printer, too. It's not - it's a fantastic printer! I think the printer takes a moment to wake up from sleep mode. I have my printer set up for both direct USB printing and wireless printing. I did receive this printer free from the Amazon Vine Program, but I never fluff up my reviews. This is a very good printer. The printer comes out of the box and it only took me about 10 minutes to get unpacked and running. What is not to love about this printer. One printer replaced two for me and it is fast. All in all, this printer is a laser-killer and with Epson&#8217;s reputation of durability (no drums to get damaged) this one is highly recommended. * Epson Connect Services: From here, you can assign the printer an email address. First you have to register the printer with Google Cloud Print (see below comment). Basically, if you set this up right, your printer can send a scan to any email address you specify. * The printer has a horizontal paper tray cassette at the front, and an additional vertical paper feeder at the rear. Before I could attempt to use this, I had to run a printer firmware update for the printer. Why can't I just send a scan as a JPG directly from the printer to my computer? This printer was easy to install, and worked with our wi-fi without any special effort. This is a great all in one printer. Installing the printer went smoothly, for the most part. My other printer (more for home/office and personal) -- I could connect it to Wi-Fi without the CD. It kept telling me the printer was jammed even though it wasn't. Other than that, it's a good printer for a small business that wants almost laser-printing speed and quality without the price.Update: I printed another big job and it succeeded except for one thing. We finally switched to a Canon printer last year after many frustrating experiences with hp. We thought it was a great printer until this this baby arrived and blew it out of contention. The printer has a large footprint but should be suitable for a home office unless it is a very small home office. The printer design is very good provided you have front access to the panel. Once you have the printer unpacked and plugged in, you are ready to install the print cartridges. However, I let the printer do it's thing without interfering and it prints beautifully, so I guess the setup noise is normal for the WF-4630. The printer easily discovered my PC and scanned quickly with great results. If you were going to put the printer in a bedroom and use it while someone else was sleeping, it would not be the best choice (that is unless you want to bother them bahahaha). The printer is fast and prints very nicely. I really enjoy this printer and is everything I need. It's a solid little printer (slightly smaller than this one), but it has one HUGE letdown. I wanted to be able to put the printer anywhere in my home office without being tied to the computer. And this printer does that as well.Setup for WiFi was a bit of a challenge. I was not able to do it on the printer alone. But I was unable to get this printer to connect to my home network using just the interface on the printer (although the directions said I could). Much faster than my old printer. I would definitely recommend this printer! I needed a new printer, not because my was broken, but because it was so old and so slow, so when I saw this one in the Vine Letter, I jumped on it. I not only set the printer up by myself(barely glancing at the instructions) but my wifi works.There is a cd that you put into your computer to load whatever info the printer needs, and after carefully taking out all the packing from around and inside the printer, I plugged it in and answered all the questions my computer(Mac) asked me. The printer starts with English checked (shows this on the touch screen) but none of the keys will work and all report as invalid operation. The printer will not install without using the Epson CD. The printer was connected via my ethernet and should only needed to go to the internet for the latest update.Another issue is that you cannot load photo paper in the main paper tray. I have never seen a printer before that had this odd requirement. My less expensive Brother printer seems to print as fast and as good and costs 1/3 of what this printer costs. I cannot recall any other printer that had this problem.Considering the claims made for this printer, I expected a lot more. Overall I would not recommend this printer unless you absolutely require some of the features and can live with the idiosyncrasies. The printer was shipped in its original box. The printer then takes about 10 minutes to load the ink, and it must perform this task uninterrupted. I was able to add the printer in OS X 10.9 and Windows 8 quickly, and both operating systems then offered printing and scanning to it. This printer came in a very large box. The printer is large as the height of the unit is nearly 13.5 inches. Setting up the the printer to print from the phone was also easy. This may be the slowest printer we have owned in a long time. This is truly an awesome All-In-One printer for small businesses and homesWhen I first received this - I was a little disappointed since there were issues setting this up - after trying to fix over phone calls with Epson support - they shipped me a replacement printer (Very good service)Setup was really awesome - literally took me less than 10 mins to set it up and start using all the features.M
