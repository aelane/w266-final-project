I tried a few regular pencils and it sharpens them ok. I found it almost perfect for colored pencils, which you don't really want to be super sharp (you still have to dull the point a little). I found that it sharpened pencils (variety of brands...Dixon, Ticonderoga, E.F., etc.) Therefore, some pencils take several tries to get all the way sharp.Re-sharpening a pencil previously sharpened by this machine is much easier. ...at eating pencils. It tends not to sharpen pencils to as sharp a point as my persnickety self requires. There were a few pencils that I sharpened that had a little wood on the side, but it wasn't down to the very tip. It only sharpens standard sized pencils (hexagonal roughly 1/4 inch diameter - you know the Ticonderoga #2).I have an earlier, less cool looking, model of this pencil sharpener. I used this to sharpen 3 new pencils and a pencil that the tip was broken off of. All 3 of the new pencils stopped sharpening when the graphite wasn't even showing yet. I like being able to see how full it was--with new pencils it needed to be emptied after each sharpening, but it wasn't that easy to open. First, it is useful only for standard sized pencils. It sharpens pencils quickly and quietly. Dull pencils looked  new and sharp after just a second in sharpener. Sharpening colored pencils was non existent almost and after ten pencils, both colored and regular, the sharpener overheated. While it worked, it was very quick; it sharpened pencils in just about the blink of an eye. It also kept sharpening a good few pencils way past the time needed to get them sharpened, thereby wasting a lot of wood -- save the trees and all that. Some pencils came out looking like they could have been put on the end of the Wicked Witch of the West's nail tips and killed a few Dorothys, but most of them had an uneven shave and the wood came up to the very tip of the lead on one side.The worst part about this sharpener is that the top is insanely difficult to get off, and rather than break it I had to look at about 5 different websites before I could figure out how to open the darn thing.This may have won the design award but it's much like a dumb blonde -- great to look at but not much to offer in any other department. It is easy enough to use and get the pencils adequately sharp. I sharpened 12 pencils and of the twelve, only 5 were trimmed evenly around. If getting pencils electronically sharp quickly and easily, with a simple slide-in/slide-out is what you're after, you may be more satisfied with another albeit more expensive model. Good to be able to have sharp pencils again and recommend this sharpener as being well built, as well as being easy to operate while looking great on your desktop environment. And it DOES sharpen the pencils, but I feel that it's lacking in how it sharpens them.
