This is my seventh Epson printer and although it is not as powerful as either the Workforce 840 or 845 that I use frequently, it is excellent for a printer its size. I have found both to be excellent.This printer, unlike the WorkForce models, is clearly more of a photo printer than a high capacity document printer. The Epson Expression Home XP-850 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier & Fax is a solid and well built printer that has done everything I have asked of it, and done it well. Nothing about the printer called attention to itself in a negative way. It was a great printer while it worked. A printer that won't load paper is about the most useless thing you can have around.The original review follows:****************************************There is a lot to like about this printer. This is a compact little printer and would appear to be a good value, but it is NOT a good value, for one simple reason!It will not print a simple black and white article or page, if ANY of the color cartridges are empty, and this is clearly a ploy to force you to constantly replace the expensive cartridges, even when all you want to do is print in black and white. The printer seems durable enough. I think this is a great printer for the home or home office. The printer came with a CD which installed software on my OS X 10.8.3 system. Accessing the printer via its IP address allowed me to update the firmware with the latest version. I was quickly able to register the printer with Google Cloud Print and Epson Connect services, and it can be easily accessed from iPhone/iPad for printing as desired.Printing:First of all, the XP-850 has 6 ink cartridges including both black and photo black, and the printer delivers a 5760x1440 dpi maximum resolution (this is superior to the 4800x1200 of Epson's office printers) at a 9.5 ppm speed for black or 9 ppm for color. The printer has the ability to print directly on CD/DVDs that have that capacity, though I did not try this with the 850. I planned to use the Epson XP-850 to replace an aging Canon printer, an equally old HP flatbed scanner, and an antique Brother fax/copier. Since I had the printer too far away from my PC for a cable, I used the alternate method of locating my home network and typing the password on the printer's touchscreen. Then I challenged the printer with some color prints on some Epson 4"x6" glossy photographic paper. You can use the printer's touchscreen, but I preferred doing it with the software.I haven't set up the fax yet. The printer arrived very well packaged and took quite a bit of effort to get all the wrapping material and tape off of it. This is a good overall printer for the HOUSE, not a small business but for the HOUSE. I am positively thrilled by this EPSON EXPRESSION PHOTO XP-850 printer! This printer has three media trays:  cassette 1 (accepts 4"x6" or 5"x7" sheets, useful for keeping photo paper or small label sheets always loaded); cassette 2 (accepts letter size, A4, legal size, 4"x6", 5"x7", or 8"x10" sheets); and a CD/DVD tray that stores at the bottom of the machine, but is specially inserted when needed to print labels on printable discs.One feature that I don't much like, is that you must close the output tray (which opens automatically when something is printed or copied) whenever you load paper, photo paper, or other media in the trays. The printer has a rear paper feed slot for single sheet copying of card stock and other thick media. The printer does single-sided or double-sided copying, as requested. This printer does single-sided or double-sided printing automatically or as requested. This is the first printer I've owned that was capable of printing a label directly on a CD or DVD disc. This XP-850 printer uses Epson 277 cartridges (Claria photo ink), which are available in both standard and high-capacity sizes. Because the printer warns you whenever an ink cartridge is running low, it's easy to purchase ink to have on hand whenever a cartridge actually needs replacing.I haven't used this printer for long enough to know how often I'll need to buy ink, or how much extra the ink will cost over the long run as compared to "regular" ink. However, since I'll be using the printer as a dedicated "special media" printer (for CD/DVD labels, photo prints, and the other things it is specifically designed to do), I don't expect that ink replacement costs will be a significant factor for me.***FAX. Once you've added the printer to your network, you will need to install the printer software on each networked computer that will be using the printer. This EXPRESSION PHOTO XP-850 printer measures 7-1/2" high x 13-1/2" deep x 15-1/2" wide; thus it is small enough that I can find space in my home for this second printer that I'll use mostly for printing photos and special media.***CONCLUSION. This is a terrific printer for families who print a lot of photos and burn a lot of photo/video CDs/DVDs and make their own greeting cards. However, this little all-in-one printer isn't the best choice for an everyday "workhorse" printer, because it has small paper tray capacities and uses specialty ink designed for printing photos. That said, I genuinely love this printer, which does things I didn't realize I needed to do until I started using it. I still own myEpson Artisan 725 Color Inkjet All-In-One (C11CA74201)printer and it produces great documents for me. This newest printer from Epson is even better, though! The printer can accommodate pretty much any standard size of photo prints, copy paper, legal paper or whatever it is that you are wanting to print on.Everything you need to get started is right there in the box: power cord, phone cord, ink cartridges, installation disc, printer, and instruction manual. and get the printer powered up. This printer beats its predecessor, theEpson Expression Premium Photo XP-800, but only in photo quality. As best I can tell, this printer is identical in every other way. I have been happy with this printer. The printer GUI doesn't make it easy to find. The Epson XP-825 is a beautiful printer, both in appearance and function. The printer will also print on inkjet-printable CDs and DVDs. The printer didn't recognize my router's SSID when I went through the setup wizard.I
