The lead flows very nicely, and the extra erasers come in handy. They tend to break the lead often because they press too hard but the refills are generous and the erasers can be flipped to use 8 times before replacing. The lead extrudes at nice increment(s), and 0.7mm is a good thickness. The lead is strong, but of course breaks just like any other quality lead you have used. The 0.7mm lead is sturdy enough that my son does not have to keep advancing the lead, as he does with 0.5mm leads.The bright colors make these pencils easy to see in the bottom of the kids' backpacks, and they also appeal to my kids. These have 0.7mm lead without any cushion/spring, but like other 0.7mm mechanical pencils I have, they work fine without endlessly breaking the leads.Also, what is cool is that they come with generous erasers that flip upside-down to give you another fresh eraser.Additionally, the "starter" set comes with two extra erasers (4 actually) plus a package of 12 HB #2 lead refills.For the price, you really can't go wrong. They write VERY smoothly, the lead is very strong (I tend to break mechanical pencil leads when writing TOO emphatically), and the barrels are VERY comfortable to hold. Also, it came with extra lead. The .7mm lead is nice and dark so that I do not even need my reading glasses to see what I wrote. The lead is #2, so it is usable for students on standardized tests. 0.7 MM lead in container- 2 Replacement Erasers The lead advances nicely, no issues with that part of the pencil either. Normally, I use .5MM lead but this is just a bit better in terms of ease of reading what was written and sufficient darkness. The lead stays put until you need more too. When you reinsert it, the lead clicks out wasting the pencil. The lead case has a little slide at end of it...don't try for an hour to open a "lid" like I did. The lead is easy to dispense. The lead makes writes clearly on the paper, and the eraser removes the writing, the way it should. The lead is #2, and unlike many mechancical pencils I've purchased in the past, the lead seems much more durable. The lead is a semi-thin 0.7 size which is amazingly strong and dark for writing and comparable to a number 2 standard school pencil.The best part is the dual flip eraser. The lead held up to both beautifully in spite of a range of pressures and speeds.) This protects the lead and means you'll accidentally break off a lead piece while writing far less often.The other addition is with the flip eraser at the top. But not with these.Plus the lead does not break. They have thicker lead (.7) which I prefer.

I've always hated lead pencils.

The lead is put in by removing the double eraser.

The .7MM lead is just right for putting little numbers in little blocks unlike #2s that have to be sharpened often while using.
