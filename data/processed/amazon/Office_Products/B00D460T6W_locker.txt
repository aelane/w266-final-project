This LOCKER SHELF fits a 12" locker very well. You put it together inside the locker by placing the legs on either side, and then insert the shelf piece at an angle, and then rest the shelf down onto the legs. So if you have a 15" locker, don't buy this product. If your locker is only 14" high, don't buy this product.It's my belief that if you need a locker shelf, and you go measure the locker and this product will fit, and you buy this product and install it in the locker, you will be happy with this product and that you only spent about $15 to double the shelf space in your locker. I suppose in a locker it would be ok since it couldn't move but for anything else it's a dude. This locker book shelf is light, sturdy in the locker, and easy to assemble and dissemble. But it is easy to install in the locker and offers enough space for easy organization. There is a locker room in my office building. If the locker is even a half inch smaller, it doesn't fit in.

But all in all an easy to use and well crafted locker shelf.

My locker at my gym is a disaster with both a pair of workout shoes and basketball shoes tossed inthe bottom.

Once installed in the locker it was nice and sturdy.
