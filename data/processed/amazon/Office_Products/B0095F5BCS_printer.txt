This printer was shipped to me in its original Canon box package; the big box was not placed inside another bigger Amazon box.Having previously used Canon's excellent PIXMA Pro9000 Mark II printer, this Pro-100 printer has a number of differences and improvements over that older model. This is comparable to the previous Pro9000 printer. This printer's output quality is ideally suited for photos shot using a better SLR camera. After all, both this printer and the "Print Studio Pro" plug-in are targeted towards professional-level photographers. This printer includes a tray to hold a CD or DVD so you can use this printer, along with the included "Easy Photo Print" software, to easily print professional-looking disc labels. This printer has impeccable build quality, with an excellent fit and finish, and it is a very solid piece of equipment. This printer connection setup process is quite cumbersome, but its wireless printing is very reliable once it has been configured. A dye-based printer like this will naturally produce better color saturation than a pigment-based printer such as Canon's Pro-1 or Pro-10, or Epson's R3000. But a pigment-based printer will usually produce deeper blacks and dark tones. This Pro-100 is an excellent printer especially for landscape and nature photography because the colors are very rich and saturated. The printer is not changing the hues of the skin by adding too much red color, but the existing flesh tones, and all colors in general, may be slightly more saturated than what is depicted in the actual images when using a dye-based inkjet printer. If that is your preferred printer paper, instead of using a semi-gloss or gloss paper, then a pigment-based ink printer like the Pro-10 or Pro-1 may be better suited for your photo paper preferences. One at the very back of the printer, and one a bit forward of that. Recommended.I could not be happier with this printer. I expect this printer will be expensive to operate, but will delight all but the most critical on a daily basis. First off, let me tell you this printer is big and quite heavy! I couldn't get the printer to work. Once I did that I was able to get the printer working properly.This printer has 8 separate ink cartridges. I really like that this printer can print large sizes up to 13" X 19". I am really satisfied with this printer and would recommend it. I am thrilled to be able to test this printer. This printer produces very professional looking prints and is easy to use and set up. I chose this printer based on reviews, reputation (I am big Canon fan), need and the $200 rebate.After setting up (and I admit that it took me awhile to realize I was loading paper from the back feeder rather than the main one), I printed a photo on the Pro Luster paper they sent with the printer. Ideally the printer would have a transparency or vellum setting but the PRO-100 has neither. )Incidentally this is one big printer, on the order of my HP1 laser printer from 23 years ago.If you want to improve your printing expertise, I highly recommend the online training course "Inkjet Printing for Photographers with Ben Long" at lynda dot com. Amazon delivered the printer promptly, on a Friday afternoon, and as soon as I received it I began the setup process with high expectations.First impressions of this printer are that it is solid but very heavy, with a fairly large footprint. So far so good.Once the printer has been unpacked and the cartridges installed, Canon instructs you to complete the setup process using a supplied CD. This installs the printer drivers, some software supplied with the unit and establishes a connection to the printer using a USB cable or on a network. I was really happy with the printer at this point in time. He then asked me to remove the printer using Windows control panel and reinstall the software using the CD supplied by Canon. The printer uses 8 small printing cartridges and we will see how soon I have to get new ones and will update at that time also.Whether you print a lot of photos or just a few, the PIXMA PRO-100 is a highly recommended purchase for all. This allows you to put this massive printer in a side room or somewhere out of the way if you don't have a lot of room by your computer, and it also means all the computers in your house can easily use it to print without sharing it between computers.Printing on the luster paper samples that were included with the printer, I couldn't tell a difference in detail between this printer and my old Pro 9000 MkII. Also be aware that this printer is about 1" larger in every dimension than the old 9000 MkII which was very large.As far as home printing is concerned, I have won several contests with my old Pro 9000 MkII so it does a good enough job for prints. I then received this printer and printed it 8x10. This is a great printer, but if your colors are going to be really pumped up in Photoshop, you may have to use a different profile other than the one for the Pro-100 if printing from Photoshop Canon PIXMA PRO-100 Color Professional Inkjet Photo PrinterI purchased this printer from Amazon to replace a Canon Pixma ix6520 wide format printer. ; I have been testing this printer with Canon paper LU-101, SG-201, and PT-101. So if your printer hits an error condition, you have to count the number of times the green or yellow lights flash, then reference an online manual to figure out what the error condition is. No this printer doesn't have the sheer quality of the PRO-10 and the PRO-1, but it performs great for the price I paid. I also love that this printer has wireless capability and I feel it's a must due to its pretty big size; it's great being able to place in a certain area away from the computer (no need to purchase ridiculous length of USB cords getting in the way/take up a USB slot on your computer)I like that when you insert the ink, each individual ink area lights up to tell you it's in correctly.If you get this printer, I highly recommend getting theCanon Photo Paper Plus Semi-Gloss 13" x 19" (50 Sheets) (SG-201 13X19)too. I definitely feel this printer is a worthy investment. The printer arrived by UPS in a sturdy box, was wrapped in plastic and packed in foam with all movable parts taped down securely. The printer is quite large and heavy (about 50lbs) and will take up a bit of room. Assembling the printer consisted of installing the print head and dropping in the 8 ink cartridges. It is a bit complicated to set up, but once you figure it out, it is just like a regular printer. BTW, I couldn't get the Wi-Fi to work wirelessly and had to set the printer up via a USB cable. I was fine with the old printer. ; I did have to adjust my printer profiles a bit from the 9000.There is one downside to this printer and Canon's whole PIXMA PRO series. I admit that I was looking at the Epson 1430 printer, which does work wirelessly and is smaller and lighter. I set up this printer with my Mac system, and I did not encounter any issues. I did not own so many because I wanted to; however despite using a professional printer, each kept breaking (but I still like the print quality). This Epson printer used to give me wonderful black and white images with QTR setup. That is exactly what Canon has done: you first download the regular Canon printer drivers and install them as normal, then you download the printer driver update that's named "XPS". This solid large-format printer sells for what a letter-sized photo printer cost just a couple of years ago. But this is not a printer for casual use. It's now clear to me that they also know how to build a printer. Being a printer designed for more of a purist you will also want to run through some tweaking of the color controls using 4 x 6 paper before you insert that first sheet of pricy 13 x 19 paper. When it comes to a printer that has a purpose of primarily printing photo quality prints, speed is not a virtue, in fact a slower speed can assure more accuracy in the placement of the ink droplets. This printer to Canon's credit does not claim unrealistic speeds. Luckily, it's wireless, so I was able to place this printer in my spare bedroom.Set-up was a little frustrating. Also, you need to physically connect the printer to your computer during set-up. The printer really captures the colors of the image that I see on my computer screen. The printer can also handle art paper and I plan to use it to make prints of my dad's artwork.Overall, the Pixma Pro-100 is an excellent printer. While printing using this printer remains more expensive than using an online service, the image quality is so fantastic, that I still recommend this printer. This printer is a monster, in more ways than one. The printer uses eight (8) different ink cartridges, so I can see this as being a big expense in the long run.This thing took me over 2 hours to install and set-up! This printer is "designed for photo enthusiasts" and I can see it working well in a small office or shop where others can network into it with ease.If you're really into photography and are looking for a good printer, I'd recommend this. Turning printer on will be enough to prevent clogging with this printer.EPSON R2000 - MSRP $599PIGMENT based printer+Excellent quality on Fine Art & Matte paper+Very good color, but not as much pop/dynamic range as dye+Excellent black & white-Very good quality on Gloss, Semi-Gloss, and Luster paper-Non-matte paper requires an extra overcoat of gloss, which is one of the replaceable ink tanks. The printer works quickly and quietly and produces prints that can rival the pros.Pros:*Really beautiful color quality. ), but be prepared for this printer to take up a lot of space. I'll be using this printer for all my photo needs from here on out. This is a great printer for artists. If you just want a printer for your home that you are not going to use much, I would not recommend paying $500. It's so easy to use, and I love having a printer that also scans, copies, and more. But how do they compare to the much cheaper Epson printer that does so much more than print?I had both printers print the same photo--a picture of a tree's branches covered in pink flowers with the sun in the sky behind them--and I was surprised to see a noticeable difference. I would give this printer 5 stars for both.However...I had to take off one star for several reasons: it's very expensive; the inks for it are very expensive; it's difficult to set up; it's difficult to put printing paper into it; it takes up a lot of space; and it's a one-trick pony (although it handles that trick exceptionally well).Two other things of note: this printer, which was made in Japan, is a technological marvel and a work of art. And I don't think I've ever seen a more attractive printer, although the simplicity of the design seems to have led to a lack of clarity when it comes to how to use it.So there you have it. I used the printer connected directly via USB because the printers are all very close to my work PC. This isn't unexpected, given this printer uses many more inks to provide the results.The Pro 100 isn't amazingly better than the MP990, but the results are much, much closer to what's on screen. I probably won't be around to verify that either.Conclusion-The Pro 100 printer is a great printer. If you can afford the printer and not the Pro 1, don't fret. You're still getting a great printer that outputs stunning results. Each printer was, in that respect, disappointing.I have to admit to a bit of skepticism when setting up and testing the new Canon, however, my fears were unfounded. The printer is set up in my husband's studio on a home network with the router directly below. Fortunately, the printer and scanner share a six-foot table so accommodation was easy. This is the 3rd Canon printer that I am owning, the first being Pro 9000 Mark II which I bought in 2010 which was one of the best pro printers.Then I obtained the Canon Pro-1 printer - which offered very good quality prints but ultra high cost of ink replacements + the droplet size was bigger than that of the Canon Pro 9000.Now - the Canon Pro 100 Printer does the best of all the Pro Printers :(1) Reasonably priced - slightly more than the Mark 9000 and less than half the price of the Canon Pro-1 : Makes it very attractive for the price(2) Good quality prints :  The quality of the prints are better than both the Pro 9000 Mark II as well as the Pro-1.I
