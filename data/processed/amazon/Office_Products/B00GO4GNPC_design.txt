Nor is it particularly ergonomic, with a &#8220;boxy&#8221; design. I suppose I&#8217;ll like it more, once I decorate it with the design I selected (my favorite baseball team), but utility-wise, I doubt it will become my favorite stapler. It comes with One free Skin It design, where you can go onto that website and pick from the many skins...or design your own. I finally picked out a design that was &#34;good enough,&#34; and it arrived in the mail in 10 days.It was easy to apply. After I submit my final design, it took only a few days before my custom skin arrived. I like the design of this stapler, as with its flat face, I can also prop the stapler upright for a pleasing portrait that looks nice to display.One minor thing, is that the slightly raised &#34;CUSTOMIZE ME&#34; lettering along the top is visible, not very much, but only if you tilt it against the light and are really looking for it. I ordered a Hello Kitty Chococat design. They didn't adjust the design for the stapler. It is interesting to note that the design continues on the thin strips as if there were no space in between. Swingline has joined Skinit in letting you create your own design on your stapler. Once she had uploaded the design, she could adjust the design on her stapler so that the pattern was exactly as she wanted.
