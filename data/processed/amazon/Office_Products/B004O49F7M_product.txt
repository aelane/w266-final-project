What a great little product! I will definitly will buy this product again. Before I'd get half-way through the product, I'd have chopped off so much of the applicator to bypass the clogged tip, that I had no control of the product. This Scotch product is a 5-Star winner. I will definitely purchase this product. I'm very happy with this product...and well, remember..it's super glue.I'm not sure exactly how to describe it, but I feel that it is a great product for the price. I'd buy this product again. This is definitely a good product to have around the house - highly recommended! Good and helpful product!! This product works pretty well for that usage.Overall, it's a good product. It's been holding very well and I am very pleased with the product. "Super Glue is a very handy product, and I highly recommend it, but this packaging does not suit all needs. The product had been performing as advertised (dropper applicator worked fine and cap wasn't getting stuck). I have reached for this product a number of times over the past few weeks - rather than for the super glue I already had open - because I knew the applicator would enhance my results.I've used it to fix a piece of china, as well as to replace a pearl that had come loose on a brooch. All in all a decent product, but nothing which puts it light years ahead of similar products from Loctite and others. So, to sum up, this product appears to be easy to use (you do have to puncture the inner seal the first time), works, and does not dry up inside the applicator, at least not for close to a week. Excellent product. I highly recommend this product. What a great product. I highly recommend this product. I received this product in 2011 and used it, and used it again recently (over a year later). Good as new...Clearly this product a triumph of science and technology! This product addresses the one problem with regular superglue which is that it dries in the package and is difficult to apply precisely. We all know that Super Glue is a good product but it's always been a messy job.Not any more, someone has come up with a brilliant, simple idea and it makes using Super Glue a lot less of a mess.It's a new streamlined nozzle and the bottle has "squeeze points" so that only one drop is released at a time from the end of a longer and much narrower neck.I've used it now on a couple of jobs about the house and can't praise this product enough.Two pairs of sunglasses that would have been thrown out have been saved by repairs to the frames and one of them was at the thinnest point surrounding the lens - and the glue can't be seen, it's that tidy of a repair.Great product now in an easy to use bottle. Great product in an applicator which makes it much easier to use, with a lot more precision! Excellent product in an easy to use applicator. Very pleased with the product. A truly useful product any time you need a cyanoacrylate type glue. The Scotch Super Glue is one nice product. I like the product for general household use. I opened the product and put the cap on intending to use it soon.I left the room and when I got back I noticed the bottle had tipped over, I went to pick it up and it was stuck to my counter, I grabbed my knife to try to scrape it off the counter top and my fingers got stuck to the knife, it was very hard to get off.

Not so THIS product: I've used the glue in this container no less than 5 times and each time it's clog free and flows easily.

A+ for that product design!The Minus: Like regular liquid Crazy Glue, it's too thin.
