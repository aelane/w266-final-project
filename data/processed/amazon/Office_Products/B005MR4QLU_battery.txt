Cord charges the battery, but you cannot run the machine off of the cord. Specialized battery will eventually need replacement.Touchscreen - after using my iPad, the touchscreen required much more pressure and was not as sensitive and easy to use as I anticipated. I really did not like this short battery life (maybe I got a dud...), nor the inability to have it plugged in and in use.As for the software... it is very easy to use and in my opinion, preferable to the touchscreen interface.Adding my entire Outlook Address Book took 2 seconds and printing from the software was a breeze. The battery life, the lack of ability to work off AC power, the pricetag... all give me pause.For those who need a basic label maker and yet really like the idea of a software interface, you may want to consider this one:DYMO LabelManager 420P High Performance Portable Label Maker, Black (1768815). It will work only if the battery is charged and the unit is plugged in, which makes no sense to me. It uses a rechargeable battery and comes with an AC power brick.The basic functionality of the LabelManager LM 500TS is extensively reviewed elsewhere, so I am going to concentrate on some less-used features.The user guide that comes with the printer gives the impression that the printer cannot function when plugged into the AC adapter. Also, the installed battery need to have charge. If the installed battery is low on charge, I have to wait till it is charged first. Ignoring the battery, I plugged in the label maker and tried to make a label, but I quickly discovered that it does not operate without the proprietary battery installed even when plugged in. Overall, this is quick and easy to use.The Good:The rechargeable battery makes it extremely portable, which is a great plus. I can't really comment on battery life, as I don't need the portability for too long. The internal battery is a proprietary-looking rectangular LiPo (Lithium Polymer) unit that actually supplies the direct power to the 500TS when in use. The 500TS is nominally portable, since it can run with just the battery power. I worry about the battery depleting when sitting in the labeler for short periods of time and shortening its life. I looked in the manual long enough to find out where the battery and label cassette went, then tried it out. I also love that it has a rechargeable battery. If you happen to leave it idle or unused for a while the battery becomes depleted, which is the nuisance because the labeler is not available for use when you need it right then and there.If you want a descent Dymo desktop labeler which is an on-demand labeler and A/C or battery, go with theDymo Label Manager 450instead. This battery has to be inserted into the printer and it has to be charged for about three hours before first use. This is really dumb.3) I charged the battery for three hours before first use. The battery showed that it was half drained. I assume by this that the battery requires longer than three hours to be fully charged.4) The unit does not charge while attached to your computer via the USB cord.5) The unit times out very quickly.

Yes the battery itself has + and - markings, they are nowhere to be found on the printer itself and the terminals are deeply recessed in the unit.

That means carefully unplugging it after the battery is charged (a point in the instruction manual is not to continue charging if the battery is not charged within the specified time).

Apparently the battery drains whether the unit is on or not.
