The AmazonBasics 12-Sheet High Security Micro-Cut Shredder is just what I was looking for!First of all, this shredder is taller than other shredders I have owned standing 20.5 inches tall including the wheels (nice touch). Considering this is a micro-cut shredder, it will take you a while until you have to empty it!The manual is succinct and describes well the functions of the shredder. To test this shredder, I enlisted the help of a friend who, because of his work at a high security intelligence and reconnaissance agency in Washington, is constantly shredding everything in sight. This AmazonBasic shredder solves all that as the shredding mechanism is completely enclosed.It's fun and satisfying turning big paper into little pieces of paper! The shredder works great. The AmazonBasics 12-Sheet High Security Micro-Cut Paper/CD/Credit Card Shredder with Pullout Basket is one powerful shredder. This is no ordinary "cross-cut" shredder either. I've managed to eventually burn out every shredder I've owned. The shredder works great. Paper shredder everything I expected. I do want to be clear that I am happy with my other shredder but I'm even happier with the Amazon Basics one.Here's how it compares to my Fellowes:1. I wouldn't hesitate to use this shredder in a work environment or home office where children won't be present. The 8-sheet shredder has a dedicated slot for credit cards and another for CDs, apart from the paper feed. The 12-sheet shredder&#8217;s manual is very emphatic about not processing newsprint, windowed or padded envelopes, transparencies, cardboard, laminated documents, etc. The Amazon Basics 12-sheet shredder has exceeded my expectations for a budget line product. This is my third shredder in a year. It is very easy to move around and pull the shredder toward you, which I do a lot. It is a Micro Cut shredder and the end product was small and unlikely to be put back together easily.I really like this shredder.UPDATE: 6 months in and I am very impressed with this shredder. I just received my shredder. This shredder replaced a five year old Fellowes that provided superb service until I followed some advice and oiled the blades - it refused to work again. I think this shredder is a winner! )The AmazonBasics shredder came well packaged and was easy to unpackage. This shredder gives you no clue as to how close you are to its limit, which means that you end up shredding much less than its true capcity at each pass.Despite these two flaws, we still give it 5 stars because of the value. We were looking for a shredder that would give us a bit of security, so we purchasedAmazonBasics 8-Sheet Strip-Cut Paper/CD/Credit Card Shredder. The shredder worked well, but didn't give us the peace of mind we thought it would since one could still read things on the strips. We were searching for another shredder when the opportunity to try the AmazonBasics 12-Sheet High Security Micro-Cut Shredder came along. This shredder is EXACTLY what we were looking for!We now have peace of mind and are feeling more comfortable with the idea of recycling the micro-cut papers that come from this machine. This shredder is by far the best I've used yet.Pros:1. The AmazonBasics shredder has wheels while the fellowes does not.

I'm normally a Fellowes shredder guy.

When shredding with my cross-cut shredder, I made sure to shred sheets of paper perpendicular to the print.

I always unplug the shredder when I'm not using it, but if you like to keep yours plugged in, just keep in mind that there's no additional lock.I also want to mention that the green LED power light on the Amazon Basics is extremely bright.
