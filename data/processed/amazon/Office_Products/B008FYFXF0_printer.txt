This is hands down the easiest printer I have ever set up. This is the only negative about the printer, so now I will explain what I like about it.The set up of this printer was extremely easy on both of our laptops. I also love that it opens at the top like a commercial printer, so I can lift the lid and put whatever I want copied face down and just push print. This printer is pretty compact as well for all it's capable of. It is my favorite printer that I've ever owned and I highly recommend this to anyone if you can look past the cost of ink. I registered the printer online and it was ready to go. Buy a printer that uses more affordable inks. 6 yr old Canon All-In-One printer and we go through a black and color cartridge about every 3 months. This is a very nice compact printer, it folds up for easy storage and and does not take up much room on a counter. It is pretty simple and works like a normal printer, it offers a nice scan bed (with the top door being able to raise a little bit to support books and larger items and still have a white background). It can scan and copy from the printer (I normally use the scan function from my computer and not the one on the scanner). However, this printer excels with Photo Printing! I am happy with this printer and am enjoying it. The Canon Pixma MG4220 is an amazing printer. I highly recommend this printer as your go to for all of your home office needs. Please be aware that this printer does not have FAX capability. I ordered this printer solely to be able to print from an iPad. The printer comes with a CD for use with a PC if you're going to use it with a laptop or desktop, but I wasn't...so you will NOT need the CD if you're only planning to use an iPad. The printer comes with a &#34;starter kit&#34; of black and color print cartridges, but expect these not to last very long, so I'd recommend ordering additional cartridges when purchasing this printer.The printer instantly recognized my wireless router after I powered the printer up, and I followed simple instructions that appeared on the small screen that is a part of the printer...and that was it! It is hard to imagine that a printer with all of these capabilities was not even available a few years ago and now at this price? I am still a Canon printer and camera user and have found no reason to change. I have already recommended this printer to several friends and I know of at least one who has purchased one. This printer is great. We've had the printer for 2 weeks now and for the last several days, are unable to get it to print wirelessly, pretty disappointing.I like that the paper tray is in the front of the printer, my old printers always have it on the top which means the paper is usually curled due to the shelf above it being too low. Other than that, it's a great printer that scans, prints and makes copies that are nearly as good as the expensive laser printers at my husband's company (to be fair, they use expensive paper there, where I use cheap recycled stuff).Canon has always been a good brand for me. I heard the printer printing upstairs. This printer is somewhat slow, loud and does not have a paper storage tray - you can put in only a few sheets at a time. It's worth noting that this printer supports most smartphones via Apple Airprint and Google Cloud print. This printer offers some very attractive features at a relatively low price, but needs a bit of polish in spots.Wireless setup was quite easy, even with my more clamped-down network. I don't broadcast an SSID, but using the printer's display and keypad I was able to enter SSID and security information. The printer immediately found my network and the Mac (using Bonjour) found it. This is where a four-color printer has trouble keeping up with a higher-end photo printer. This is a very basic printer that does a good job for what it is, basic. The App is free, but it does not come with the printer. The long and short is that this is a superior printer in every way that I can ascertain. Not only did it work with each printer, I was able to set them up wirelessly. The printer does a great job of finding whatever it is that you are wanting to scan, regardless of where you place it on the glass. I am also concerned to find out how long the printer cartridges last. Other than connecting this printer and iPhone to the same Wi-Fi network, no other setup is required.
