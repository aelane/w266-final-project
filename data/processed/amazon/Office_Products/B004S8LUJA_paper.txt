If you had a paper trimmer, it would make your life so much easier.The problem with having a paper trimmer at home is that you'll need it only once in awhile. It is an office-quality paper trimmer, first of all. I currently own a paper trimmer that was handed down to me through my family so I was quick to do a side-by-side comparison once I received it.- I noticed that the new trimmer is much small in size which is good and bad. This paper cutter is sturdy and does the job. I love this paper trimmer. I've been looking for a good, sturdy paper trimmer and the Fiskars Bamboo trimmer is perfect for my needs. First, it's a very nice looking paper trimmer for home use- love the bamboo. I love that there is a "paper clap" that holds your piece(s) of paper.There is a safely mechanism of sorts to that the blade is not "free" when not in use. This is a great paper cutter. I have found this to be a very well-made paper cutter with a great design. I have had paper cutters before and this one beats them all in design. The paper guide could be a bit easier to use, but it could also be because it is new and needs a bit of break-in time.All-in-all, this is a highly recommended product.Five stars! This is a sweet paper cutter! I LOVED the automatic paper clamp and it was very helpful when cutting extra small items. I first thought it had cut crooked but it was just that the paper shifted when it dropped off the edge.

It cuts precisely, but she found it hard to get the paper into the correct position.

While it's maybe common to want to put the paper in while the blade is up, this made her very uncomfortable.

She would prefer to insert the paper for fine-tuned cutting around the edges, and THEN lift the blade up and slice.
