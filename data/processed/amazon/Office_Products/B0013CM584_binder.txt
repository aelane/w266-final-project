This is an excellent three-ring binder in a useful size. The binder has inside pockets. I am known as the binder queen around my office. What was lost is now found!This binder is (on the outside) the same-o same-o white binder with insert capability as you might have seen looking at you from any old shelf at a retailer. This is a nice little (1") binder. This binder is more sturdy and flexible. This binder is nice. I've learned that if you are going to use a binder on a daily basis (such as for school), you need a premium or heavy duty type binder. If a binder is just going to sit on a shelf holding papers, a less durable binder will do. This Wilson Jones Premium Single-Touch Locking D-Ring View Binder is a good binder that should see a student through the school year with regular usage. Place the binder upright on a table and open the binder as far as it can go, so it's actually opened backwards. I give this binder only 4 stars because of the price; I could see paying 11 dollars for a larger binder, but really, you cannot dispute the quality of this binder. Great binder. This is a great basic binder for school or special project. This is a great all-around binder! I was excited when I discovered the 'D-Ring' binder, because it holds the papers 'flat' inside, as opposed to being slightly curved with regular 'O-Ring' binders.But no matter what type of ring was in previous binders, the place where the two parts of the ring meet, would often slide apart, or bend, making the two ends not connect perfectly. Yeah, the binder may be a bit more than your typical binder but you get what you pay for. What I liked best about this binder is that it has the capability for me to slip in the topic on the front of the binder - helps me keep track of which notebook I need at the time. The binder I received was the everyday white color common to most binders. it's a typical binder. It opens and closes more easily than any other binder I've used. But as for being a $12 binder I really don't see it. The binder comes with a single touch opener, locking no-gap d-rings, and non-stick PVC free materials. This binder seems sturdy enough to hold the intended number of pages and the locking rings don't have a gap. For me, this binder works and I do like the secure locking very much. This binder is sturdy and will hold up to use and abuse. I would use this binder again. This is a nice binder and I like the D-ring over circle rings. The Wilson Jones Premium binder lives up to it's claim of a premium binder. It is a good binder for product manuals, writing projects, etc.I will only buy D-ring binders now due to their ease of use in flipping pages and extending the life of the pages.My only minor complaint is that Wilson Jones binders do exact a hefty premium; nearly $12.00 for a one inch binder is pricey but like so many things in life you get what you pay for.Good product. I love this binder! WILSON JONES PREMIUM ULTIMATE PERFORMANCE VIEW BINDER is not your ordinary binder. It's pretty hard to close the binder if the pages are not totally lined up, so it makes the hump all but impossible to achieve - SUPER! I use this Wilson Jones D-Ring Single-Touch binder to keep all my recipes in. Anyway, back to this binder - some people have mentioned that the plastic over the binder is loose or rippled and mine has this a little bit as well, but I didn't notice it and I really can't see it now that I've put a cover page into the clear plastic. This binder is a few dollars more than the D-ring binders at my local store, and while I wouldn't exactly call this binder "Premium", it's still a nice sturdy binder that looks like it will hold up. This binder has two sleeves in the front and back for loose papers, instead of the more common single sleeve. I got this binder through the Amazon Vine program, so I didn't have to pay for it. This appears to be a sturdy, high-quality binder. Inside the binder, there are four pockets: two on the inside front cover and two on the back cover. However, $12 is awfully expensive for a binder, so I would not recommend this product unless you find the single-touch features absolutely essential. This is a great binder. What else can one say about this binder other than it's a binder. What I do like about this is that the binder mechanism works well. The outside narrow binder section also has one full width functioning clear sleeve. I was disappointed that the WJ binder does NOT accommodate them. This binder has all the features you could want. Now this would not be worth mentioning in a $5.00 binder but I think you could expect better in one of this price. I am a binder connoisseur.W
