Highly recommended if you need a good cable. Slim and flexible, this cable does everything it's advertised to. So I was very happy to find that this cable charged all of these well.What I Like About This Cable:1) Four Foot length--this is just right for me as now I am using this cable with my Tablet and the cable is long enough for me to leave it plugged into the tablet so I can still use my tablet while I am reading a Kindle book (or read emails etc) in bed and it is charging at the same time.2) Tight and sturdy fit - This cable fit tightly into my devices with no wiggle room so the cable stays very nicely in place.3) Re-enforced ends / Well constructed Cable - This cable on each end, has a re-enforcement so that the cable can take movement you I take the cable out or insert the cable. This is a standard USB 2.0 to micro-USB cable that's compatible with most mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, chargers, etc.Likes:>Flamboyant color make this cable easy to find.>I use it to sync/transfer files or charge my smartphones and Kindle Fire HD 8.9 tablet.>Good quality and appears to be durable.Dislike:Too short at 4ft (1.2m)! We prefer a longer 5ft.+ (1.5m+) cable for more versatility. So I selected this cable in the hopes that it would work for my needs.First, the cable does connect my smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket) to my computer for data transfer, and does charge the phone battery. Second every other cable I have is either black or white. The MIXIT cable works for charging the phones from our computers, great for when one of the regular charging cables goes missing. However, I do use the Belkin MIXIT cable frequently to charge my phone while I'm on the computer. This cable came at a very good price and it works perfectly. Sturdy cable, seems like it will hold up over time. This USB to Micro USB cable is well made and works fine. Use this cable to connect your phone or Kindle to your computer (to transfer data) or to an automobile charger (if it has the standard USB port) or AC charging brick. The cable is a bit thinner and more flexible than the many other cables I have used, and is a lovely light blue instead of the ubiquitous black. I received the Belkin 4-Feet MIXIT Micro USB cable through Amazon Vine, and it's somewhat difficult to &#34;review&#34; a USB cable.

Although this Belkin 4-Feet Micro USB cable is one of the thinnest cables I've seen, it seems to be very well made.
