I would personally add tape to the lid if I were using these to move, but I'm currently using them for storage and am happy with how well they remain closed. They were easy to put together, I didn't have to waste tape or use any scissors as the boxes were easy to put together and amazingly solid. They are very easy to set up, they don't require tape (it's actually true), and they are very sturdy. No tape is certainly a plus at my house where it seems we are always looking for the tape and wondering who used it last.These boxes are good for more than moving; they are great for storing seasonal items. No tape is needed - that saves time packing but also makes it a lot easier to unpack. That said, I was also always looking around for where I last put my tape dispenser when I was packing. Just slice the tape and fold the box. No tape, instant setup, sturdy. No tape at all, even for the lid - it locks into place. No tape needed, they're thick and sturdy, great for storing papers or whatever else you have that needs to go in a box. No messy tape to deal with, no struggling to break a box down and build it up again. They're tape free which saves a TON of time. Not having to use tape is a bonus and there is plenty of writing area to designate the contents.When not in use, they are easy to disassemble and store flat. No tape was needed and the boxes seemed very sturdy once everything was fitted in place.We used them as suggested, for bed linens and clothes. Even though no tape was needed, I might put a piece on the top if the box was to be placed in an open trailer or truck bed, otherwise it should be fine. No tape or scissors required. They're intelligently designed, easy to assemble, no tape required, and can be used over and over. No tape is required to hold any portion of the box together. No tape: This is one of the great design. No tape needed. I put a little tape on the bottom just for extra security on the heaviest two boxes, but I doubt it was needed. You do not need tape, but tape wouldn't hurt to keep the top shut. Does it do so easily with very little set up and no tape needed? So EASY and no tape needed!- Sturdy and strong- Spacious - these boxes are bigger than I expected and would easily fit three or four dutch ovens as well as some other odds and ends.- Handles - the handles are great for carrying as opposed to some other boxes you buyCONS- Just slightly expensive; I would pay no more than $3.20 per box I hate how the tape can damage boxes for future use. Not needing tape also is a plus since when the boxes are broken down for storing, they'll still be like new. Not needing packing tape is best idea I have seen in years. No tape is required.To assemble, simply open up the four sides in one smooth and fluid movement and press down the bottom. No tape needed and handles to boot! Setting up is very simple and requires no tape. Since no tape is required, opening and closing the lid time and again was easy.I recommend the Fellowes boxes to anyone who is moving or needs sturdy boxes for long term storage. I'm bad about misplacing the tape, while I am using it, as well as getting wrinkles in it as I put it on the box. Best of all, you don't have to use any tape - the bottom of the box is two solid pieces of cardboard, and the top folds into the handles.Because of the large size of these boxes, they're recommended for packing large, lightweight items, but I used them for heavy kitchen items as well. There is no packing tape or anything required. You need no tape to close it.These are really great for moving, but you must watch the weight you put into this large size box. Cutting tape on these to break them down is just as easy on any other box, as as it is to assemble it. No tape needed! No tape, no glue, almost no work is required to fully assemble these thick durable boxes.

"Well", you might say, "Banker's Boxes don't require tape either".

Banker's Boxes don't require tape for storage, but if you have ever moved an entire apartment with Banker's Boxes, and you've been stacking them high to move them, and any wind picks up, you might see the tops fly off, and end up running down the street to get them.

(I ended up putting tape on all the tops of my Banker's Boxes so that this didn't happen, and this took even more time and materials.)
