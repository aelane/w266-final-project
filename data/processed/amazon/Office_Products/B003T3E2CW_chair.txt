This is a very comfortable chair for office use.I sat in front of my computer desk for long periods without feeling hot at the cushion or the back.The arm rests are useful when I recline or lay against the back of the chair.The height adjustment has gas strut for easy height change. This is a fantastic chair. It's like the chair was built to conform to MY body! The chair I ordered and received *does* have a metal base assembly, and the arms *are* adjustable. I think this chair is pretty great, in fact. Not only attractive, this chair is cool on my back, has enough lumbar support, is attractive and the arms are not too long or bulky. Hopefully if you buy this from Amazon, they are more careful in shipping.This chair was a delight to put together. They were very clear and the chair was easy to assemble. The chair I received does not have adjustable arms. This chair was provided by the Amazon Vine Program. I was sent this chair which is different from the one I was supposed to get, the basyx by HON HVL531 Mesh Back Work Chair, Black.This is the most comfortable office type chair I've ever sat in! )If you are looking for a comfortable, easy to put together, well made chair, this is it! With this chair, the armrests are each one piece of plastic which attaches to the side AND the back of the chair, which doesn't allow them to move. I will probably be using our "old" chair and this will be relegated to the basement, as an extra seat. *The chair is supposed to allow a bit of recline. I don't think the "cheaper" chair is a bad chair, only that it does not measure up to the model described on this page. The chair is currently being used at my teenage son's school desk. The chair I received was labeled correctly as "HON Boda HMH01" but is a cheaply-made office chair, definitely not something that retails for almost six hundred dollars. As I sit in this chair at my computer it feels very comfortable. The chair was labeled on the box HON Boda HMh01 Mesh work Chair. The chair arrived quickly, well packaged and everything was labeled. The chair arms are adjustable from inside to out and also their height which makes it nice for someone 6' 2" tall. The chair is fairly straight backed and does not move back very far when leaning back, it is quite solid. This chair is pretty decent. Overall, this is a decent chair for my music studio. But, if you are looking for a chair with multiple features, you may want to look at others.This is still a pretty good chair, though. This is a very comfortable and attractive chair. However, the Aeron chair costs more than twice as much. Therefore, this chair is probably the better choice for people who do not require the extra adjustment features. The chair in the picture, and the one described here sounds like a really good chair -- but that's not what I got. I got a cheap chair that wouldn't sell for more than $100 at an office supply store.What I got, despite the packaging, appears to be more like the HON HVL521, but even if I were to assume it was really that chair, I still couldn't give it a good review. It seems to be a better chair than the original Vine offered chair.The directions for assembly were very easy and clear to read or follow in pictures. I am 5'5" and when I set the chair so my feet rest on the floor, the arm rests will slide nicely under my computer desk, allowing me to sit closer to the screen. I am happy with this chair, it is just not the one which was ordered.I
