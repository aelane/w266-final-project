The hand tapes are wonderful for small crafts projects, wrapping gifts, or anywhere where you will be moving around.The Disc's are terrific for putting on your desk, where they are secure and you can pop off a tape one handed.There are plenty of refills included as well.All in all I HIGHLY recommend Scotch Pop-Up Tape Dispenser and Refills if you use tape for any reason at all! I never thought I'd like them, but they do allow you to keep one hand on your wrapping paper while pulling out a strip. I prefer the hand band with the tape attached to you better than the stick down dispensers since I don't necessarily want to stick the dispenser to a surface and it's quicker to pull the pre-measured piece from your hand rather than reaching for the table. I just slapped it on my hand and kept popping out tape. I just was too awkward for the hand dispensers. I like wearing it around my hand instead of my wrist, because it's a bit bulky and slides a bit, so this makes it harder for me to use easily. The hand dispenser is a must have when wrapping multipe presents, you never have to hunt around for the tape and it's the perfect length. It comes with two hand band, two table top holders and six refill packs. Again, like the hand bands, the tape never came off wrong. The hand device is nice little feature, though a little cumbersome at first. The hand dispensers prevent that from happening and give a good size strip. If you don't tape it down, it spins, and you have to hold it down with one hand (unlike the weighted desk dispensers) to avoid pulling it up. They fit nicely over the hand (or just stand on the table upright).It's a good thing everything is refillable because you get six refill pads. Not just having the hand free, but also because I would always lose the tape under the paper or behind me or wherever I put it down, now I always know where it is. I used the hand band dispenser first, and although it did work properly, I didn't like my hand covered that way while dealing with wrapping paper.The desktop dispenser was just what I needed. I have looked at these hand dispensers before, but did not know whether to make the investment. I liked having it on my hand, since I'm the type that loses the dispenser several times while wrapping. Only one hand is necessary to pull out the required length and tear it off. Something you always want to have on hand, because you will need it. The other hand dispenser was easily refilled.Using the dispensers:Both desk and hand dispensers were super easy to use. The hand straps are comfortable (around the wrist is best) and they come with elastic straps that are adjustable to fit most any hand size. On the other hand, it does save the tape from getting lost and stuck to the floor like it does tend to do with traditional dispensers.Over all I'd rate these items at four stars. The hand dispensers are empty so two of the "refills" are used to fill the hand dispensers, so in essence you get only 4 refills with this, not six.The round dispensers have a rubber suction cup on the bottom...not your normal suction cup, this is flat but it stays firmly attached to just about any surface.

On the other hand, however, the double dispenser is a little trickier to pull the tapes out of, as you'll have to reverse the direction of your pull each time --versus with a single dispenser which pushes the tape straight up, and requires you to pull straight up, instead of side to side.The wrist dispensers are nice, too.

I was forever grabbing it and then having to use the other hand to turn it around, which sort of defeated the whole one hand convenience idea.

I put it on my left hand and the tape kept catching on my wrapping paper.
