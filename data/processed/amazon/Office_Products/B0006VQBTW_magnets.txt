Plus, without magnets to attach them to the board, you can never seem to find one nearby. The magnets are neat, too: we can just stick them on the whiteboard and leave them there. The magnets are strong so they don't fall down and the eraser on each marker is very handy. The magnets hold really well,even when I open and close my fridge door, which is where I have them mounted. The magnets are able to hold the pen up, but I wouldn't ever use them to hold anything else up! I was really happy that they had magnets. The magnets did not support the weight of the marker. Unfortunately, the magnets are too weak it barely supports the markers. What I didn't care for was that the magnets had no power... the markers were constantly on the floor - and because I have two puppies, I now have purple dry erase marker that I am trying to remove from the carpeting in the front room - the marker dropped off the board while I was at work and apparently it was similar enough to a chewy stick to have been fair game.I admit to never having been a fan of the eraser on the back of the marker cap - and I'm still not. The magnets are not super strong, or my white board is very weak, and they will often slide down the board until they reach a spot with a stronger attractive force. My only quibble it the weak magnets embedded in the cap of the marker, they don't adhere strongly to metal surfaces at all. I tested the magnets on the other markers and they were just as bad. The magnets stick well to my fridge right next to my white board.

They have magnets in the cap, which makes them handy for white boards without a pen tray.

They have magnets and erasers  built into the lids, so it's easy to keep track of the lids while you're color-coding your calendar or what-have-you, and you don't need to hunt down a cloth or dirty your fingers if you make a quick mistake.

And they conveniently come equipped with magnets so they always get put back and we're not always hunting for them.It seems natural to me (and apparently to my daughters as well), based on the design and location of the magnet, that these markers should be stored point up, so that the marker is hanging from the magnet.
