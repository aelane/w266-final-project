The Avery online software was not only easy to use, but it also allowed for customized sequential numbering, inclusion of custom graphics, bar codes, QR codes, etc. Second, the online design software is cool, but not perfect. The online designer has the ability to create sequentially numbered tickets, add custom images or photos, and even has the ability to embed QR codes right on the ticket (I used it to put a link to a contest website). Avery also offers some online and downloadable programs that you can use but I haven't tried them. I decided to try the online software. The online templates help ensure the proper placement of text and images. If you use the online tool, there is only a certain set of fonts, but if you use a Word template, the sky's the limit.- Added some 'coolness' to our party without the expense of sending to a printer ($$! When used with Avery's online templates (avery.ca/templates) they are extremely easy to design and print. When I went online (and established an account), I found that most of the templates available had Valentine's Day theme backgrounds.

You design them online, then print them.

The online system shows you a preview of how your document looks and you can even print on the back of them.

The online system makes these the best choice!!
