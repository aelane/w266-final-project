The clip goes on straight down easily and slides off to the side easily if you want to switch the board to horizontal from vertical standing.Honestly, I'm very excited to have this because I have gotten very frustrated over time with leaning wipe boards up on things and trying to keep them from falling down when they aren't permanently hung on the wall. The clip is strong enough to hold a lot of pages (the notes say up to 15) , which is great for more complicated work projects.What I especially appreciate  about this product is the great improvement in posture from using it. on the clip and base are a nice touch. The top clip is super strong and none of my paper fell down. The clip is easy to attach to the board and can just as easily be removed or adjusted at any time. The clip is easy to open but holds the paper securely. Right now, I use the clip to hold my "To Do" lists on it and cross them off as I complete it. The clip is large enough to hold even small paperback books open, and should be more than a match for most documents one might care to hold.Not having any markers on hand, I have not tried the whiteboard function, but it appears to be of the same quality as a similar board one would buy by itself.While this is aimed at typists (I assume), I find that it also works well for photographic document copying. The clip can also hold a number of papers easily. You can even remove the clip and use it to hold papers separately. The clip and the base just snap onto the main board. The clip is strong and about 1 inch wide.
