This is basically the same quality you get with a photo development place. Print quality has been excellent although I first had to align the print heads (a simple process explained in the user manual). Still, it's small, easy to use and easy to install and the quality is comparable or better to others in this category. Print quality seems to be OK, but there's no way to tell the printer whether you are using plain paper of glossy paper. Excellent quality line of everyday color printer which also doubles as a photo printer - Epson has been holding up far better than HP printers of late and with the great value ink sources available here on Amazon (including inktoneram which has given us great service) the cost of printing per page is negligible.I recently compared both the 610 and the 810 printer side by side to decide which is best for my needs. They are built with quality construction, feel SOLID, and work perfectly directly out of the box. Excellent quality Epson printer, scanner, and copier that is easy to set up and simple to use. When set to photo quality the printer produces beautiful color prints in a relatively short time.

Print quality is very good.

).Scanning quality is super-sharp and definitely meets the needs of the occasional scan of a document or old photo.The size is compact, although with the paper tray the dimensions still require a decent amount of desktop real estate.Ink levels so far are holding out fine and seem to be going further (according to the sensors) than with my last HP printer.The color touch screen is a life saver.

Airprint it's not, but it was very satisfying to *finally* be able to print from *my* devices.- Photo quality: absolutely on par with the behemothEpson Artisan 730 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer, Copier, Scanner (iOS/Tablet/Smartphone/AirPrint Compatible) (C11CB18201)I also have, and I was skeptical, yes, considering that it is light and has a *very* compact footprint.
