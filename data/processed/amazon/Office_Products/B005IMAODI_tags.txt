These Avery tags took some effort on my part to use and I still have to figure out why they didn't print out quite right for me.We have Microsoft Office 2010, but this label template isn't included. I was *hoping* these tags would be my solution.When I got the box, I immediately opened them because I wasn't sure what the string was going to be like that they used - and I wasn't sure it would fit around the necks of my bottles. I love being able to print the tags on both sides. The tags are large enough to describe larger, more expensive items, the price and add a picture if needed. The tags are pre-punched and the strings attach easily. The tags are made of sturdy card stock and they have what they call quick-latch fasteners that remind me a bit of zip ties but are detatchable and professional looking.In addition to using the tags for traditional purposes I have used them to label crates we use in our animal transport efforts and with the vivid colors they accept both from printing and colored pens and pencils it is easy to read them in dim light at night when looking for a particular animal or to determine which one's require feeding. I am using these tags for household use, and not for a retail situation, so that might change the way I look at this product. I thought it would be cute to print individual tags for each kid.First of all, you go to Avery.com and find the appropriate template for your product. You can't print individual tags, but you can print half of the tags one way and half the tags another way on the same sheet. I'm using the tags to identify disaster relief equipment. The tags are big enough to put a nice graphic as well as the price of the product. With these Avery tags, you can create professionl looking hang tags for just about anything. While I do prefer to tea-stain and handstamp my own tags, I'm also impressed with Avery's new products geared toward crafters & small business owners. These tags are also great for crafts and woodworkers who sell their wares at craft shows and fairs, etc. These tags work well for a number of applications. I can now print professional looking tags with all the information I want, so that it helps my work stand out. These tags are perfect for that. Avery's printable tags are great to run and turned out fine. I like these tags, but there are a few issues that keep me from giving the tags a really high review.1. However, those tags are not printable...so... While I haven't actually started selling them myself I ordered these tags to use when I do begin selling them.Avery now has a small business division that has special labels and other products. These tags are one of those items. We used these for Christmas present tags. These printable tags are really versatile--there's no shortage of creative things to do with them. The tags would also work well for such things as price tags, as pictured on the packaging, or for mini-recipes on gift-ables like drink mixes or soup bases.They come with professional-looking attachments that are thread with plastic end caps that snap together to create a loop. Unfortunately, to have horizontal tags be the same, you'll have to print on both sides or print some upside down. And changing those tags from a sheet into actual tags is a little bit of work, but it's not too bad if you only wish to print eight at a time.My inkjet printer is a little touchy with the top horizontal perforation, which tends to throw off the printing, resulting in wasted sheets. I used this to make little tags for my tea blends. The tags are the thickness of a lighter weight cardstock. These are really great for printing your own tags for whatever you need.

We use these tags for seasonal products and they work extremely well.- They are a nice size (not huge like shipping tags)- The tags are made from a sturdy paper (but not quite as sturdy as card stock)- They take color printing very, very well- The snap-lock strings securely fasten the tags to the items- The Avery template is actually pretty simple to use (initially it takes a tiny bit of patience but once you start, you're on your way!

These tags look better in the photos than they actually are.

Overall, the tags look cheap.
