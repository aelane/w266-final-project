I use a laminator often for work and was interested to see if this would be a better fit for me. Definitely a nice solid thermal laminator. The fellowes L80-95 is a compact easy to operate laminator. This is a great little laminator. As one might guess, the AmazonBasics laminator comes in a much smaller box, and it just so happens that it is a great box for storing the unit in a closet when not in use. I cannot say the same for the Scotch laminator, which comes in a large box that I do not want cluttering up my closet.- POUCH FEED (Advantage Scotch): The Scotch laminator has a pouch feed tray on top with width adjustment guides for the pouch. The AmazonBasics laminator has no such feed tray or guides. The Scotch laminator did seem to feed a bit more easily, though I didn't have any trouble with either unit.- OTHER FEATURES/SETTINGS/INDICATORS (Toss Up): Both laminators have a release lever that can be used in the event of a jam of some sort. That means I'd probably take the AmazonBasics laminator. I was looking for a lightweight laminator for occasional use. Overall a great laminator for the price. This is the perfect laminator for thin documents like most photos and printed paper. I had owned one laminator before, and that laminator would take forever to warm up and be ready to laminate. I really wanted to give this laminator 5 stars - I really did - after I was able to laminate several documents with ease and no problems. I had been toying with getting a laminator for a while, so when I got the opportunity to try this out I jumped on it.I'll be honest when I say I had never owned a laminator before and had no idea what t o expect, but boy, did I come away impressed. This is a great little laminator. The Fellowes L80-95 is a great laminator for personal home use, which means for those who occasionally need to laminate something and don't want to have to go to the local office supply store to have it done. This compact laminator is ready to go in a mere 3 minutes and produces excellent results. This is my first laminator so I can't do a comparison. This is an awesome laminator to use for office, school or home!Set up and instructions were very quick and easy to follow. The laminator is a nice size, non bulky and sleek.Most of all it is portable and easy to carry around. I really like this laminator mostly because of the space saving design. This laminator has NONE of those problems.It heats up in a little more than 2 and a half minutes. I had one previous laminator a few years ago, and it drove me nuts with how long it took to warm up. My previous laminator heated the material a little too much so that it was kind of floppy when it came out of the machine. This is a nice little laminator with a small foot print. When I lived abroad, I had a laminator that I used for many years. This laminator achieved that same effect.The foot print on this is as small as it can be while still accommodating letter-size or A4 sheets. I've had another laminator, and it's been working for me, but I had to accept a lot of flaws, like having to rig it up to make it flat instead of slanted for some items and storing it with its odd shape not fitting well in a lot of places. It's the personal laminator I had it mind - working as well or better than the Scotch one I have but in a compact shape with a flat entry area. This personal laminator is perfect for home use as long as you're not needing heavy duty use.It takes a little while to heat up, and about a minute for a full sheet to laminate, but it does a great job.It requires 3mil, which is fine for most home projects.It has a sleek compact design which doesn't take up much space.I am very pleased with it and give it 2 thumbs up. This is probably the 5th or 6th laminator I have purchased over the years, and I must say the technology is getting better as we move forward. The Fellowes laminator is small, only does notebook size items at a 3 mil.

Okay, so I am not your average laminator reviewer.

But if you are looking for the best laminator of the bunch, Fellowes is the winner in my book.So, here's what I like about the Fellowes laminator, compared to the other 2:+ Quickest Warm-Up Time: Ready in less than 3 minutes, this laminator beats out the AmazonBasics by a bit and the Scotch TL901 by a long way.
