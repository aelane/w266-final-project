Because it's so simple to open and change the staples that wouldn't be a big deal. Inserting the staples is easy. The staples did not bind up or jam. It takes standard staples for stacks of a dozen or so sheets of paper, or you can use longer "high capacity" staples to staple through up to 65 sheets of paper. You can use the same old staples used with common everyday staplers. The staples do not close, sometimes go in crooked and at times tear the paper. Mind you, if you put the wrong staples in it, it won't staple that much, but with the right staples, which are marked on the box, it will.What other tests could I put on a stapler? It comes with 500 "regular" staples (up to 30-pages) and 500 "high-capacity" staples (up to 65-pages).Second, this stapler is NOT all-metal. then "unload" the regular staples and "load" the high-capacity staples. Loading staples is also pretty easy. I like this better than the Swingline because the staples are not as thick and conspicuous. When the staples that come with the stapler are used up, boxes of both are available from Amazon for a few dollars. The staples usually buckle and don't penetrate all the way through the paper. Curiously, the staples don't break off when stapling through 6 or more sheets. Apparently, the staples that come with the package are brittle. The staples are made in China (figures).o ErgonomicsThe stapler earns high marks on ergonomics. Let's check it out.Testing with 3/8" staples:- It staples 22-65 PAGES of 20# paper (common COPY paper weight) WITH 3/8" STAPLES. It is very EASY once you figure out how, though, I assure you.- It comes with 500 3/8" staples and 500 5/16" standard staples.SUGGESTION:-------------- I suggest testing this stapler right away on 65 pages of 20# paper stock or 60 pages of 24# stock with 3/8" staples so you can exchange it easily if you need to.OTHER HIGH CAPACITY STAPLERS:----------------------------------Swingline Optima 70 Reduced Effort Desktop Stapler, 70-Sheet Capacity, Jam Free, Silver, Retail Packaging (S7087875)-Swingline 87845 Optima Desk Stapler, 40-Sheet Capacity, Silver/Orange/Black-PaperPro 60-Sheet High-Capacity Stapler (1200) When I used the same staples on 5 sheets of paper, they worked perfectly...no breaks. Any fewer than that, and the staples won't break, but their ends will "curl around" sticking out enough to be a nuisance.The final verdict: Get this if you know you will be stapling 5-65 sheets of paper. it requires special staples. Even if I decide to start buying my own staples, what are the chances I can find them at a Walmart or Office Depot when I need them?If you are willing to take on the hassle of stocking the specific staples used by this machine, you are going to love it. If you are like me, you will probably use it till you run out of the staples than come with it, and then toss it. Standard staples can be used for lower capacity projects. The staples close very tight on your project and they certainly won't fall out. The staples are easy to insert and remove.3.

It's all simple and very straightforward, and when I loaded the staples, found a small white cardboard insert that said: "Remove insert before stapling."

Next I tried the 25/10 staples (for 65 sheets) and attacked a thicker stack of papers, and again it performed flawlessly.Now it was time to get serious.

Loading it is easy, as it should be.Not sure but it's also possible that their staples may have something with why this thing performs so well.
