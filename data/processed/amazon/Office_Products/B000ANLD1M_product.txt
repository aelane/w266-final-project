I believe that for this product, as with most things, you get what you pay for. To improve this product Avery should produce this type of label. Great product! If you buy the Avery 8127 product, you get the IDENTICAL top mailing label, with a plain paper receipt on the bottom that has no adhesive or "TrueBlock" material to block out what's underneath on the package. This is actually a 5-star product, but due to the cost I must temper it with price paid and downgrade it to 3-stars.These feed and print flawlessly, they are compatible with a myriad of label programs, they stick extremely well in my experience, and they absolutely cover anything they are applied on top of. You cannot ask for more in the product itself, I only wish they were about half the price and I'd likely not quibble at all. These are one of Avery's best product's ever!! Another great, very convenient and helpful product from Avery for the at-home business person! Excellent product for Ebayers! I highly recommend this product.

The product image shows that the Click N Ship label prints right to the edge of Avery's label.

All in all, a good product that I use for shipping on a regular basis.

That product can be tricky to use since you have to feed the sheet in exactly the correct orientation or you will end up having the label printed on the wrong part of the sheet, meaning the entire sheet is ruined.
