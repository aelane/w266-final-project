I do like, though, how it's got one large pocket, and one that is sewn in the middle to really give you 3 pockets overall. The right pocket fits an iPhone 5 in an Otterbox case. This pocket fits perfectly on the door. Now, that said, if you're expecting this to be a larger pocket that can handle sheets of paper or folders, there's disappointment ahead.The second and more serious problem I encountered is that one of the magnets came off during shipping and was loose in the packaging when it arrived. This is a great neoprene pocket with a magnetic back. What you end up with is a pocket on the right that is 4&#34; wide but the opening at the top is 3.25&#34; wide. The pocket is not large enough for scientific calculators like the TI 83/84s.The magnets are quite strong and should hold up to daily use (and slamming) without problem. The pocket doesn't slide down a metal surface even when you fill them with objects (which could weigh it down) or when you move a door that it's attached to. This magnetic pocket solved the problem! I really love this pocket! The right pocket is going to be for their calculators. Your pocket, your purse, your backpack.

One is a wide pocket.

The other pocket is divided in two sub-pockets, for small things like pens and fine-tip dry erase markers.

The pocket can even accommodate thick markers, highlighters, for example.
