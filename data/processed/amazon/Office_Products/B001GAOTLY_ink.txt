Unfortunately, the ink doesn't last very long, especially if you write a lot. These are true liquid ink pens (not ballpoint) that flows from the barrel smoothly. The ink is heat-sensitive so it it removed via heat, and not the actual material of the eraser. Not only do they yield beautiful, dark and steady ink flow, they are actually and truly erasable leaving no sign of previous markings on the paper. 1) The ink is erasable due to friction, hence the name "Frixion." This means whenever the ink is exposed to any rubbing or abraision, it disappears without a trace. 2) The ink runs out fast and goes illegibly light when there is still visible amounts of ink in the barrel. It's so great to have ink and not have to be super careful with mistakes. They use gel ink, so the issue with not writing well would be solved. First, they write no different than any gel ink pen. Problem solved with these erasable ink pens. The ink is a bit slow to dry and can smudge. However, the ink erases far better than I expected.
