I like chalk boards. Also, this does not come with any chalk. I also had to buy some chalk pens. Yes, I will probably also buy some real chalk, and if I do that, I'm going to need a chalk holder, because I don't like the way the chalk dust feels on my hands.I think that this chalkboard is pretty sturdy, yet lightweight. This is a very light-weight chalk board. It works great for writing with chalk, but a traditional chalkboard eraser doesn't work as well on the textured surface. The chalk Sticks I am using are Alphacolor Chalk Sticks , got them here on Amazon 12 sticks in 8 fabulous colorsThe board is pretty good quality, nothing as good as the wonderful old slate boards were of course. So far we need to go get chalk and will likely use a sponge to clean it once we do write on it. Add chalk! Hmmm...yes, chalk works really well on it. (Does not come with chalk or eraser.) Hold the chalk sideways and cover the whole board with chalk. This is a nice-looking chalk board. Using a chalk eraser doesn't really work, but it's such a small board that it makes more sense to use a paper towel anyhow. It doesn't come with chalk, which was a disappointment. I realize that chalk is cheap, but we have none around the house and wanted to use it right away, so it would have been nice had they added one piece in the packaging. My chalk flowed smoothly across the surface. Well, the chalk doesn't show up very well on plastic, nor does it easily erase. But for actual, traditional chalk it just doesn't cut it. True chalk doesn't adhere to this as well as it would to a real chalk board, and the slight texturing on the board makes it hard to create nice clean lines. However, it writes just as fine with any chalk that you purchase.The chalkboard comes with screws and hooks to help you in hanging it up. It did not come with chalk, but my grandchild had side-walk side and it worked just as good. I got some colored chalk for the board and have had no problems with it...at all. The colored chalk looks gorgeous on the board and it cleans up easier than a chalkboard (where color residue would linger forever). I haven't had any chalk ghosting happen, it wipes clean quickly and easily.The outer frame is as dark as the picture, giving it a weathered classic look. There's nowhere to keep chalk near my front door, so I tied a string to the nail I used to hang the board and attach my chalk there, so that even in a hurry, I can jot a quick, &#34;I LOVE YOU!&#34; before we all head out the door. It erases well and the chalk I bought shows up well on it. It doesn't come with chalk or any kind of eraser, but those are not hard to come by. This is not a two sided chalk board and the writing surface is small, 6 incles by 8 1/2 inches, but I find it's plenty of space to leave messages. If you balance the chalk on the frame, you'll soon be picking it up off the floor.Other than that, it's stylish and convenient! This some what small chalk board is no exception, and the kids have the hardest time sharing it.I like the picture on the package where it shows it on a wall in the kitchen. The chalk worked well on the board. Too bad there isn't a chalk holder.If you found this review helpful please give it a thumbs up below! And the chalk dust goes everywhere, including the attaching itself to the wooden part of the frame, making everything a dusty mess.

With chalk, you're never standing in front of a group of people, grab the only marker in a particular color, and find out it's useless.

I use the chalk markers instead of regular dry chalk.

The chalk is darker compared to the on have that writes a little rough since board is not as smooth.
