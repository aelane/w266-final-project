There were three colors in the package to correspond with my three species--dog, cat, bird. I really liked that there were 3 different colors in 3 attached pads. The colors made it easy to find the right files and since they were removable we could change colors as the file progressed to being completed. The two colors help code them. I also with the colors were a bit brighter to punch up the contrast between the tab colors (pastel blue, yellow, and green are surprisingly similar colors). The colors are nice, but the 3" tab is a bit too long for anything I would want to use these for. The colors are great, and the ink glides on nicely. NoteTabs come in assorted colors, and I color-code lots of things, from recipes to finances to the Bible. The colors are not garish, and they have enough room on them for a substantial note. The colors are subtle yellow and blue, easy on the eyes and non-distracting. With the colors available, you can color code the note tabs for use when researching term papers or journal articles - perfect for students.The best thing about these is that I got them before my wife did - she's just a bit jealous.

Using different colors helps with organization.

I only wish they came in more colors and in larger packages.

I use the different colors to differentiate types of recipes.
