I needed a box that would hold some heavier items, and I got them. Bigger than the standard box of this class, these 12 x 25 boxes give plenty of room for extra files, paperwork, magazines, etc. My new go-to box. If you are looking for a heavy-duty box that is even stronger for stacking (although not as large), check out theBankers Box R-Kive Heavy-Duty Storage Boxes, Letter/Legal, White/Black, 4-Pack (0072414). So it's all together in one handy box but organized into sections inside.I've also used one to sort out anything important to our household, like warranties, product manuals, receipts for purchases of big items, car repair & maintenance records, birth certificate and passport copies, etc.If I had a hundred of these, I could find a 101 different uses for them. A solidly constructed box that is stackable as long as it is completely filled and easy to carry. Since the box quite long in relation to its width, the middle part of the top opening is a point of structural weakness, this is compounded by the fact that the two folding lids do not completely cross over the top of the box and have only a 1&#34; overlap. The box is quite big, so it can store a lot of documents.

The box almost folds itself into place.

12 X 25&#34; and solid.NOT your typical 11 X 17&#34; box, the Fellowes boxes are heavy, have reinforced holes where they are tied shut, a plastic pull out handle on one end and the usual holes on both sides for lifting.

Over $9 a box in a pack of four?
