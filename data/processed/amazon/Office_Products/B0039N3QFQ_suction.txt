The suction cup worked exactly as described in the instructions it was easy to place and easy to undo- but not so easy that it come unstuck by itself. The suction cup base is a great idea so furniture won't be marred, but the cup needs to be stronger. I haven't seen a rubber suction grip like that before. I have to say the suction base works well and does not leave any marks on my granite countertop. The suction cup bottom of the dispenser works well to hold it to the desktop and then you just slide it off the edge of the desk if you want to relocate it. The suction base (NOT your regular suction cup thing) holds the dispenser tightly to my desk while I pull up one perfectly-sized piece of tape at a time. Unlike a typical deep suction cup, which can be hard to remove, this large shallow cup comes off easily.Next best feature: the tape strips that are dispensed are perfect for gift wrapping. Surprisingly, the suction cup beneath the dispenser worked great for all surfaces. The suction cup keeps it in place very nicely, and each piece of tape is just about the right size for most projects. The suction cup base gives one just enough resistance to be able to pull a piece of tape off one-handed and to still be easily removed from your work surface. It has a VERY light suction grip to your desk, enough to keep it down but still allow you to move it around easily.The pre-sized pieces of tape are enough for most needs, and might help to curb tape-wasters (kids!). The large suction cup on the bottom of the container sticks it down and gives resistance when you pull the tape up. The suction cup that holds the dispenser to the desk surface is great. When I first looked at and felt the suction cup material, I was skeptical that it would be strong enough to really hold on to my desk top. It is not a suction cup, though it does create a vacuum - sort of. I would like it a little more if the suction cup at the bottom of the dispenser actually held the darn thing in place on my desk, however that apparently is not the case.Anyway, getting the tape in pre-cut three quarter inch strips is excellent! What I'm surprised at is that the suction cup actually worked pretty well on my desk! It's not exactly suction, but it stays put until you want to remove it by sliding it off to the edge.I'll still use my regular Scotch tape dispenser for most uses, but this one is perfect for those times--like wrapping gifts--when you need one hand to hold the package and another hand to pick up and apply that piece of tape.Oh, and it dispenses convenient-sized strips of tape reliably and easily every time.It's another great product from 3M--and it works! It is not a normal suction that stays put this one is more a friction type and while it does stay on the table when you pull straight up on the tape, it still slides around freely, weird. The suction cup holder on the bottom works very well in keeping the dispenser stationary.The only negative at this point would be that this is such a new gizmo, you will be forced to purchase only Scotch brand refills of tape, which may be a little on the expensive side. The suction of the dispenser's base is not equally effective on all surfaces (in my case, I prefer to hold the dispenser in my hand while working on music score projects requiring me to line up sheets of paper in a hallway).I should add that the suction cup on the bottom of the Scotch dispenser is "deceptive"--at first appearing to have little to no effect. The suction cup on the bottom is really neat. It is not a suction cup, but a thin circular piece of rubber (using suction/vacuum priciple) holds on to the surface. The suction cup doesn't actually stick to surfaces, the amount of tape included is miniscule, and it more often than not takes both hands to even dispense a single piece of tape without wasting several more pieces. The suction cup also works great; it slides around the desk easier than a computer mouse yet holds fast when you are pulling up on in.I'll probably still keep my old tape dispenser for those odd times when I need a foot-long piece of tape, but for everything else this pop-up dispenser is a winner.

It has a very grippy suction cup on the bottom that works well on any smooth surface.

The suction cup does prevent the holder from lifting up as you pull out a tape.

With the innovative suction cup on the base (which provides suction, yet can be easily pushed around a desk) the product does not disappoint mechanically in any way.HOWEVER, for the price you pay, I would have expected to get more tape.
