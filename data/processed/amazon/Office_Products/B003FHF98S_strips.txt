They each hold 2 refill strips of tape. I also found that the individual strips of tape helped limit my kids when they were trying to put up pictures in their room - they couldn't go crazy and use up half a roll on one page.However, it seems to me that this product has somewhat limited applications as I don't know how often I would use this beyond very specific things as I am not a "one-size-fits-all person" and usually use very little tape - thus the pre-cut strips are actually more than I would normally use. It holds 150 strips of tape at a time. I do like the pre-cut strips. The pre-cut strips of tape are a fabulous idea, very easy to use and I wonder why it took so long to think up this idea. and I hate cutting several strips of tape and placing them on the edges of tables where they get crinkled and wrinkled. +++++++++++++ The Pros +++++++++++++[+] 2" precut strips. These strips are the same familiar tape I've used for years, only in small sections that are perfect to apply to a seam. The short strips were just right for wrapping small gifts (the size of a hardback book or smaller). I used eight strips each on most of the packages (six on the smaller ones, so I probably used about 60 and the hand dispenser was not emptied, so it was also more economical than I thought it might be. These strips are 2 inches long. The pre-cut strips are of a useful size for most wrapping and craft projects.But it is the dispenser that fits across the hand or on the wrist (depending on your preference) that I, surprisingly, found to be the most useful. The last 5-10 strips on the refill come out a little slower and it's hard to know exactly when you've used the last one, but I've only wasted 2-3 tabs each time I've refilled them.This has made my Christmas gift-wrapping easier and allows my daughter to help by pulling out the tape strips and handing them to me! These pre-cut strips of tape are perfect for accommodating that paranoia.
