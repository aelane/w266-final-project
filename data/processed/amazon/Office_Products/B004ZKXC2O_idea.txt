These are very handy and a neat idea to help categorize. Great idea, I'll be buying these from now on. A great idea. I like the general idea of this pad. This is a great idea for people who use sticky notes a lot and like to have a variety of colors and sizes. Smart idea to have various sizes on one pad. These are such a great idea! The idea behind these Sticky Notes is to give you a variety of color and size and you just pull out the color/size that you want.For me these Avery Sticky Notes just don't work. The idea behind them is genius. The idea of being able to choose your own size and what ever color and have them all in one pad works far better than you would expect. Great idea! A simple idea that I've never seen elsewhere.

What a fantastic idea!

I like this, I thought it was a good idea and when I run out I will buy more (and try to hide them where I won't have to share them).

Whoever thought up this idea is a genius!
