This 2" folder has a strip of cardboard that fits into the bottom of the folder. This keeps the folder open when you remove the papers (assuming that the file drawer is not jammed full). Sometimes I don't bother to relabel if it's a folder I frequently use as I know where it is located. I was using those folder before that you had to attach the plastic bits which was never really fun and it was time consuming and painstakingly boring task. If you are a heavy folder recycler, and you are constantly adding to many files, as I am, these aren't the best option. I don't know about you, but I don't tend to reuse the folder anyway--they get quite beat up after awhile. When a folder catches the attention of someone eighty years old, then you know it has to be nice! If you should need to reuse the folder, you could just use a mailing label to cover up the tab and mark with the new label.These have an extra 2-inch wide piece of cardboard that you can place in the bottom of the folder and lock in place with some tabs. These are integral to the folder itself. I like it because I tend to change folder names from time to time, and this lets me apply a medium size Post-It Note to use as identification.Support strips at the top, the parts that actually do the hanging, are superior to Pendaflex. Making a folder with built-in heavy-duty tabs for quick and easy labeling without needing plastic tabs is a revolutionary idea, but it is simple. The folder was heavy duty and will last longer than the conventional folders that I have been using. Then again, if you're going to use the folder for a long time (and they are very durable), then you don't need to use them over. While the folder board seems no thicker than the board used in my other hanging files, the way the tops are folded and glued over the metal hanging rods appears to be very secure. A new hanging folder from Smead. The folder itself is nothing exceptional - just like any other hanging folders. Each folder has a large tab to write on so you can know what is inside the folder.I received the light green color that is just lovely.
