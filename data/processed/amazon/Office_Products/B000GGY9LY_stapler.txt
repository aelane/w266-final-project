I'm very happy with this stapler! I've been using this stapler every day for almost two years and haven't had one single jam. It seems like every stapler has a sweet spot where you have to hit it "just right" or else it jams and/or bends the staple.Not with this one.PaperPro staplers have a firing mechanism like a gun. Still a great stapler though. I used to use my trusty Swingline stapler (just like in Office Space) but found that if I stapled more than 7-8 sheets of paper together, the stapler would jam or not push the staple all the way through. I know you shouldn't get this excited about a stapler but the ease with which it sends staples through the paper is quite amazing. If you are looking for a new stapler, this one is well worth the price. This stapler could lead anyone to similar levels of obsession. It's the first stapler I've ever had that both feels good in my hand and also sits properly on the desk; usually it's one or the other.I've never seen this stapler "bind up" (as Milton would put it). The first PaperPro stapler I bought for her was a godsend, and from then on I've never looked back and have always been buying from this brand. This particular stapler can staple up to 25 sheets.It uses regular staples. I bought this to replace the cheap stapler I was issued for my high school classroom. I love this stapler. This stapler lives up to its claims. Since this stapler is designed to work with minimal force, and it penetrates pages quickly, it does not have the problem of making it through some pages and not others. I just purchased and received my second PaperPro Prodigy stapler in metallic blue - not because the first one is no longer functional, but simply because I needed another stapler.The current 25% off coupon which is available here on Amazon was an unexpected bonus, but I would have purchased this stapler even without a discount.The first of these staplers in black that I bought at a local Office Depot about 5 years ago is still going strong and I for the life of me cannot recall it ever having jammed once during regular daily use.The same cannot be said for the other big stapler brand, Swingline. This is the only stapler brand that I will be purchasing in the future.

If a simple stapler can be amazing this one is.

I want to thank Swingline because I never would have known that there was a stapler that could staple 28 pages with two fingers pushing on top!

I even wondered if it was battery operated.Best stapler I've EVER used.Note: Because you load this while it's on its back, the staples go in "upside-down" or at least seemingly so from or "ordinary" or "normal" staplers.ew
