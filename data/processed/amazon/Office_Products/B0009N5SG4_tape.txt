This Duck Brand 3" tape gun works fine and should last a long time. The tape is paper, but due to being self-stick tape, the surface is shinny to the tape does not stock to itself and thus cannot be easily written on, which was the purpose for my buying the paper tape. This tape is thin, and you can use it effectively if you're careful, but you definitely have to get the 'feel' of it; imagine driving a new car with sensitive brakes. This tape is a good thickness and easy to use. I use the 2" strapping tape for large boxes of rocks (I'm a geologist). This is good tape. The tape is a little on the thin side but at this price you and just use a little more. Nothing really novel about this as it's a tape dispenser.

We have tried a few different tape guns and this is the best yet.

3" tape is my preferred size for shipping as it doesn't usually take "two passes" of tape to feel a box is securely closed.

Packaging/shipping tape is for sealing boxes, not for preventing them from bursting open.TIPS ON USE>  The tape sticks well to most cardboard (of shipping boxes), but sticks much better to itself.
