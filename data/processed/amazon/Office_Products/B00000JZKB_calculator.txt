I got this calculator at request from my Corporate Finance professor.Its the student version and pretty easy to use -- key thing being that you regularly clear your work from memory in between TVM problems.Once you get the hang of it, its very fast to calculate PV, NPV, FV, Cost of Capital, etc.Its not as solidly made as the TI-85's I had in Calc as an undergrad, but its small, lightweight and easy to use --- worth the 28$ and actually a bit quicker to solve finance problems than MS Excel(Note:  for real world NPVs, I do use Excel since thats more repetitive work and involves alot of different scenario modeling that would be less efficient on a manual calculator.) I had gotten my first TI calculator in 6th or 7th grade. I bought this calculator for a finance class so that I could enter the calculations I need as they are taught in class rather than figuring it out on my graphing calculator. This is a good calculator as would be expected from Texas Instruments, who have been in the calculator business for decades. A calculator should do the functions that it is supposed to do, which this calculator does. I have only used this calculator for a total of maybe 15 - 20 hours, and the keys may work better over time, but I have not seen any change during the timeframe noted.Update 6/16/11 - I'm hoping that I ended up with a lemon, and that this is not an indicator of TI's quality standards. I'd been avoiding getting a financial calculator for several years because I thought that it would be too complicated to learn how to use, and that using Excel or just calculating what I needed using algebra would be simpler and less probe to errors. This calculator was required, by name, for a class I am taking, and I begrudgingly bought it.

This is a good calculator for those who are taking business classes.

I bought the calculator for Accounting classes, and now it is just laying there not used.
