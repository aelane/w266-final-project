You can even write a note on the clear part that is adhering to the page.Their durability makes up for the fact that they cost more than flimsier sticky notes. Think post-it note on steroids and you're heading in the right direction. I can also write a short note with additional information. I already reviewed these note tabs (another size) here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1MS5RWYUF3XTI/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm...One thing I forgot to do was test smudging. Instead of having note pads and using big sheets of paper for small notes, these are much better! You can put a note tab on a folder or paper and then move it to another folder or paper or just change what's on the tab. These sturdy note tabs can be put to varied uses, and definitely help keep my paperwork better organized. We are sticky note junkies in our house and we are the type who love to go to the office supply store just for fun. Even in (loose-leaf note)books where you CAB insert afull-page cardboard or plastic separator -- why do it? I can make note of key passages with both color and small comments that will help me be most efficient in my time. It is like a post-it note but stiffer, made of matte finish plastic. I've used note tabs for years and years, and I can honestly say that these are among the best I've ever used.What makes these tabs so different?
