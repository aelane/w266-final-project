This box is certainly heavy with about 1 inch walls all around. The entire box seems to be made out of plastic, or at least the exterior seems so. I have been looking for a box to store medical and personal files that is fireproof. This box is big enough to do that, but not too heavy for me to easily handle myself. This box is exactly what the description proclaims it to be: a large, solid, very rugged and safe box to store your important documents and other ephemera in. The box does not lock or have any security features at all, so if you're looking for a security safe, this isn't it. All that is included is the box. The box is heavy, sturdy, latches securely and comes with an adhesive label on which you can write the box's contents. The box can accommodate legal or letter size files. The box is perfect for my need which is storing old tax returns in a slightly moist basement to free up storage space in my office file cabinet. I would recommend the "Sentry Storage box" only as a very heavy file box.
