The stylus works fine on my tablet (Galaxy Note 8), maybe the surface is just a bit larger than I would choose for a stylus. The Zebra Stylus Pen has a stylus that's a bit more stiff, and works great every time. But when I used this stylus, my typing accuracy was MUCH better than when using only my fingertips.So, in summary, a very nice pen reasonably priced. Thought I'd try this stylus to see if that would help. The stylus also works fine with a touch-screen device (I tried it on a phone).So yes, if you want a pen/stylus combo, this is a good one to consider.However, I find the combination a bit odd. As for the stylus...I have a few devices that have touchscreens, and I generally just use my finger, and that works fine. The stylus works well with both my iPhone and iPad even though I use screen protectors on both. I have yet to find a fine-tipped stylus, and this Zebra is no exception. Because of this, I don't use a stylus often, but this pen comes in handy when I do. Using a stylus is a little different than your fingers, but the more you use, the faster and easier it is. Second, the stylus is perfect for phones or tablets. The stylus is 5 stars but the ink flow experience on the pen I have is 2 stars which is why I gave this a 3-star rating. It is durable.As for the stylus, I have used it in drawing and notetaking apps. The stylus works fine, for both clicking and swiping, except that 2-finger gestures are impossible. The stylus works on my iPad and phone. It is a fair stylus, works really well with Word with Friends on the 'ole smart-phone. But you can get three great stylus for under 5 bucks and a solid pen for under four. I think it works surprisingly well for such a cheap stylus on the iPad, and it works just fine as a ballpoint pen, too. The stylus is on the opposite end of the pen as the point; you click down on the clip to extend or retract the pen point. This stylus has a rubber tip on the back end and a regular ball point on the business end, where you would expect it. This stylus is pretty nice, and the price is really cheap at $7. I've only used one other stylus, the AmazonBasics model which retails for around $7. However, the stylus on this pen seemed to be about as useful and I didn't have any problems with getting it to be recognized by an iPad 4 or a Google Nexus 7 (2013 model).As with all combination items, it's not going to be the best at either use, but it's a suitable compromise that provides two uses in a single item so that two do not have to be taken along. If you really like to use a stylus, this might be just what you were looking for! The stylus works ok. The stylus is squishy rather than hard and is basically a plastic dome. The Zebra stylus pen is a great pen for those who want a pen that can also be used as a stylus with a smartphone, iPod, or tablet computer. I don't use a stylus normally, being a fingertip kind of guy with my iPad, but I tried this with much hope that it would change my mind. As a stylus, it's okay. The ZEBRA STYLUS PEN WITH SUPER SMOOTH ADVANCED INK is a medium-style stylus at one end with a retractable medium ball point pen on the other.
