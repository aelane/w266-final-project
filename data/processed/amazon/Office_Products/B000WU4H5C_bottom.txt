It is firm yet supple and the bottom has nonslip surface. The bottom of the rest is made from a smooth plastic which allows it to grip my laminate desk tightly. The bottom does tend to collect dust though, and needs to be wiped with a damp paper towel on occasion.The rest is a about two inches longer than my iMac's full size aluminum keyboard. The bottom of the wrist rest is built in such a way that it provides great traction and will not slide around. However, if the bottom edge of your keyboard is curved - like myLogitech Cordless Desktop LX310 Laser- it won't comform to the bottom of the keyboard. The bottom is made from a tacky material to prevent sliding around. The bottom is non-skid, so it doesn't slide around, which is also nice. The bottom of the 3M is a skid-proof surface which adheres to what you place it on without actually *sticking* to it. The bottom has got a high friction backing which keeps the pad from moving. Also it doesn't slip around due to the bottom. The bottom of the pad is rubber which keeps it from sliding around.

The bottom of the rest has a somewhat rubbery consistency, which helps keep it parked on a smooth desktop.The only drawback to the leatherette surface is that it gets a little sticky if the room gets warm enough to cause you to perspire a bit.

I was afraid that once removed, the bottom would be sticky.

If the bottom edge of your keyboard is straight, this is the best wrist rest I have ever tried.
