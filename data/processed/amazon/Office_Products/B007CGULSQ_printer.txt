The printer works great. The Canon Pixma MX892 is a wireless printer, which I liked. can't ask for much more from a all in one printer. It's not perfect, but it runs the printer features. I really love this printer. I find this printer to be extremely user friendly. The printer is very reasonably priced and provides excellent prints. This is our 4th Canon printer, not because anything is wrong with the other three but because we love them so much and ended up replacing both of our non-wireless with wireless. (This isn't as fast as my OLD printer either) I am quite happy with this printer. The printer is easy to use, has great flexibility and can be used as not only as a printer but also as a scanner, copier, and fax machine. I "highly recommend" this printer. I love this printer so far. With this printer, the cartridges are very inexpensive, and so far seem to last just as long for the amount I print on it. )Its difficult to fit this printer on a normal computer desk because of its size!Sometimes my half sheets of paper get stuck in the bottom of the printer. Once this printer warms up, it prints fairly quickly for a printer in this price range. When scanning or copying with the ADF, you cannot use the printer panel controls for the duplex function. I chose this printer because I was always very satisfied with Canon and more than likely will be in the future.Although my last printer Canon IP3600 bought in Germany had compatible problems with the ink cartridges that I bought here, i am still very pleased with my Canon products.I would always and still do today recommend Canon as the best solution for printing because I am very satisfied with the results and quality. It's a good printer, but does guzzle ink, so be aware & have plenty of backup supplies (see my post on the 2 vendors to buy ink from as they are great). The printer cartridges are expensive, so I bought these generics.20 Pack Compatible Canon CLI-226 , PGI-225 4 Small Black, 4 Cyan, 4 ...Printer works great. This printer has seperate color cartridges which should help reduce the cost of the ink but I have not bought any yet so unsure. The printer looks great and looks to be built very sturdy compared to my previous canon. So once again, I will troubleshoot and probably end up rebooting printer and laptop. It might be a good printer for you if connected with USB but you won't like the small ink tank size. This is a good and so far reliable printer. I loved my old printer and actually love this new printer as well due to its features. The printer works OK on wired network or USB connections. I bought this printer to replce an HP color laser printer. Apparently DHCP is not working on the printer. Now the printer is always showing offline even though it is powered on and the display panel is lit. This printer is JUNK!
