Another product for the "to buy list." This product revision strikes me as change for the sake of change, but without any big advantage over the traditional dispensers. A good product! I gave this product 3 stars because the fancy dispenser is not, in my opinion, worth the extra money. This product fits right into my life. Great product! In all, an excellent product from 3M. I noticed this product at Wal-Mart, & it is roughly $1.00 more than Scotch tape in a regular dispenser. This product is a fine example of how far companies are willing to go to deliver a product made of just the minimal amount of material to prevent it from falling apart in thin air.

I would definitely recommend this product because it will be so easy to refill, which means less waste and that's always a good thing!

As long as this product stays close to price to the "original" I would be more apt to buy this one.

The product description says this is for use in offices and home offices..
