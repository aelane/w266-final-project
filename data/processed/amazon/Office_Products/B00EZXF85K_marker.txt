A standard Expo Fine Tip marker can just barely fit in (I don't know if it has long term side-effects). The marker writes decently and erases well. The included marker has an attached eraser, which cleans the board off perfectly. A ReWritables black marker with an eraser is included fastened via a plastic clamp at the top of the board. We put the marker in a magnetic pen holder that we also have on our refrigerator. )The marker included with my board, however, was dried out. Although I'm not too happy about the dry-erase marker that came with it I think it's a decent board and I use it everyday when I step out of my office. The marker is definitely not of high quality, but could be replaced by one that is. Even after wetting the marker tip, it seemed to drag and skip a bit. The marker was dried out and the board is just mediocre.

Yeah, the included marker is kind of garbage, but I have other dry erase markers.

The marker is very short if you try to write without attaching the eraser part.

The included marker fits okay.
