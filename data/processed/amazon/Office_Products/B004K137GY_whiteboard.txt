I got this to replace our aging whiteboard on our refrigerator. This is a nice little whiteboard, with good set of starter accessories (pen, pair of magnets, and several mounting options). This is a very basic whiteboard for taking notes. This is a very very basic magnetic whiteboard. This magnetic whiteboard is great for various uses, but it may not hold on your fridge. If you are looking for a sturdy whiteboard, this one might not be a good option for you. I used this whiteboard as a giant flashcard to go over math with my second grader. We &#8220;handle&#8221; our whiteboard often, so placing it on the fridge is not important to us. If you are one who needs a &#8220;handy&#8221; whiteboard, this one is great! While this magnetic whiteboard works perfectly fine as far as the writing and erasing part, the magnetic mounting part leaves a bit to be desired. I've been meaning to get a whiteboard and when this one was offered, I snapped it right up.
