I've been using double-sided tape, but the cards sometimes fall down in high humidity. She switched to tape. But tape either doesn't stay up or stays up so well it peels the paint off when removed. This tape would be perfect for that, because they could just use these same six strips of tape day after day after day. When the tape gets grubby after repeated use, you can just wash it off and then it's sticky again after it dries. Otherwise, good old tape might be a better option... I was using regular tape to post things but the tape leaves a reside at times plus I end up having to scrape the tape that tears as I remove the picture to put up a new one. No tape tearing , no sticky residue to remove. The tape can be cut with scissors into smaller strips. If the tape gets dirty, washing it in soapy water will help it to regain its stickiness. I went to un-peal the tape to reposition the phantom and...to my surprise it came of clean!
