One of the best printers I have ever had. I have set up many printers in my day, both wired and wireless, and this was by far the best experience in setup.The first thing I loved was that I didn't need to plug the printer into the computer to set it up (most wireless printers out there have to start connected, be set up, then go wireless). It is not sleek and elegant looking like some printers are now, but it looks utilitarian and like something made 15 years ago. I have owned many Epson printers. Now I find their printers are little more than frustrating pricy paper weights. I have owned several printers-- just about every major brand. The 610 and the 810 printers are nearly identical, the primary difference being the 810 is slightly taller since it also includes a fold out auto document feeder which handles up to 30 pages, double sided, for scanning and copying and FAXING, which the 610 is not capable of faxing though it works great with services such as eFax which I personally prefer to use, anyway!Both printers have a rear accessible paper feed for thicker card stock, premium paper or photo paper. Both printers feature a built in paper tray to handle 100 page capacity. Both printers feature a lower slide out tray to hold CDs and DVDs to print DIRECTLY on to the disk without it spinning or becoming misaligned. Both the 610 and the 810 printers use the Epson 273 ink cartridges - 5 in the set for cyan, magenta, yellow, black and photo black (this is this important for printing photos! )I am very impressed with both printers. I've bought numerous printers in my life and this is the first time I've ever encounter a missing piece. That's what I love about my previous Epson printers also. Both of these printers produce excellent quality prints on standard paper and photo paper. I don't like that and it cost both of these printers one star.They're nice printers. My last two printers have been Epson and the button layout & LCD screen are the same on this one. Since I have 2 printers, I decided to put this one in my kids' room so they can print their school reports. These printers are AWFUL.Listen here, you're not saving any money buying a cheap printer BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE REPLACING IT EVERY YEAR. It is good but not superior than other printers I have.The paper cassettes are flimsy and easily push too far into the printer.

Once I did that, the printers showed up in the Printers & Faxes folder of my ancient Windows XP system, from which I could designate the default choice for my applications.

Both printers took a minute or so to start printing, but they eventually kicked out results.

As with most printers these days, there seems to be more &#34;fluffware&#34; along for the ride that I would like, but I'm old-school and like to just install the bare minimum drivers.
