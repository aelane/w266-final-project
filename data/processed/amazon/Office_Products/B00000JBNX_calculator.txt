This is a good calculator, does what it is supposed to, great color, easy to take on the road when I travel. 3rd calculator I've ordered here. This calculator does the job for what I need. This is the required calculator for the 6th grade here in Ohio, but I originally purchased mine for an advanced chemistry class for a top 10 university course 18 years ago. This TI scientific calculator was easy to use instantly. This is a very nice calculator for high school students in higher math - algebra, trig, pre-calculus. I love this calculator - very useful. I used this calculator throughout college and it served me well. For all your non-graphing calculator needs this is the calculator for you. I looked everywhere for a calculator that would help with my son's Geometry. I purchased this calculator after the first one I bought for her, this one:Texas Instruments Inc. TI-84 Plus Silver Edition Blue Graphing Calculator (Packaging may vary)was rejected by my sister's math teacher as being too complex for a basic algebra class. I remember this calculator from several years ago during various math classes.

This is my third Texas Instruments calculator.

I bought this one because I needed a no-frills scientific calculator for my Diff Eq class.

I plan on getting another calculator like these before my statistics class next semester.
