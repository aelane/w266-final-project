That's a 4" ticket with a 1 " stub attached.These line up nicely in a printer. I ended up with a very nice "ticket" with a stub that can be used for a drawing at the reunion. Each ticket and stub will have an imprinted number that match. Each ticket we sell is also good for a door prize and this is a great way to publicize the event as well as have a ticket. I think it's natural to not want to waste a ticket, so it does help drive attendance.Well worth doing! This is just the perfect little ticket sheets. They were easy to separate without tearing off the ticket stub. These ticket sets come 20 sheets to a package, with 10 tickets you can tear off on each sheet (for 200 total tickets).To print them off, load them into your printer tray just like paper (once you have the formatting set for tickets - experiment on regular paper first! ).Then fold each ticket along the crease lines, which serves to also pull them apart. The ticket stock is great and seem very professional. Also, the ticket stubs come apart wonderfully after printing. Where Avery seriously fails is in the ticket template design.I had wanted to try this on both an inkjet and laser printer since it is rated for both. This is nice because the ticket and tear-off part won't separate too easily when carrying tickets around to distribute.This is a great novelty way to create tickets for a small event. Each ticket must be numbered as the template doesn't do anything for sequential numbering. Avery's ticket stubs are a useful product: templates are available online, with some basic set ups and info you can use to create some GREAT Tickets yourself, which include tear aways stubs (totally useful). Without ticket numbering (with DIFFERENT numbers per ticket) the tickets are useless. The ticket area is big too so you can do some nice artwork on it and it can fit in a ticket book if people want to save the event ticket for memory's sake. This Avery ticket pack is a nice way to make your own tickets.

Fold each ticket back and forth, and they separate from one another.

The ticket stock I usually use is four across, while these are five across.

However, since I needed to properly evaluate this ticket stock, I "took one for the team" and provided this information.
