I would not recommend this for those who need to get EVERYTHING into one gigantic binder. This is the first simple binder I have owned that closes up the entire binder with a ZIPPER. The binder rings are 1", which is more than enough (I hope) for me to use for my notes. The binder rings are on velcro and can be removed, making more space for books, etc.. but I will be keeping them in.All and all I am happy with it, but of course only time will tell how well, with gentle handling, it will hold up, but for now it suites my purpose perfectly. Since then, I've learned that a cheaper binder is fine if it is just going to sit on a shelf holding papers. The binder has a zipper closure to keep its contents securely in place, especially if the binder is accidentally dropped. I love this self-contained binder organizer! This binder takes a different approach. This binder is too flexible for my needs. It's all in one secured binder, easily slipped in and out of his backpack once the metal three-ring binder is removed. (I'm keeping the binder, though, for when usage changes.) When you do open the binder, on the left there is a screened pocket for pens/pencils, a pocket above this with a tab for a calculator, phone, etc. It is easy to organize with this binder. This works for me as this is exactly as I had intended for this binder. However if you were planning to fill the 3 ring binder with just paper you&#699;ll probably find the cover too &#34;floppy&#34; for your needs. The removable binder rings are a nice touch, but there's absolutely no support / backing / firmness to this binder. This is a very flexible binder, slim but not too slim to hold what I need. The binder rings attach with velcro so they can be removed if you want to use it as a portfolio without the rings. This binder felt a little flimsy, but once filled with paper, etc, feels more substantial. The removable binder is clunky at best and doesn't work well either as a binder or when removed. like this soft-cover binder with its feel of a mini-briefcase and the fact the binder size easily can accommodate not only standard 8.5" x 11" letter size paper, but also A4. It is intended to be used within another binder, not as a stand alone. I like the removable three ring binder idea. This particular binder is different from ones that im use to and Im not sure if I like it or not. This binder is super light. This is an odd binder, but perhaps it has features that you will appreciate. When the binder is empty it is floppy and requires two hands to work the zipper to open and close because there is little structure to the binder. This binder packs many features that are often not found on a typical binder. I've used my binder almost every day to keep on top of a slew of doctors' appointments, tests, procedures, and notes. However, the binder can hold a few file folders even without removing this ring mechanism.After a month of daily use, the seams are all still intact, the zippers are all fully functional, and the ring binder mechanism still works. Just make sure you know it's not a hard 'normal' 5 Star binder.
