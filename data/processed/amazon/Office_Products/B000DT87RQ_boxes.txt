These boxes were fairly simple to out together and then had a very sturdy feel to them.I placed 10 hardcover books on top of one of these boxes and it held-up without a problem.The only negative is that the ink rubbed-off onto my skin as I was folding and pressing the flaps into their slots. I love these boxes! These are overall good boxes; I just wouldn't call them good enough to warrant 5 stars. These boxes, however, are truly fantastic. These boxes aren't huge, of course; they're made for document storage, easily fitting legal size paper. But I guess if your boxes will be seen by your clients within your office, than the wood grain might be preferable. But what I really love about these boxes is how easy they are to assemble. !Highly recommend these boxes. Excellent boxes. Other boxes have an assembly sequence that seems to defy logic... and my ability to remember.These boxes also accommodate both letter and legal size file folders. Then Bankers Box boxes slide out easily enough. The boxes were easy to lift, carry and stack. I was able to easily stack nine boxes on top of each other. Furthermore, these boxes are attractive and actually blend in well with my wooden furniture.The Fellowes Bankers Woodgrain Storage Boxes (Item 725) are highly recommended if one is storing important documents and/or collectables in a home office or closet and easy access is required. However, these boxes are too expensive to be used for moving. These are great, very well designed boxes. Love these boxes. We have used boxes similar to these to store his stuff in a rented storage unit. These are the standard boxes for storing documents, etc, that you've seen all your life. I even used to reinforce old boxes with tape. I love these boxes - very useful, and all your garbage looks all nice and neat and orderly once inside and labeled! If you've ever put together Bankers boxes you know how time consuming this can be...and how it can be tiresome...Fret no more as these boxes are very easy to set-up. These are not the ordinary ubiquitous white boxes but a very nice wood grain brown pattern.They also feel sturdy and I look forward to using these boxes to store my home records and computer stuff.Highly recommend. The boxes are easy to assemble, but are better kept out of sight if aesthetics are important to you. The boxes also look good with a brown (wood grain)and white design. The boxes stack fine and the bottom one seems to holding up well considering it has two boxes on it. (I don't like to stack more than three boxes on top of each other because I am afraid the cardboard on the bottom box may break. These boxes are excellent! Overall I love these boxes, they keep my office organized and I couldn't ask for more! These are great little boxes. I'd say I did all 4 boxes and lids in under 10 minutes. I thought they'd be some decent boxes, but they are much better than I pictured!

In comparing this with my other boxes I've noticed a few differences:1.

@highlight

These boxes seem a bit sturdier than my other boxes.Storage boxes in general are unattractive, but they are a necessity.

Those boxes cost about half what these do, and are a little lighter weight, but I'm not personally convinced the price difference is worthwhile.
