If Epson doesn't want the auto-extend paper tray to automatically retract after a certain amount of time, they should at least have a "retract" button.Those negatives aside, you really can't go wrong with an Epson printer, and the XP-800 is one of the best I've tried so far. I'll update if neededIt has a motorized paper tray which automatically slides out. The paper tray only holds about 100 sheets so it has to be refilled often if you print many documents.With a small all in one printer of this size there have to be a few sacrifices. There is a rear paper port for odd sizes of paper, and there are two storage carts. The paper storage trays are a bit difficult to get to. They're under an automated paper reception tray (which doesn't appear to have a button for retraction). It saves paper and we print out a lot of documents for my husband's business and the 2 sided printing means they are much less bulky than before.My only complaints with this machine - and overall, they are minor things - are that I'm not wild about the touch screen aspect of navigation. Plus, there's a rear paper, one at a time, feed slot. Since these paper trays are enclosed, that isn't possible without removing the paper tray.I love the "save to memory device" feature. It prints plain paper sheets just fine. But, main paper tray only holds 100 sheets. I printed on some paper on hand and it REALLY does make a difference.

You will need to load paper more often if you are doing a large print run.

The paper trays are designed for standard copy paper, specialty card stocks, envelopes, labels, etc.

Heavier paper feeds thru just fine.
