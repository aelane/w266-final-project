Before this, I used a gel cushion for 3 years. I have had the cushion for several days now and the relief I have gotten while sitting at my desk is absolutely amazing! Now, with using the cushion I can sit for an hour or more and experience ABSOLUTELY NO PAIN! This cushion does NOT flatten out even with sitting on it every day, and is VERY comfortable. This cushion kept me comfortable throughout the whole trip!The longest driving day was about 11 hours, the shortest around 5...over 53 days. This cushion performed perfectly, keeping me comfy and pain-free. Geez, I can't believe how hard this cushion is! Too bad because the cushion was comfortable.

However, when I first sat down on the cushion, I thought it was going to add padding that my still attractive but older desk chair no longer provides.

Rather than returning it, I will try using the cushion in the driver's seat of my car for extra height and padding and if that doesn't work, it will be used for a cushion on my husband's transport wheelchair as he does not sit in it for any great length of time.

I bought this cushion, thinking it would be as comfortable as my memory foam mattress.
