I love the multiple paper trays and the auto duplex ink. Photos printed on a good glossy paper have lots of vibrance and look good. I can keep one loaded with regular paper and the other stocked with envelopes.I noticed that a number of people complain of difficulties using WiFi with this unit. The upper paper tray is useful for photo paper, and while it "can" hold envelopes, the results there were not very good. The paper feed works well without jamming and the ink tanks are easy to install and replace.Image quality is excellent. The 850 had a rear paper feed, compared to the 922 which only feeds from bottom paper trays. I switch paper a lot, and it is a real nuisance to always have to close the output door, pull out the tray to load a form, then repeat the process to go back to regular paper. Great paper capacity. Loading the paper tray is effortless. It also holds more paper than most printers so refilling is required less often. No unsightly paper holders sticking out, allowing it to sit on the edge of a table without worries of someone catching the paper tray as they walk by. The paper catch automatically opens when an item is being printed, however one must physically close it when finished. There are two paper trays, the lower one is for 8.5x11, and the up for specialized media. (2) The paper feeder is not flawless.

The paper trays are a little misleading; there are two trays, but one is for photo paper.

It also doesn't print 11x17 paper.

The Epson was so temperamental with paper, that they should have included a large "kick me" button on the front panel.Card Stock?
