I use this laminator for a variety of business and personal needs, and it is very easy to use, relatively inexpensive, and reliable. We'll see how this laminator holds up over time, but from my first impression I feel confident it will. Still, it's an excellent laminator. This laminator is built like a tank - esp. My current page-size laminator is difficult to set up and take down. This will help keep the laminator clean. This laminator takes longer than the GBC model that I have to warm up. After my laminator arrived, I immediately put it to use laminating gift tags to tie to some christmas presents. I guess this laminator could be used in a real office environment where there is higher demand, as it certainly looks like it is built for it. Some other laminator I used generated a burn plastic smell, not this one. This laminator works really well -- relatively fast warm-up times, glitch-free document feeding, picture perfect lamination seals with no air bubbles, oversize document capability (up to 12.5" wide) -- I can't think of anything more I'd want or need from a laminator. This is a really great laminator and I'm quite happy with it. If you need a laminator, this is a good one to get -- go for it! The Fellowes Saturn 125 12.5-Inch laminator was designed for moderate use at home or in a small office. Once warmed up, the laminator worked as it should. This laminator can handle photos as well as standard paper documents.If you're looking for a basic, uncomplicated laminator for light to moderate use, the Fellowes Saturn 125 office laminator is worthy of consideration.PROS:Includes laminating starter kitCompact modern designSimple to useCan laminate photos2 year limited warrantyCONS:Occasional grinding noiseCool touch a little on the warm side So far this  laminator has proven to be perfect for the uses intended in the office I work. The laminator is incredibly light and very easy to carry from one place to another.It is designed for 3- or 5-mil pouches, a package with 10 3 mil pouches is included in the box so you can start using immediately without having to worry about getting any materials needed. I've been using my laminator for the recipes, so the next time I can just wipe the recipe off instead of printing out another one.This is great for that, my sheets are 8.5" x 11" copier paper and the fit is perfect. This laminator will go up to 12.5" wide, the other Saturn model (95)Fellowes Saturn SL95 9.5IN Office Laminatorwould have been even more suited for the recipes I'm laminating.It takes around 5 or 6 minutes to heat up, there is quite a bit of a burning odor when the laminator is new, after doing 10 pages, I'm not noticing the odor as much now.T
