Very nice pencil sharpener.Positives:- creates a great sharpened tip.- auto shut off- sturdyNegatives:- very very big. This is a very substantial pencil sharpener. This pencil sharpener, while somewhat pricey, works! Stops automatically when the pencil is sharp and signals with a small blue light on the top. I am currently using a classic Panasonic Auto-Stop pencil sharpener. Unlike my current pencil sharpener, the X-Acto ProX also has a circular adjust ring with different size holes depending on the pencil size. So this pencil sharpener is pretty big at about 6 inches height and depth, and so big that weight and the friction pad on his base will keep him from moving when you push pencils into the opening. He also comes with auto-stop and LED light when the "correct pencil point is achieved", but I stop it a little before that so the point is a little blunter and won't break that easily.Overall, we have no complaint with this industrial grade pencil sharpener sitting in our home, and right now we're actually kind of busy hunting through the whole house looking for more pencils to sharpen. Somehow found some pencil shavings outside the basket, so fit could be improved on (deducted 1 star...would have just taken 1/2 staff if option were available).Noise is typical of pencil sharpeners - certainly tolerable. Normally, I have to empty my electric pencil sharpener twice a day, now it is more like twice a week. Once the pencil is sharpened a light comes on to indicate that sharpening is finished. When the pencil is sharpened, the motor automatically shuts off and the blue LED illuminates to indicate the sharpening is complete. When I used the largest pencil size, it totally bogged down - had to stop and start three times until the pencil was finally sharpened - and it chewed away too much of the length - probably because I had to restart three times.If you sharpen the standard sizes, this will work great. I strongly recommend this pencil sharpener for small schools, or other groups that have time sensitive and precise sharpening needs.
