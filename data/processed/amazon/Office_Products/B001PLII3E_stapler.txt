First of all, I have to give this stapler props for how great it looks. I needed a stapler that could do a lot of pages.This works great EXCEPT when it jams, which is has on me several times. OK, it's a stapler. This stapler makes it soooo easy to go through big stacks of paper, and only use 1 staple. the first stapler lasted about three weeks and then it quit working. This stapler is easy and doesn&#8217;t give me difficulty in stapling things together at all. I love this stapler. I know it is odd to get excited about a stapler, but I hate having to push hard to staple only to find it didn't go all the way through the stack.It looks cool (I love gray and orange).Very easy to load staples.Super easy to staple even a thick pile of papers without having bent staples. First off, if you want to open the stapler to load the staples, you need to press the button on the back and then pull the tray out. I was shocked by how much easier it is to push down than my old standard stapler. I'll definitely continue to use my normal standard stapler for very small packets of paper and only whip this one out for large packets. I just realized I had allowed a marvelous, easy, easy, easy stapler into my home. Easy, terrific stapler. I had to go back to my old stapler and I couldn't believe how hard it was for me to staple. This new stapler really does the job, especially when the overall paper thickness is on the heavy side. This industrial stapler will handle all the office needs. This stapler is sleek and staples beautifully. Therefore, I would not recommend this stapler for everyday office use. It is not a super quiet stapler, however, compared to electronic staplers that used to be the best option in the higher capacity range, it is very quiet. (It's about as loud as a standard stapler.) This stapler came with a box of staples with an indicated replacement part ID of #3550, which is a staple that indicates a maximum of 60 pages. Using them with this stapler in the 70 page range was quite effective while still leaving an adequate margin on the back to hold the sheets securely.I have loaded a picture with a few notes for more clarity. It also is a very attractive stapler, if that matters. This stapler does the job and does it great. I love this stapler. My regular stapler wasn't strong enough to staple all of the pages. This stapler can honestly staple 70 pages easily. I'm lazy enough that I bought an electric stapler a dozen years ago and use it for everything in my home office. When I first tried the stapler, I used about 50 magazine pages as a test. The stapler jammed. I have a heavy-duty stapler from Staples that I've used for years. This Swingline stapler, on the other hand, is not only compact and attractive, it's also incredibly easy to use and makes my heavy-duty stapler almost redundant. My heavy-duty stapler can handle maybe a hundred pages (when loaded with long staples), while most light-duty staplers will handle only ten to fifteen pages.

This stapler has substantial heft and a pretty big footprint, but is worth the space it takes on your desk.

I already had a stapler on one desk, but thought it might be nice to have one on the other.

This stapler was so easy it was like stapling butter.
