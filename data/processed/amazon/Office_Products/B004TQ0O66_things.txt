All of these things have stayed put for weeks without falling down. I like them best to post things on a flat surface with the shape fully visiable -which means I am only using one side and the other is entirely exposed as a decorative feature.Each shape will hold up to 3/4 pound and I did use both sides of two shapes to put up a wooden trivet that I had used as a base for a ribbon weave wall hanging.I really think it is a waste to use the shapes - circles, stars, hearts to adhere items in scrapbooks where they are used totally as a tool rather than part of the design. I love these things! They hold things in place or curling edges down. I really enjoy using these things. Which can be either good or bad depending on what and where you want to hang things. These are the neatest little things and I shook my head wondering why I didn't think of them! One of the things that we really liked about these is that they are reusable.

I love these things!

These things are a huge improvement over the tack/putty stuff.

But it's best to use these cute little things in a picture book where you have no plans of removing them... For throw away paperwork these are great - again wash them off and use them again....
