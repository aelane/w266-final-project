You can EASILY slide out the writing on the paper and replace it with another one, instead of having to add a new label onto the folder, or even (environmentally) worse, throwing away the whole folder.So far they've been pretty durable (I haven't had any problems within about a month and a half). The paper inserts are well made as well, and actually fit into the plastic sleeves. It includes paper labels. Thick paper inserts are included. Additionally, if you don't slide the paper insert into both the bottom & top holder, you will see a line across your printed insert because the tab design is such that you slide your paper insert into the tab. They come with the little paper inserts you need too. Just insert the paper tab and you're ready to go.Going to order more of these! They clamp right onto any paper or thin-enough object. They are slightly tinted (frosted) and include the paper to put inside the tabs. Some are too small to fit the paper insert inside properly, and on and on.The Smead are great! The paper insert fits inside perfectly. Once you label the paper insert that goes inside the tabs they are ready to go and the tabs themselves have great grip, but if you need to move them, they can be moved without much fuss.

They slide on easily to my paper folders, they hang on better then the ones you have to insert.

There is a large white paper insert where information about the folder can be written.
