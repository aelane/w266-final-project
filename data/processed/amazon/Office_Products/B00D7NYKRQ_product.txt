I think this product is great for kids, or for a dorm room. *I've uploaded a product image that basically says the same things as this review...The marginal areas of this board are rather large, but the benefit of this is more space to grasp the board if you do not put it up on a wall. I was a little disappointed to discover that this product is not actually a CHALKBOARD but just a black plastic-type board. it's a decent product, but just not as nice as i was hoping for. I requested this product thinking my kids would enjoy it, and they have. This is a great product to use around the house or as an advertisement board at businesses. Overall I am incredibly happy with this product. All in all a great product at a SUPER price! Would love this product if it was larger.

How hard is it to demonstrate the product, on the packaging, by taking an actual photograph of something written in chalk on this make and model of blackboard?
