It came out looking much more like a commercially printed photo. They don't look quite as good as getting them from an actual photo store, but they are pretty good and of course it's convenient to be able to print right from your own home instead of running down the road to the nearest pharmacy or Wal-Mart/Target/etc. I have a Canon 3-in-1, an huge Epson photo printer, and now this Epson 400 series. I really do not feel that this is a photo quality printer. This photo file size was 12.5 MBytes - don't know why it was a smaller file size. When I tried to scan a photo, the printer would not list my PC as a destination and was listing a USB connection as the only option. It's not a great photo printer (and it eats up ink like nobody's business), so I just use it for basic things like documents that might have simple color images. I used the "best photo quality" setting and high quality, glossy photo paper but the resulting photo was no better than a medium quality draft. We have a photo printer for the 4x6 images we need, and this unit excels at the basics, so no need to try to reinvent the wheel with this unit. With that being said, this should not be confused for a photo printer. Then I ran a full-size photo on regular copy paper. Not a photo quality printer but prints images in more than acceptable quality.

It also has a photo restoring function which I want to try out later and report back on just how good it works.

The photo print quality was excellent.

I scanned another glossy 8X10 photo at 1200 DPI and made no corrections and printed the photo.
