I take these right off the printer and put on a box , pressing and smoothing with my hands - and no ink smears - ever. Do not jam in printer. I'm sure these will work with whatever printer and software you're used to using for printing shipping labels. They run through the printer with no trouble. I was using regular printer paper and packing tape for a long time, but this is faster and looks much more professional. (My printer just cannot handle multiple printings without incorrectly feeding multiple sheets. These printer labels are great for "clic & ship" by the USPS. Do remember how they go into your printer though - ours is an Artisan 800 and you have to put them in upside down and backwards due to the way they're fed through.

It worked.Every printer is different, so you will need to do your own test as to which end is up, but if you need to do shipping using online services, these are exactly what you want.

Once the printer is working properly I am hoping the labels will print perfectly and I will update this review to indicate this.Because I suspect it might be my printer and not the labels itself, I am giving them four stars because they do stick well.I have am OfficeJetPro HP K550 printer.

I leave it sitting in the printer for a few minutes and have never had an issue with smeared ink.
