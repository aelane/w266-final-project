However, though I have found it does sharpen my pencils, it takes more time than you would expect and does not get the pencil as sharp as some other sharpeners that I have used. The pencils came out nice and sharp as well.This could easily be replaced with a simple hand turn razor blade style sharpener. It has sharpened 4 or so pencils so far for me with no issues, but I would of rather spent a bit more on something that will last forever (since I can tell right away this wont). The pencils sharpen quickly, you can adjust the size pencil, and it has auto-stop! And it sharpened all of our colored pencils quickly and perfectly. So, If you're requiring super sharp pencils, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. It feels a little under-powered, and struggles a little with some pencils, but it managed to sharpen a collection of various #2 pencils, colored pencils, and others of varying strengths and compositions without stopping completely.I'll keep it on my desk. It's not like I sharpen pencils every day in this digital age, anyway.I'm docking a star for the cheap construction and parts, and cutting another star for the unit being defective upon arrival-- It never should have left their factory that way! Not all of my pencils are having the problem, but its happening about half the time, with no correlation to temperature or age (the older USA-made pencils are breaking just as often as the newer and more brittle Mexican-made ones).For regular pencils this works fine, with two caveats. This works pretty well to sharpen our pencils to a nice sharp point.The USB cable this came with retracts into itself and is very compact. The pencils come out sharp and smooth! 2 pencils. As you sharpen colored pencils, everyone understands that sharpening colored pencils is a tough process. I just sharpened about 40 colored pencils for my students working on a project and I did not have one mistake.

It is a little loud but It does evenly sharpen pencils for my son.

Brand new pencils were left with a tiny flat spot were the point should be.

Dull pencils were left with a still blunt tip.
