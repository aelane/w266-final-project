excellent service. I also learned that it is not free service. Since I have the fastest Internet service available from any ISP, clearly this is not the problem. I just installed my Ooma Telo to replace my existing Vonage service. I called them to find out that they completely canceled my service. I had ATT and local service with just caller ID and no long distance was forty five dollars a month. First, I need to say that when OOMA works, that the service is good, but the voice quality could be improved. The Premium service is worth the money as it adds a lot of features that other phone companies don't offer. The OOMA service is good, I can't say that about the hardware. If you are looking for reliable service, OOMA is not it.2) The OOMA Telo units cannot be repaired. If you just want the basic service which is a phone line with unlimited calls within the USA and I believe Canada all you pay is for the tax and service charges. and that I lived within their service area (check! Then I signed up for Ooma's Premium service and requested to have my home phone number ported over to Ooma (awesome! As soon as I had service, the Ooma came back to life and our phone service kicked back in.We've been using it for about two months now and we LOVE it!!! The Premium service gives some cool features like sending a text when a voicemail is received, call forwarding to my cell if we have a network outage and blacklisting numbers. You can use Ooma without the Premier service too and just pay a few bucks in taxes every month. It has  been providing reliable service for over a year. If you use cell service and would be interested in a backup service then get an Ooma and rest easy. And, with the Premiere service any calls that might come in while the Telo is down are routed to my cell phone so we don't miss any calls. If you stay with the basic service, here in Texas it's like 3.74 a month..Really? The Ooma service has not so much has hiccuped and has worked beautifully. OOMA's basic service is quite good and far from crippled.What is the OOMA Telo?A device that connects between your existing phones (wired or wireless or both) and the internet to make phone calls. Their "premiere" service, offers a number of very advanced features (see their website) and costs an additional $10.00 a month added to the previously mentioned $4.00 a month charge. So to be clear - the premiere service costs about $14.00 a month and OOMA's basic service costs about $4.00 a month. The basic service didn't fulfill my needs so I went for the Premier service, which was normally $119 for a year, however, I used the promotion at the time and purchased the Premier level for $99.99 for the year and the number porting is included. Also, if there is an Ooma service outage, I put my cellphone number down so that I never miss any calls. Customer service walked me through adjusting the Quality of Service settings one the Ooma (also web based) and it pretty much cleared up. They have made the service almost as good as AT&T and there is only a few glitches like the Ooma answering service will pick up the call and you will have to log onto the internet with speakers attached to your computer to hear the call. If you have Premier service and during your Premier trial, you can also call Canada for free.One surprise and drawback for international calls is that you must add money (minimum $10) to your pre-paid account before calling. I did subscribe to the PREMIUM service for the first year for $120 because you do get a free port ($40). For now, very pleased with the service and find myself raving about it just as my coworker did to me!! Customer service was sort of helpful: I disconnected and reconnected the cables but couldn't get the telo to work again. Customer service diagnosed a cable that mysteriously went bad but they would not send a new one. Customer service helpfully suggested I go to Radio Shack for a new cable in that case.
