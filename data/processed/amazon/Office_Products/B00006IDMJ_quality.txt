Five Star Notebooks have always been the quality notebooks since I was going to High School or even Middle School. It's durable, high quality and price fairly. I'm really pleased with the quality of this notebook, especially for the price! There are nice quality folders inside for tucking in loose pieces of paper. The top-notch quality is an important feature, for storing important notes, and valuable information. I may pay a little more for the quality, but my important documents and work is worth it. It even has one high quality cardboard pocket inside the front cover for loose papers, and the top edge of that pocket is reinforced with plastic.Good on Mead for keeping up the quality with their flagship product. This is a solid, reliable, high quality spiral bound multi-subject folder. good quality no smudge paper, erasures do not thin the pages. This is good quality and this was a great price. This is due to their good quality paper, excellent spiral wire quality, and the nice plastic cover from protection. It is also quite reasonably priced for the quality you get. Mead took what was already a quality product and improved upon it, which makes us pretty happy. Five Star has always made quality products at affordable prices and as far as i'm concerned this notebook is no different. It's not high quality bond, but this is a notebook which is likely to be used for school notes and later thrown away.
