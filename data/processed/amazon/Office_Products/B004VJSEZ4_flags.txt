That being said, these flags are a great, economical and reusable solution for anyone looking to non-permanently mark items. The flags are great for marking places, and I was glad to get them.I did a test with the Avery flags to see how they stand up to repeated use. I took some flags and put them in a book, then took them out and repositioned them. You might not want to reposition them, since they're so inexpensive, but it's nice to know you can if you want to.These are really good flags and I recommend them. Discovering these flags is a onetime event; discovering things to do with them is never-ending.Obviously, to mark your place in books, reports, and documents. There, I place "used" flags that I no longer need so I can use them again. With these flags, I can use the color codes to indicate what recipes are a priority to try (red), and which ones I have all the ingredients for already (green), etc.My son likes using them with his textbooks. I used these Avery flags to mark the pages. I can put the flags over text without obscuring it. I don't know how I got along without these handy flags. I first saw the Avery flags when either LL Bean or Land's End provided them in their Christmas catalog. I used different colored flags for different family members; red marks the sweater and slippers for dad, green indicates the polo and flannel shirt for Uncle, and so on.Some other uses for this handy product:1. I found these flags to be very good for marking pages. That could come in very handy for keeping the flags right within reach.Recommended if you need a narrower, 1/2 inch wide flag. I have used these little flags for years and love them. I keep these flags handy and mark interesting projects as I go. If there are no flags, I can recycle it. I then return the flags near the top again and repeat. I highly recommend these Avery flags. I love these little flags because I like to mark favorite passages in books I read so I can find them later, but I don't like to annotate my books (or even worse, dog-ear them). I love these little flags because they save me a lot of time. So I use flags to mark pages so I can find the information quickly. You can even write on the flags to make searching even easier. I love using sticky flags. There isn't too much you can say about sticky flags but I was a little disappointed that these were a little flimsy. I love using these little flags for identifying important parts of a document or book. These colorful flags, neatly secured on a sturdy clear plastic holder, offer huge organization results. The flags you use to keep track of the notes. I use these flags to mark recipes in my cookbooks and magazines and also they are great for using in my travel books when I am researching a trip, or carrying the book with me. I've been using these Avery flags for years now, and I just keep finding more uses and more applications for them. These flags are a great choice! I would like for these flags to have a bit more sticking endurance. It's great to be able to reuse the flags when the trial is over. The 3M Post-it flags that we use at home and at work come in a little, very convenient paper and plastic "case," if it even merits being called a case. These Avery flags are also approximately half the width of the 3M flags, which, for me, is a positive, since I rarely actually need to write anything on the flags. The 3M and Avery flags are comparable in texture, stickiness, and ease of removal. With the Avery flags, she's able to color code materials and reference with ease. There are 100 flags (20 red, 20 orange, 20 yellow, 20 green, and 20 blue). Post-it makes flags out of paper (basically regular Post-it notes cut into strips), and those would be much better for that use.What's great about these is that they're brightly colored and sturdy. These Avery flags are designed for marking passages in books, places in documents that you want to draw attention to, pointing out signature lines, etc. These flags are a smaller version of the ones I'm used to using and I just love them. These flags are meant for marking pages in a book, or color-coding papers, or that sort of thing. These flags are quite useful: the clear ends ensure that you don't cover any text, the different colors allow for classification of markers, and they stick well while still coming off the page cleanly. These flags are ubiquitous in our office and home. These flags come in a convenient carrying case (that can be used as a bookmark or tucked into a notebook). These flags from Avery are handy for bookmarking. The flags are more likely to smudge when written on but are more durable than paper.Each package includes a Box Tops for Education coupon.As a side note, these are made in China. These flags have a laminated feel to them, which has a plus side and a minus side. So far I'm pretty impressed with them, but if you are looking for flags to easily write on I would recommend another product. These little flags are perfect for marking your place in cookbooks or magazines. These little flags are the best! These stick well like the flags from other  companies that are already on the market. What can I say, these great Avery flags, in standard colors (red, orange, yellow, green and blue) are a great office product: multiple purpose, easy-to-use and removable! What I like about these flags is they stand out without sticking way out and they are fairly sticky which means I am not spending a lot of time trying to get them back in. You can't go wrong with these flags; bright, removable, holds tight enough, but removes easy too. The little flags are so useful! I use flags also to mark passages and pages in books for quick access to information I want to locate quickly -- i.e. The flags can be reapplied many times so they are a good buy. These flags are PERFECT for the organizing freak in you. The flags are great for marking books, contract "look at this section" and also for signature lines. In the past flags like this came in individualized packs of one color. These flags are much nicer and easier to use than the previous method I used to flag pages:  I'd cut a regular-sized sticky note into strips, a method which works, but is rather a hassle to put into practice. These Avery flags are so much nicer. The flags also seem to work on all paper types, from the heavy, glossy stock paper to the cheap pulp used in paperback books (although Avery does recommend testing before using as the adhesive may mark some surfaces or lift inks, none of which I've found to happen but you never know). With the flags being multicolored, you can easily assign different values or headings for each color, making something like studying a breeze.T
