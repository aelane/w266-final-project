I use labels for organizing my reloading equipment and components. The labels look as if they are forever, or when deliberately removed. I can print labels from my iPad as well as QR codes and barcodes. The labels available for this unit are vast. Iron on labels. I love using labels to stay organized, especially in my pantry where I transfer all of my dry goods to clear storage containers and label accordingly. I definitely found it easier and faster to create labels using the iPhone app than with either of my two previous Brother labelers. I love that Epson offers labels that are as pretty as they are functional and hope they come out with even more designs and colors in the future. Using Brother's labels for food containers I've noticed they have a tendency to curl up over time allowing food particles to get underneath. I'll be curious to see how Epson's labels compare, though I do like that they also offer strong adhesive tapes meant for outdoor uses. It can do labels in 1/4&#34; 3/8&#34;, 1/2&#34;, 3/4&#34; and 1&#34;. Handwritten labels, numerous script designs, numerous icons and even a QR code. The Epson Labelworks does this exceptionally well with perfect labels that are easy to make and customize.One great feature of this printer is that it has the option of being powered by 6 AA batteries. And I like to print out labels for the mess of cables coming off my main Ethernet switch. Furthermore, you can print labels with simple included clipart icons.Even better, I can include a QR code on my labels. You can get really creative with your labels, here&#8217;s an example I thought up. After printing quite a few labels, my desk is littered with small pieces of tape. It comes with labels to start. There are different labels you can get, from 1/4 to 1 inch. Apparently there are other labels available including ones that are ribbon shape and ones with a separate adhesive tab for labeling cords. It prints labels that any Epson ilabel maker uses, so if you have a portable machine or something similar it'll work great.IN the box it has a cable for connecting to your computer, a power cord, a starter cartridge, and instructions. I was printing labels within minutes after I had downloaded the app from the Apple App Store.The third most important thing to know is that this labeler will take label cartridges as narrow as " and as wide as 1".
