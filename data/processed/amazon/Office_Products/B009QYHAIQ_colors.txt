And I think if you like bright colors and vibrant ink, you might find these disappointing. With five different colors, they would work well for on-paper editing by a team; each person's comments would be in its own color. )The Acroballs have five lovely colors which are indeed very vibrant. I really like the colors of these pens, but overall, I prefer the Sarasas. The colors included are purple, pink, blue, orange and green, a nice assortment to start with. All of these colors are bright and beautiful, even the pink and light blue stand out and are easy to read, but unlike some gel pens they dry so quickly on contact that they don&#8217;t smear. How dark can you really make those colors? I just don't think the colors are as fun.As a doctoral student, I take notes in different colors. While I like the colors, which are true to exactly what color it states, they are not as smooth as my InkJoys. I love the bright colors of these pens and how smoothly they write.

The colors in the set we have are purple, pink, green, blue and orange, but you can get these pens in different colors, black included. These are really the colors shown.
