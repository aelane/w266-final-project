Next I installed the ink cartridges as instructed (flawless process). It could have been the ink cartridges I bought from Ebay that had expired expiration dates (I refused to spend nearly $80 for replacement black and color cartridges), or maybe the printer head went bad, but in any case I was ready for a change. I haven't actually priced Canon ink, but the fact that you can buy them separately means you only buy what you need, and even three color cartridges cost the same (or a little more as an HP tri color cartridge), you will still save money unless you use the exact same amount of ink in every print job.The Canon MP560 is packed with cool and useful features that leave you wondering why it doesn't cost more. I haven't used it enough yet to determine how long the ink cartridges last. I loved the individual ink cartridges, which made it more affordable to use, and I have always ordered those from Amazon (and never refilled or generic). I like the 5 separate ink cartridge system, and love how easy to replace the cartridge. Pros* holds 2 black ink cartridges* lights up INSIDE the printer when new ink is loaded properly. Pigment-based ink, on the other hand, are not water-soluble and resist bleeding (thus they are better suited for use in printing text).- Automatic Double-Sided (or "Duplex") PrintingWith duplex printing, double-sided printing is done automatically without the need for user intervention i.e. Incidentally, the MX870 uses the same ink cartridges as the MP560. If you don't that will mean the ink was taken out of the box or the printer was already used and that may mean a returned or refurbished item that is not worth full price.I purchased this from a local store when it first came out. It's got the same four ink tanks I'm used to, though slightly smaller in size (#221 vs. #6) with the typical oversized pigment black for text.
