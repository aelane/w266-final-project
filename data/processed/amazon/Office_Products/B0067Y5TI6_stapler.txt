This sparkly red Bostitch stapler is rather heavy and well-built. The stapler takes regular standard staples, and it staples up to 25 sheets, which is way more than my little Swingline can do at a time.I really like this stapler, especially because of the number of sheets it can staple and because it opens to staple to a wall. So I love this stapler mostly because it is red BUT in case that isn't interesting to you, this stapler has some great features.First off- it is antimicrobial- so if you are using it with a bunch of kids, hopefully it will decrease the amount of fomite contamination you receive.It has a nifty little compartments(I love nifty little compartments) to store extra staples so if you don't happen to know where your box of refill staples are RIGHT-THIS-MINUTE, you can just whip out some from the secret compartment.It takes 'S' or Standard stapes and says it staples up to 25 sheets. this is a pretty strong, well-built stapler even if it isn't huge. If you think a stapler is just a stapler you will be surprised with this one. This stapler really can staple 25 sheets of copy paper together with little fuss (yes, I tried it, along with stapling bristol board and cardboard together). This stapler can stand upright on your desk to save space, and it can also be be opened flat to staple (i.e., tack) to a wall-mounted board or for use with fabrics.The color is more Candy Apple Red thanMiltonRed, but that's fine with me. It replaced the lightweight black stapler that is usually bought at school supply time and lasts for about a year before it breaks and gets thrown out.I can already tell that this one will last far longer. I mean, it's fine, but if I were looking for a sexy stapler, I'm not sure this is the one I'd choose. This stapler is far more stapler than I really need -- I rarely use its full capacity (25 sheets! I like that this is a heavy-duty stapler and stands up to the workout we put it through! So unless you routinely need a more powerful stapler, this would be all you need for standard office work. This stapler works perfectly well; doesn't seem to jam, doesn't need a lot of force. I don't know, as I haven't bought a stapler in a long time. I gave this stapler 4 stars.
