The system looks nice and modern, handsets are light and comfortable, LCDs are high contrast and very easy to read, and the buttons are illuminated. Had a Panasonic DECT 6 system for many years and it worked well but finally some of the handsets bit the dust. I had a very nice Uniden DECT 6.0 system that I've been using, but when the batteries started not holding a charge after a year or so, I thought I'd look around at other systems before replacing the battery. The first Panasonic system I got had very long lasting batteries but they were special batteries that are impossible to find after 5 years. The system will support 2 cell phones at a time, in addition to 1 bluetooth headset. Considering that this system cost about $25.00 less than the 5.8 GHz system I bought 10 years ago with only 3 handsets, I would say this is a very good value for the money. * Answering system plays back calls with clear sound* Base set and chargers are slim, taking up less room than their predecessors* Announced incoming calls let you decide whether to pick-up the phone--or not* Limited choice of ringtones* Use of phone as an intercom is possible--just not as simple as pressing a button* Sound is spectacularly clear and crisp* Range is excellent. The system was simply opened previously and then returned.

I was able to purchase the system for under $100 back before Christmas in 2012.

If you find this system for under $100, and need a cordless phone system, that is definately a buy point...UPDATE  12-6-13:I wanted an update on this phone after using it for two and a half years.

The AT&T; system was used with the landline, but I recently switched to cable internet and Ooma Telo with wireless adapter, and decided to replace the phone system.Panasonic KX-TG7644M has everything I was looking for in the system including a power backup feature (although this feature is less valuable for me now when I am using Ooma service than when I was still using a landline).
