As a foot rest, this is probably as close as it comes to ideal. It's heavy with rubber foot pads, so it doesn't slide when you put weight on it. First, the foot platform sits is connected to the mount platform via 1 bolt in the middle of either side. But moving the foot rest around via the channels in the mount platform is not entirely easy, but I don't see it being something you need to do quite often anyway.The price of the foot rest is a little high in my opinion. This foot rest allows me to keep my feet off the tile so they stay comfortable. Using the foot rest took the pressure off my lower back as soon as I set my feet onto it.The unit is made of heavy gauge steel and arrived together and ready to use right out of the box - no assembly required. This foot rest is easy to set up and is very sturdy. I picked this foot rest simply because I'm up late at night most nights working on college assignments. I remember how the foot rest was so beneficial to me at my old workplace but felt that was the lowest priority as most injuries are to the wrist and arms but I started noticing that my legs were feeling numb (and even had it checked out medically).Aside from having to walk more and not stay in the same seating position for hours, I needed to purchase an adjustable footrest and sure enough, I gave the 3M foot rest a try.Unlike previous foot rests I used with the removable rest and the metal bar which swivels, this foot rest also swivels but it's nice and wide, made of steel and has a good grip as well. This is an amazing foot rest. This foot rest does shift on wooden floors. This foot rest does allow for a more ergonomic position and, although it takes a little getting used to, it begins to grant some relief to those who work on their computer for a good part of the day. As far as foot rests go this one is pretty nice. I originally thought that foot rests were desigined for short people but in my 6' case I also find this to be very comforting while sitting at my desk. You've seen some foot rests in your time? I've owned 3 previous foot rests and they've all wound up in garage sales for one reason or another. The foot rest is wide enough to give you plenty of room to spread your feet out on, and the textured surface is comfortable underfoot, whether you're in your stocking feet, barefoot, or wearing shoes. If you're looking for a foot rest, this is a good one to go with! This tilting foot stool comes out of the box complete, is a solid metal frame construction, and does indeed tilt to 30 degrees. I use the foot rest as a change of position and it really helps when I can put one foot up, or the other down, or both on, or both off, .. you get the idea. This foot rest is solid and the all metal construction really is a big deal. I have long looked for a well constructed foot rest that would improve my ergonomics at my home office. This will outlast any plastic foot rest several times over.Adjusts easily  -- I have left the angle adjustment loose so I can rock my feet back and forth allowing for increased flexibility and comfort.Stays in place and does not walk along my carpet (unlike the lighter weight one I have at work)Since I use this at home I am often bare foot. This foot rest is heavy. This foot rest is great for us. It was like no foot rest I have ever seen (nevermind that a piece of wood or a phone book would do). This foot rest is wide, just like I remember the ones from my old job. This foot rest allows foot angles that feel natural, and it virtually "lifts up" the floor! The foot pad is wide enough for the Sasquatch and small enough for the dainty-footed.After using the foot rest for a day, I have to say it's been nice to have it in place. 3M has made the perfect foot rest that I've been looking for, for literally decades! The foot rest is adjustable to make it the angle you want for your own customized comfort with 4 disc turning screws and 4 wing nuts. This foot rest is very sturdy. I really like this foot rest. It's not like the unsightly purple plastic foot rest of one of my colleagues.
