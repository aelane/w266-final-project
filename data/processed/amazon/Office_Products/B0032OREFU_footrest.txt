AND, if you don't want to use it as a footrest, it is designed to sit up on its side and blow out towards you. As a footrest this is as good as any. What is unique about this footrest is the "climate control". This footrest is built to last. This heated/cooled footrest is a really interesting idea. I currently have a footrest under my desk so that I can vary my posture throughout the day. First of all, this footrest is very tall. So if I use this footrest in the flat position, I have to put my knees in front of my desk or table. I may disassemble this footrest and install a quieter fan. This is a good footrest, but I wish that it offered more options. I gave her this footrest to try out and she chimed back with some positive and negatives.Positives:1. This works well, it's a nice footrest and the heat seems fine, the fan is "barely there," though. I've never owned/used a footrest before. What about a footrest with a fan?The fan is mostly a gimmick. I used it as a footrest for the most part, since I like to sit up higher to work on my computer and need some support on my feet to help with my back. And yes, you can get a decent footrest for $10.Last week I moved into a "penthouse office" while the AC was not installed yet. The Fellowes Climate Control Footrest is a well-functioning footrest that does everything it says it will, with one major flaw.It fits easily under your desk and measures about 16.5" wide by 9.5" deep. I really like having a footrest under my desk.
