The folders are colored so you can code them according to your own personal system. Great folders. These are very nice folders, typical quality of the Smead brand. These folders are a bit different because each folder contains 3 pockets within to help you further separate papers (it beats using paper clips). I really enjoy using these folders. The folders are tabbed on the left making them usable as file folders... For the highly organized, or those that want to be, I totally recommend these Smead folders. I used these folders for each of my therapy students and they've worked out well. I didn't like traditional 2-pocket folders because the papers would fold at the edges. These folders solve this problem by having a little catch on top to keep the papers straight. Aside from that these are the best folders I've had the chance to use! The SuperTab folders look and superficially act like ordinary file folders (which I rather like). You get 12 folders in the pack, 3 of each color (yellow, blue, red, and green). Well, Smead has managed to do that and more with their SuperTab folders. These Smead folders are also a bit taller to handle oversized letter documents or photos.So why not 5 stars? Don't get me wrong, these folders are definitely heavier than your average manilla folder, but they're not as durable as other solutions (eg. I am using these folders for my engineering projects when I go out in the field. Unlike regular folders these folders each have three compartments in one. These folders have come at a very opportune time. If you're looking for vibrantly coloured, durable folders, it's worth it to spend a bit more to get the Smead folders.

You don't think much about folders until something you were using falls out, then folds are important.

I think these folders are amazing, and I highly recommend them to anyone who likes to work with the best designed office supplies.

These are pretty handy folders, with quite a bit more utility than standard file folders.
