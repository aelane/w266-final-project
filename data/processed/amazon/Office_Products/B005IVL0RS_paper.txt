Bigger and with better paper handling than the small inkjets, but less footprint than the larger sized Epson Workforce series. TWO paper feed trays--no more constant paper restocking.9. Not overall, but when you open it up and around the paper feed, the plastic could be more durable. I've only had a paper jam once (knock on wood), and that occurred while printing out a 60+ page document. This is nice for photo paper or something like that. And, its paper tray holds about 500 sheets before needing to add more paper.If that's not enough for you, using Epson Connect that the printer provides, you'll be able to print from most mobile devices. Though its quite simple to add more paper, it is sort of a convenience to not have to do this as often.2.) * Two paper trays allow you to keep photo paper and plain paper loaded simultaneously (but see the gotcha below). I've got 4x6 photo paper in Tray 1. This means that if you want to keep photo paper and plain paper loaded all the time, you will need to specify Tray 2 every time you print a text document. Especially loading paper from the top section, everything was easy to do.What I love about this printer is the way it uses paper and loads, unlike many other cheaper printers in which paper gets stuck and you get the awful paper jam, I never had to worry about it with these type of printers. Grabs paper easy and had no issues at all.Printing was quick and for the most part, while the touch-pad is very nice, for me and my needs for office use, I needed a printer that can hold more paper and this printer was perfect for my needs.Most people will probably not need the double cartridge and the 635, 630 or the Epson Artisan printers may be all that they need, but if you are looking for workhorse, then the Epson WorkForce 845 wireless color printer is definitely recommended for those who very active with printing! (Tray 2 is for plain paper only, though. Love the extra large paper tray and the print, while not commercial quality, is quite fast and perfect for a small home office situation.Ink does seem to last a decent length of time although will not compare to a laser (of course) and the energy savings/green designation is appreciated.Love the front USB access ports! I'm using the second paper tray for envelopes, so I can easily print them as needed. It also helps on saving paper to get into the habit of printing your documents double-sided.ScanningIs straightforward and simple. the paper trays are a bit flimsy but isn't everything these days? Enough paper capacity for an entire ream of 8.5x11 paper (distributed between two 250 sheet paper trays)3. I presume it will work just as nicely from my iPhone.Having two paper trays is great. It has two paper trays which was a nice treat for being able to keep photo paper and letter paper in there at all times.There are slots for memory cards so you can take your SD card right from your camera, stick it in the printer, and print photos using the touch screen on the All-in-One.Making copies takes a little longer than I'd like but for a home network device, it's truly terrific. Actually, even the paper source tray for the printer was a little worrysome; when I set the paper for standard 8.5" x 11", there seemed to be a great deal of room for movement, and I wonder if at some point this will cause jams. That was nice!There are two paper trays on the 845 and one on the 645. The paper tray accommodates up to 500 sheets, meaning fewer annoying beeps and out-of-paper messages to deal with. It's easy to pick up and carry if you need to reposition it.Dual paper trays is a nice touch. Its because of the dual paper trays which I happen to like. The paper tray is slightly difficult to adjust due to roughness in the tracks.Installation was a breeze, and I tested printing, copying, faxing, and scanning features within minutes of installation, by merely following on-screen instructions. Most likely the paper will fall apart before the images and text disappear, which puts this printer firmly in the cross hairs of a quality laser printer for a MUCH cheaper initial price. The 845 has a large paper capacity with two trays for a total of 500 sheets. With the paper trays extended and the document feeder flipped up, it measures 17.6" x 22.3" x 12.3". You can print ruled or graph paper with the click of a button. Inkjet paper, which is much better than the run-of-the-mill 20lb copy paper, but isn't the Epson-brand paper that's recommended. Other paper stocks will likely give different results.Compared to my other printers, two-sided printing is very fast. This allows you to put plain paper in one tray and letterhead (or blank checks) in the second.O
