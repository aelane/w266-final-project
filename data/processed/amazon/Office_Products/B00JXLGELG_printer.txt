This particular printer - the Epson WorkForce WF-7620 - is very big, very powerful, and yet another winner for Epson. Overall, this is a great printer for large projects as it prints up to 13&#8221; x 19&#8221; and scans up to 11&#8221; x 17&#8221;. I got this printer because I sometimes design color book covers and marketing brochures. This printer can do double sided printing, and it does it really well without chewing up the paper when it pulls it back in through the print feeder. Inside this printer where the ink is held there is a spot for an additional extra large black ink cartridge. Other than that, this printer does a great job of making beautiful poster sized pictures. It is a very large printer thus you will need a strong surface on which to sit this printer. The printer MUST sit firmly on a hard surface, as I quickly learned. The printer comes with a DVD which will direct you to an update download for the operation and drivers. If you have only this printer as a printer and you can go wireless I personally think that would be the way.I am not going to get into all the specs as you can read them on the product page however let me touch on a couple of features. The printer comes with very minimal paperwork.I think after "playing" around with the black and white resolution and the color resolution I can get the printer to working closer to laser quality however for now it is being used as just another printer. I'm just going to tell what the printer is made for, how it accomplishes this, and my impressions of its performance.The Epson  WF-7620 is manufactured to meet the requirements of the business community. I still like my old Canon printer better than most others I've seen. I will certainly recommend this printer to my photo hobbyist friends. Overall this is a very good printer, the ink is expensive but it claims it will last longer than normal (we will see). I would have thought with a printer this &#8220;large&#8221; they should support bigger ink cartridges. This printer is supposed to  not get paper jams and I'm counting on that, as it is a real time waster. I was so pleasantly surprised by this printer. First off, this printer is big. Like said before by many, this is the easiest printer I have ever set up. This is a VERY heavy printer that comes in a hefty box - plan accordingly for its arrival. The Epson WorkForce WF-7620 is a BIG printer for your home office or office. However, the printer drivers that I downloaded from the Epson website for both Windows and MacOS are terrible.The printer driver would pop up with an error message whenever I tried to print something from my Windows 8 PC or my Apple MacBook Air because the printer would get confused about which tray to use and what paper type was in each tray. I would have to walk over to the printer every time and press menu buttons on the printer to manually override the error message and get my project to print.Epson really needs to completely rework the printer drivers and make better ones available IMMEDIATELY.The print quality itself is fantastic and the large flatbed scanner and fax capabilities work perfectly. The Epson 7610/7620 are the exact same printer with one difference: paper capacity. The printer remained connected after the initial wi-fi setup.I tried scanning first to verify no damage occurred to the scanning assembly during shipping. If you are looking at this printer you likely need the wide-format capability. This Epson printer is fantastic!!! The printer was very easy to set up and get going. This printer seems pretty new, that should change. I am floored by this printer. My previous printer wasEpson WorkForce WF-3540 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer, Copier, Scanner, 2-Sided Duplex, ADF, Fax. AirPrint Compatible(that I still love, it just couldn't print/or scan as large as I needed like this printer can) I thought the WF-3540 was big, the WF-7620 is huge! I cannot imagine needing or wanting another printer for a very long time! Our printer prior to this was an Epson Workforce 845. Seriously, this printer has a huge footprint for a home printer (32&#34; x 22&#34; with paper feeder/trays fully open).Second impression: WOW! This printer is a winner!! I can&#8217;t help but think that if you just need a printer for basic printing that there are more economically friendly options out there. I got this printer as a replacement for my trusty Canon PIXMA PX350, which gave me faithful service for about 3 years. What drew me to this printer was that it was AirPrint compatible, which is something that I needed. It comes with the printer, A/C adapter, the drive CD, the user manuals, and the quick start guide.I was able to easily set this up for completely wireless printing on both my PC and my Mac. The printer comes with Epson iPrint Apps for iOS and Android, but if you have iOS devices, it supports AirPrint natively. This printer is one of the fastest multifunction printers I have seen. This is the largest printer I have ever owned. It won't even fit in the printer cabinet that every other printer has gone into. I put this printer in my husband's office. That said, this printer is a dream, great quality, durable and simply prints perfectly every time. When you first turn it on, the printer initializes and then tells you to install the ink. It also assigns your printer an email address so you can print things by emailing them. The printer did not come in an Epson printed box. Just select it from the printer properties inside whatever program you are printing from. We love this WorkForce WF-7620 printer. This is an excellent printer with many of the features of more expensive models. I think this is a really great all-in-one printer. Basically you just unpack the printer and remove all the tape that's keeping the printer nice and secure, plug the printer in and power on. This is very helpful to me because I'm able to put the printer in any room that I choose (including the basement as I do at times) and print from anywhere in the house. Before buying this printer you should seriously consider where you are going to put it, it is huge! The printer display stalled on the last digit of the year while on my monitor I was asked to print a page, I indicated yes, and that was the end of it. I've this printer defective out of the box and I have to repackage this huge and heavy machine and somehow get it to a FedEx facility which is miles away. I am primarily using this printer for my work related printing and my daughter's school projects - I am under-utilizing the potential, but tested each feature of the Printer.Print & Scan Quality ; Seriously this is second to none, I have had large format prints done in FedEx and I recently compared the results of a a print of Maps of Different Countries which my daughter had prepared and I could hardly tell the difference between FedEx and the one done at my home.Speed :  Really does not matter to me, but it is really fast compared to my Canon MP210 and HP All-In-One portable.Form factor :  This is very important since I live in a apartment - for all that it does, it does occupy a small space and I was able to place it on my L shaped tableCost of Operation:  Still have not used any cartridges, but given the fact that it has separate cartridges for each color - that alone should bring in some savings.Connectivity : AirPrint connectivity is what myself and my daughter use and it worked flawlessly without any setup.Fax :  Really - does anyone still use it ?Will update back on how long the cartridges last and any other issues I face.Right now - we are just loving this printer/scannerT
