Adding the printer to my wireless network could not have been easier. I entered it and then the printer was part of the network. It found the printer and it has options to print Photos, web page print, and even operate the scanner.I was interested in the scanner and put it through a few items. On my current printer I only use black. The printer came supplied with regular 125 cartridges not half starter cartridges, a nice touch from Epson. With this one, the printer responds within moments and prints rapidly with good quality.The fuss-less response of this printer has us almost completely bypassing our 3 year old HP 7200 series printer because we can assume the document is going to print (or scan!) I don't use this extensively as I have another black and white printer that I use for most printing jobs, but I have used this for scanning documents to the computer, and making quick copies. I have this printer installed in a bookcase and having the ability to pop up the control panel makes it so much easier to see than getting down on my knees to get the panel at eye level.I find it pretty intuitive to use and haven't had to refer to the owner's manual so far.The only complaint I have, and the reason for docking a star, is that the paper carrier is kind of flimsy. I originally had the printer sitting on a pedestal with a drawer in it where I kept the spare printer paper. I finally had to deinstall the printer, flip it over, remove 2 screws and flex the frame slightly to release the paper tray and reinstall it correctly. If your printer is just out of the box you may want to try printing a few photos to see how closely the colors match your original files.Bottomline: I will be using this printer mostly for documents which this unit prints just fine. This printer came with full size cartridges, btw.This printer is MUCH faster as well.Just out of the box here so I'll update if any issues arise. This is a reasonably nice printer, and at this price point, I would even say a very nice printer. Thus far no other printer I have used (and there are roughly a dozen) have required the installation of driver {at least not since windows xp, which auto-detects most printers and has drivers on board: plug & play). If I were buying or replacing a printer now, I would make this one my first choice. I have 1 printer (and early Canon Pixma) which is less expensive to use, but the print quality is not anywhere near as good.The only cons, or caveats: It is larger than many home printers. (I could not refer to a printer as "perfect" which sometimes produces illegible prints, and... This printer calls for very expensive ink, and the cartridges interact in such a way with the printer that when they register low, they will continue to register low and not work even if you try to re-fill them. Still, the printer recognizes the cartridge as a genuine Epson cartridge and says the ink level is at full and it printed fine for a little while. When I opened the printer, the cartridges would not move into a position where I could open the lid and remove them. I will probably replace this printer very soon, as I am not sure I can make it print reliably at an affordable price.Update:  It is now April 1, 2012. All the printer companies are working hard these days trying to sell you $15.00 cartridges when you only need to purchase 20 cents of worth of ink, but I really hate the Epson company and would never try them again.Update: April 6, 2012. I received the Epson Stylus NX530 printer today. It prints quite fast compared to the older printer we own. This is a nice little printer. It is a wifi printer and prints double sided. This printer really has almost everything you need (except Fax) for every day use. I highly recommend this printer to anyone who needs a printer at an amazing price. I would not recommend this printer for commercial use though. I need a printer that will stand up to all of the scanning and printing issues I will face.I was offered a review copy of the Epson Stylus NX530 Wireless Printer through the Amazon vine program. I'd been quite happy with my current printer - a HP Photosmart Premium - and I thought it would be good to compare them side by side and see how well the Epson held up.The setup of the Epson was QUITE easy. It seems like a quite fine printer for the typical home office user. What one printer lacks, the other one makes up for. This printer is unique, usually when I open a box of a printer; there are a slew of cables and the big brick of power supply. I was looking for an inexpensive Airprint capable printer when I saw this on sale at Amazon Goldbox Deal, fifty nine bucks, just too hard to resist.It took me only 5 minutes to set up (plus 5 minutes while the printer is charging ink, which you just leave it alone to finish what it needs to do). I was also impressed that for such a small printer, it can print double-sided without any manual help. This printer is a 5-star value within its category of inexpensive printers. I am using this printer for limited home use - printing out the kids papers for school and things like that. This is a fast printer. I would do this even if the printer had a fax built in. We decided to give this printer a try because of its ease of use, scanning capability and the fact that it could be wirelessly connected to a number of computers in our house. This is not the printer for photos.

The Epson NX530 printer offers a lot of bang for the buck.

Even though this is an affordable printer, the cost savings isn't worth the trouble that comes with it.

If the printer is barely bumped it falls out.
