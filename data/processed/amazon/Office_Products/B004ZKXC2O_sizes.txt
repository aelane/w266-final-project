Different sizes of sticky notes all in one pad. With five sizes on one pad...and bright colors as well....you will have a size to fit every need.When you need a size, just lift the others and remove the size you need. I love that there are five different sizes, all together, and you can utilize the pad of Post-Its like a regular note pad with ease in tearing off the individual Post-Its without completely destroying the binding.Great bright colors and useful sizes of each color - great idea Avery! I have found having multiple sizes available to be useful, depending on how much I had to write. This is unique because it is many different sizes in one pad. There are five sizes to choose from, the first being a regular sized Post-It size, then there are four more levels, each about a half inch larger than the last size. I use all different sizes of post-its for various projects (personal and professional) all the time. I've had to improvise when I travel to have the sizes I need, which usually means toting around various sizes in a plastic bag. But, having all of the different sizes on top of each other in a single pad doesn't actually work very well. We just ended up separating the various sizes into their own little pads and then they work great. It is handy to have the sizes all in one. With five sizes and five colors at your fingertips, it's easy to systematize your sticky-ing or make it more bright and cheerful.Even though Avery is not the most popular brand, I find their sticky notes to work as well as any other. They are bright and colorful and come in different sizes and all bound together so you don't have a dozen little post-it packs on your desk. I'm not sure it's possible, but here's what I do know.There are five sizes of paper, each size with a specific color, and all bound under the same hard plastic binding. I realize now that having those two sizes is what works best for me. This makes accessing different sizes and colors of stickies hassle free.There's really not much more to it than that! Where else can you find five sizes of sticky notes grouped together in a neat, useful bunch? Now I have different sizes for different uses. With individual sizes, chances are you are using a size that's "close enough," but with this pack you may realize that a closer size may make more sense than you thought.

The five different sizes are on the pad in a stair-step/tier style.

These are also in several sizes which I love because it gives me plenty of room to write what I need.
