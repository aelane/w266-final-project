This paper trimmer is a great tool that delivers what it claims. There is a paper clamp to prevent smudging. I ordered this Fiskars paper cutter to use in my office and to cut coupons, etc. The Fiskars Recylced Bypass Trimmer is a lightweight paper cutter that cuts efficiently and effectively. I  found this paper cutter to be great. I needed a paper cutter so bad because I am an extreme couponer and got tired of using scissors to clip multiple newspaper inserts! This paper trimmer has come to the rescue. I don't recommend purchasing this paper trimmer if your are wanting to cut more that eight sheets of paper at once. The clear paper holder probably isn't necessary, but it helps to hold the sheets in place while you cut. It also keeps the paper tight for that perfect cut and if your stack of papers won't fit under the guide, you have too many. The clear plastic paper guide is a nice feature for most jobs... but can be easily removed if needed. This is a very light weight paper cutter - a bit less stable than I'd like. This is a sturdy, well-made paper cutter. BUT you must press down on the clear plastic paper holder when lowering the blade... or the blade will drag the pages somewhat. - would not recommend any paper cutter without supervision)The blade does not fall down as it does with heavy duty cutters.

I really like the "clear paper clamp/smudge guard" which is a piece of plastic that is attached to the deck of the cutter near the cutting edge.

It can be removed if you find the paper you are cutting is too thick or bulky to slide under the plastic--except that is what I did many years ago and I ended up with the cut finger--so do this at your own risk!3.

I'm a paper crafter so this type of product is something I can get a lot of good use out of.
