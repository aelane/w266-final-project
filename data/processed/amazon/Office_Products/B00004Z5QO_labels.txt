I've been using their labels for more than 20 years -- they are SO easy to use on the computer, and these 08167 labels print equally well on my Ink Jet AND laser printer.Feeding them through a copier is a cinch too.These 08167 labels peel easily, the ink impressions are sharp and crisp, in color OR black and white.I have had no problem with the Avery labels' adhesive longevity in the past -- let's see how well these 08167's do -- I would think that they will be just as good as their predecessors. Great labels. The labels I printed on my inkjet printer were very clear and the colors looked great. Love these labels; even though I confess I did use a Laser printer (these are made for Ink Jets), printing was a SNAP!I visited the Avery site, downloaded the Microsoft Word version of Template #5167 and had my business return labels printed within 10 minutes (will be a LOT quicker in the future, now that I've got the template saved to my hard drive). I absolutely love these mailing labels! The labels adhere well. I'd rather use the pre-printed friendly, cheerful, colorful labels that I receive from charitable orgs. This little labels are really nice. Avery labels are simply the best and the downloadable templates help those who don't have one in their word processing application. I love Avery labels! The labels print flawlessly every time. I was worried that these labels might peel off in my printer and jam it up. I have had Avery labels on the shelf for years that still work well. Avery apparently knows labels very well and the label business. The labels are smaller than I am used to using, however our address printed clearly and completely with no problems. I found the labels also nice to stick inside books I loan out, recipe cards and I carry a few in my purse. My Avery labels ride all the way to their destination. These labels are designed for inkjet printers often found on desktops. Avery labels are reliable and all you need to do is follow instructions, using the template for these sheets with your office/wordprocessing software. I have been using all of their printable labels for years and years now. These labels printed out well and I had no smearing when I applied them to my mailing envelopes. I love these labels! These Avery Easy Peel Return Address labels worked perfectly for me. The labels peel off very easily and as advertised they do NOT smear which was something I had wondered about.I honestly can't see why I would need anything else. This leaves the labels as free-standing units on the carrier sheet.For anyone who has ever had to put labels on a number of letters, this saves substantial time and mess. I design labels for my classroom library books and don't want to worry that the labels will smudge or begin to peel off after a while. One may think that these labels are not needed, that you can just jot down your return address when mailing items. I used these labels to print some return address labels. As with most labels, you can get away with running the sheet through to print only a few labels and then rerunning a partial sheet for a second print of the remaining labels. The labels hold the ink without smearing or blurring or bleeding. Furthermore, no labels detached from the sheet while moving through the printer - a disaster which has happened to me using lower quality labels. Using Avery's "Design and Print Online" you most certainly can create 4-line labels as follows: Find and start "Design and Print Online" on Avery's website. I received these Return Address labels shortly after I joined the Vine Review program. Unlike other labels, I didn't have to struggle and swear while peeling them off the page to place on an envelope. With the Avery labels, I have total control over the way my return address label looks.As usual, with Avery you get quality labels that are reasonably price, come in a great arrangement, and have a strong adhesive on them. If you need labels, these are the best! These labels are too small for return address'. These are the perfect labels for what they're intended for: return addresses. The labels are easy to peel off the sheet as well.Before purchasing, check the dimensions of the labels. These labels are of great quality. It might seem silly to be excited about labels but I am. I've been looking for labels that aren't a pain in the you-know-what and I've found them.These labels are return address label sized (80/sheet). I'll be ordering these again but with 80 labels per sheet, it may be a while. These labels are a godsend for labeling and mailing things. 2000 labels per package are just waiting for you! While address labels may not be the most interesting thing I buy, getting good labels that are easy to print does matter to me. With Avery's labels the hard work is done for you and your labels will look perfect first time.
