Only problem is: it doesn't. The problem, of course, is that the non-sticky part of the note will, sooner or later, start to curl, making it easy to accidentally peel the label off the item without noticing. Post-it Super Sticky Removable Label Pads solve the problem by making a note that's 95% sticky with a non-sticky part (to pull the labels off the pad) that's perforated so you remove it entirely before putting the label where you want it. I have a problem with original Post-Its coming lose in reference books where I am flipping back and forth. That's not a problem as such, just pointing out how they're constructed.The colors in the package I got were rather bright. This completely solves the problem of the mystery bin or box sitting on the shelf. The problem is that they are not aligned, and the edge comes out looking messy.The design of these labels could be much better, as in leaving one corner without stick, and a dot on the back side so you could tell which corner it was.With the design as it is, your fingers smudge the sticky back as you try to get the perforated section off. The problem is that I often riffle through the boxes and containers and take some things out - only to replace them with things that are not on the label. I also had not problem removing the labels - but there's a catch -The labels have a little dotted line on one end to indicate where to pull off the pad and presumably where to pull off the label from the box.

I'm not sure what the problem was -- humidity, maybe?Anyway, I'll keep using these in my pantry, but I'm not sure I'll use them for anything else.

You know the problem:  you have something - a jar, a box, a bottle - that you want to label for a finite period.

The problem is, the sticky part is a thin band, and the rest of the label - flopping in the breeze as it were - reduced the life-expectancy of the label to a matter of minutes.Post-It Super Sticky removable labels are a good solution to this problem.
