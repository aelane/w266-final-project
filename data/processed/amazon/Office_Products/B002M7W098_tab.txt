I think it might be better to get a different colored tab as it would show up on book pages better (my primary use.) If you peel this tab off and reuse it, the clear section will be very foggy and reading through it will be difficult or impossible.I used these in my numeric files. What could be handier than being able to stick on a numbered tab, then be able to remove or move it whenever you wanted. The tab containing the number is white, but the part that sticks on the edge of the paper is clear. If you place the tab on the left page of an open book, you can't see the number when the book is closed (unless face down). You can write on the white numbered tab portion as well as on the gray matte sticky portion whichwon't be visible if you are using it in a book or file -- I was thinking a good use for me would be in a scrapbook, and alsoperhaps to count/mark off recipes for a thanksgiving or other elaborate meal where the numbering would come in handy to sequence.On second thoughts, I will stick to my  color coded post it tabs for that, (red for entrees, blue for desserts etc.) You can write on the tab and the clear sticky part. I repositioned one tab many times to see how long it would hold up and I was impressed. Each tab has a 1 inch X 2 inch frosted, colorless rectangular plastic, with a white-colored flap connected to one edge.

I put one tab at the beginning of the section for each class.

They provide a clean, easy to use tab that is removable like a post-it note, and which has a translucent writable surface on the page itself to jot down a few short notes.

This would keep me from purchasing these, as I would like the tab to be adhered to the page of interest - which might very well be the left page in a book - whether due to a chapter beginning there, or a recipe, hike or whatever being on that page.
