The gel wrist pad is firm enough for support, but not hard. This gel wrist rest for a full-sized computer keyboard goes with this product:3M Gel Mouse Pad with Wrist Rest, Nonskid Plastic Base, 6-3/4 x 9-1/8, Daisy Design. I really like this gel wrist rest. I had been using the wrist rest that came with myFellowes Keyboard Drawer (CRC91403)and after awhile it became uncomfortable to use. This gel wrist rest is so much better on my wrists, PLUS its bright and colorful and cheerful! The wrist rest is excellent and I would recommend it. Besides that, I was happy with the wrist rest itself, in terms of function. However, this is the first wrist rest I have ever owned for my computer keyboard; I have always been skeptical that one would help my typing. Now, I'm wondering how I ever typed without a wrist rest.The gel-filled wrist rest has a smooth surface that is very cool to the touch; it makes typing very comfortable. This gel wrist pad is great! This wrist pad has such a nice feel to it. This is a brightly colored wrist rest that serves its purpose. I desperately needed a wrist rest for my keyboard. The Gel of the wrist rest gives good support, but has give in it to allow your wrists to rest comfortably. This is a great wrist rest. I am loving this wrist rest. Later I found her with the wrist rest and she was trying to bite it. I always us a wrist rest when I keyboard or my wrists end up getting sore. But after using this wrist rest for a few days I am in love. Overall, nice wrist rest, reccomended! This wrist rest features a sweet, pink and daisy flower design perfect for kids,teens and adults alike. This wrist rest is comfortable and the backing is made of a great, non-skid plastic. There is also a MATCHING wrist rest/mouse gel pad. Compared to some of the more popular wrist rests, with their neoprene or synthetic cloth over the gel (striking me as repurposing unsold wetsuits), this seems a little better, in that it remains smooth, and there is no cloth to come loose from the underlying gel, no potential for puckered or loose cloth on a well-used rest. I am really impressed with this wrist rest. I've always eyed wrist rests in the stores and thought they'd be a comfort, but I was never bold enough to purchase one. A wrist rest is a must-have for me, so it's  nice to be able to have a nice design to something that you're going to have to look at every day. This gel wrist pad doesn't lose it's padding and become indented from leaving your wrists resting on it.
