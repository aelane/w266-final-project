This will work handily to organize a project at your desk, and it will serve to archive them well after it is done.Negatives:  It is cardboard. If you have a prolonged project, or if you plan on using this for multiple projects, it may not wear well. The project 10 tabs are large and sturdy as well. This project organizer is sturdy and durable despite it being made from card stock.It's designed for business use, but it's great for hobby and craft use too. I can open it, see the project and the overview and know exactly what I am doing.For the price... Amazing. This would be great to organize a particular project (one phase of a house remodel, or one class) with ten pockets for notes and rec'ts. This project folder easily organizes paperwork for quick access. However, when I saw it, I realized it was perfect for me to carry to my project meetings, allowing me to leave heavy project binders behind. If you have a project that you are visiting less often and just need to keep organized than this would fit the bill.Other:  I wish the organizer had 12 sections so that it could be used for a year-long project, etc. For a project with a big amount of paperwork, you might still consider an accordian file with closure but this is a nice alternative for smaller paper projects. I used this project folder to organize a photography class I'm teaching -- a pocket for each lesson, plus one pocket for class roster, etc... In a project that will require many steps and much paper, this is a great tool to keep everything organized. This project folder makes it easy for me to keep track of various projects, their state of completion, and even their sales.Ten generous size sections allow a section for each project! I highly recommend this for any project! So I was very happy to get and start to use this project organizer.WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT:a) It's a very tasteful medium royal blue (not navy). It promises to "Easily organize project paperwork," but for the first week, every time I looked at it, my mind went totally blank.
