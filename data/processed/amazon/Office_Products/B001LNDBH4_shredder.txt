I had an older shredder that just did strips. This shredder does what it says: it will shred 12 pages a time under light use, that is no more than 20 seconds of continuous shredding.I regret, though, that I let this unit sit for weeks before getting around to using it. This is my third Royal shredder, and I will probably stay with the brand I bought this to replace an aging shredder I purchased almost 9 years ago. My old shredder couldn't handle many pages at once and couldn't shred credit cards or CDs/DVDs. Not only that, I HATED that I had to remove the heavy top shredder part to empty the waste basket. I refused to buy another shredder like that and my uncle had one with the pullout waste basket with a small window to see if it was getting full, so I immediately started searching for one like that. This shredder had all of the features I wanted and has been working great during the few months we've had it. I'm extremely pleased with this shredder and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't need a smaller shred than this unit provides. The heavy shredder arrived well packaged and no damage. My old shredder head had to be lifted off basket and placed carefully to avoid damage and messy paper getting all over the place. However if a good shredder is what you are looking for, try this one. My last shredder was a Royal so I decided to try another one after it played out. My last Royal shredder was purchased from Walmart and covered by Square Trade for the same amount and when it became inoperable, I was sent a pre-paid return label and given a full refund.
