This is my third Canon printer, first laser. Setting up the printer to be used wirelessly is not easy, but doable. Once accomplished, however, my printer would not print. So far, the printer works well. Overall, I am happy with the printer and have gotten over the frustration of not being able to get it to print over the course of a long weekend. I am sorry that I purchased this printer and would definitely not give it more than two stars. This is my own personal printer in my office, and after a year, I do love it because it never jams, loads paper very easily, and responds immediately to printer controls, whether from a Word document or from the internet. The printer's limited warranty is for one year; registration can be done on the Canon website. A very nice All in One printer that is fast and does a great job. The printer also has a walk through anytime you get a jam or some other error. Once I had it connected--or rather, the printer said it had connected, then I had to install the drivers from the CD. This is a nice printer. This is not the fastest printer in the world, but at this price, you really cannot beat it.This is my second Canon Laser printer. This is my 3rd Canon Laser printer (last one got fried by a lightening strike).
