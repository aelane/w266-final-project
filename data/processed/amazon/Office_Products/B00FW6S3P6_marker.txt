The marker is easy to erase and writes cleanly. It's better than no marker, but it's not worth replacing it with one just like it.Overall, this is a great cubicle/desk message board or a fridge board. Only comes with a black marker, which works for some. The marker is tiny, though at least it does have an eraser. It shows the marker colors brightly, is easy to erase, and the markers write clearly on it. The included marker is black and attaches to the top via a clip. The marker includes and eraser. The marker does not write very well, but I had other dry erase markers available and they worked better, so it is not a problem with the board. But, the marker writes clearly & erases cleanly. The included marker is the perfect size for writing quick notes and has an attached eraser.Overall, I like this a lot and it is a great addition to the kitchen, but I do have two complaints: the mounting magnets are too weak, it doesn't want to stay on the fridge, it sort of slowly slides down the face of it; and, the magnets for holding notes and things are glued to the board and it is almost impossible to get all of the glue off. But it works great.We've been using this steadily since it arrived, and it's hard to imagine how we got along without it before.The included marker with eraser works really well.I'm not exactly sure what the purpose of the two magnets is, but the board itself and the marker and the eraser attached to the marker make it easy to leave notes, make lists, etc.The only drawback to this product is the PERMANENT mounting adhesive included with it. Lastly, the marker started drying out within a week of using it and yes, we did put the cap on it every time so we had to buy a set of markers and leave them in a cup next to the board.

Also the marker was completely dried out.

It does stay if the marker and clip and magnets are all off, but just barely.

The marker is easy to use and the surface is smooth.
