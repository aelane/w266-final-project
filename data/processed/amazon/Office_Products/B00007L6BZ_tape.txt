The tape was easy to unwind and cut in the better than average plastic tape dispenser. I've used Scotch packing tape products before, but never a dispenser for this size roll. I use this tape (and other Scotch products) regularly for my shipping needs. This tape is very strong and durable. Once the tape splits on the roll it's almost impossible to get it started as one piece of tape like it's supposed to be.This is tough for packing needs and comes in a nice sized roll that will last. The tape is a little thicker and it's very sticky for taping down cardboard or adding extra security to bubble wraps or other types of packaging. This tape is my new preference when it comes to packing parcels and shipping out items. I am confindant that this tape will not come undone and will keep my packages secure through all the tough treatment that packages get when you send them. I know it's odd to have a "favorite" tape, but when it comes to sealing boxes I can be a bit OCD. This tape is strong, thick, and seems durable. Good tape, does what it's supposed to, bad dispenser.This tape is way better than a lot of the clear packaging tape that I've used. This tape is also crystal clear, so no problems taping over address labels without obscuring the writing.Also works great to remove cat hair from suits! VINE must have used this tape to package it, because I could not remove the bubble wrap from around it without my using all my super strength, tearing the bubble wrap, to the distress of all of my friends who love to sit around popping bubble wrap.Made in the USA (gosh, we make something besides guns? 'Pull tape through the' (rest illegible and/or covered by VINE sticker - I shall never know - through the what? 'Could this indicate that while the tape itself, twenty times stronger as it is than acrylic tape, is made within the USA (and territories? Also the tape itself is entitled: Scotch Shipping Packaging Tape.Now, we all know the hard way how much the Scots insist on being called Scots, and not Scotch, despite the 1890 Glenlivet Scotch Whisky Distillery Peat Worm Tube and the rest. This tape sticks and once it is down it won't come off unless you really force it to. I would recommend this tape to anyone who does a lot of shipping and requires a strong sticky tape. This tape does the basic job of sealing and holding packages together, and goes beyond that by being exceptionally strong and very transparent (the 38 yards of tape are wound onto a spool that is 3/8" thick with tape, which I calculate to comprise roughly 115 layers, and one can read the label underneath all those layers almost as if the tape were not there). The tape is sticky enough and highly unlikely to slip.This tape unspools easily enough, and the dispenser includes an effective cutting edge; but this tape is engineered for strength and does not have the "quiet" feature of another Scotch packaging tape that 3M makes. You should buy whichever tape more nearly suits your needs--this tape for strength, the other for ease and quietness of unspooling.The only thing I can think of that might make the product better would be to provide a convenient surface on which to park the leading edge of the remaining tape so that it does not flop around and re-adhere to itself--sometimes getting tape "started" (i.e. Using the off-brand tape was actually a horrible experience, and I vowed never to turn my back on Scotch again.I'm not sure that one would need the great strength and thickness of the heavy duty tape on all packages, but that's a question you'll have to ask yourself. Otherwise the tape is great and its plastic dispenser works well.-- Debra Hamel This tape is so strong I have set it aside to use for moving boxes, and I plan to buy more of it when we pack everything up. This also means they can't include much tape since your hand has to fit around the entire piece. The tape was suitably sticky to seal my box but when I cut the tape with the serrated edge it would snap back onto the roll every time which means I have to go back and use my fingernails to peal it back off the roll. The tape, once stuck together on the roll was almost impossible to get separated, it would tear in several places etc. However, when you consider that there is no wasted tape when you try to peal it from the roll, the wasted time and the ease of use makes this a much better bargain, at least for me. This tape sticks to the box, it is strong so you don't need to use much, and it does the job. Do not try using this tape without it, your tape will get stuck to everything. Overall, this is an easy tape to use and it has plenty of sticking power to keep boxes shut. How do I review tape? I got this tape today and could not wait to try it out, even though I didn't have a package to pack and ship at the moment. The tape is just under two inches wide so it's great for not only taping up boxes but also placing over mailing labels because it's clear and weather proof. For those of us who use shipping tape, one of the great challenges is how to get the entire roll spinning at once, without having to break nails and play with the tape because it is not coming off the roll evenly. I also like that the tape cuts off well- not like some of the cheaper tapes that stretch and where one has to work to get the cutter to do its job. This is my go-to tape for jobs where it is important that the tape holds up. This tape is the one to turn to when you need a tape to count on! The tape is wide enough to make me feel itis secure in closing packages  for shipping. This tape really is strong, reliable, thick, and doesn't get stuck on itself or stick back to the roll. It's my favorite tape when I'm trying to close a cardboard box for shipping or packing. Great tape, good dispenser. This tape is about as good as it gets... nice quality, plenty sticky, not too thin, etc. What I like more is a good tape gun (like this one, which I use and love:3M Scotch Gray Box Sealing Tape Dispenser (H180)). Then you can just buy tape refills (like these ones:Scotch Mailing and Storage Tape 3650-4, 1.88 Inches x 54.6 Yards, 4-Pack), and save a little money that way. Strong, reliable and easy to apply, this tape keeps the boxes closed. It always cuts evenly, so I don't waste tape, and it doesn't split. This is good tape! I've used other clear tape products in the past, some good, and some not good at all. This tape feels strong and when I taped up a box, it held really well. Packing tape is about as interesting as, well, staples for your stapler? Plus, since my current tape isn't as aggressive as I'd like so I have to massage the box where the tape is laid down to be certain it adheres. This is my new tape and I recommend it without reservation. Like packing tape. This tape doesn't have that problem. The tape is fairly heavy duty (thickness), and it seems of good quality. To start the tape I had to struggle with the tape to get is started and lost a lot of tape in the beginning because it would not start properly and only half the tape came off. Then I had to struggle to keep the tape flowing as I taped a box together. All in all I would not buy this tape dispenser again. It's hard to get excited about packing tape, but this was a nice product. The tape is very strong, it's clear which I prefer to the brown tape, and the dispenser is a huge help. The tape held the box together even when the box was tossed around and dropped. I would definitely buy this tape for heavy duty jobs. The tape cuts easily, and the dispenser is easy to use. While it's very good tape, I'm not convinced that it's worth the extra money, and would likely purchase a cheaper product in the future. You have seen the smaller Scotch Packaging tape dispensers? )The tape dispenser is a nice touch but I eventually took the roll out because I have become so accustomed to using tape without a dispenser. The tape is heavy duty, for sure. The tape doesn't get stuck; it doesn't get "lost" so you have to find the separation point; the cutter is sharp and works easily; the tape is strong and doesn't get stringy; the ergonomics feel solid and easy to grip. Reinforced tape for packaging in a handy dispenser. This Scotch Super Strength tape is good stuff. The tape stays put and seals fast and easy. I don't expect this tape to fail.First, the negative: it's a bit of a pain in the neck to start a new roll. Lifting the tape was tough, even with fingernails. It's good at helping you cut the tape, but imperfect for keeping tape ready for the next unroll: it has a tendency to roll backwards and stick back to the main roll, and it holds the tape in a way where it can get stuck to other things if the roll is thrown into a drawer or something. This tape is pleasingly thick and easier to use than the cheap stuff. We found the tape to be more resistant to puncture and stretching...but the adhesive was only a bit stronger and so, would still release from a stressed carton...so, while this tape is better for packaging heavier items...the adhesive cannot be made 20 times stronger or the tape would be rather difficult to work with...much stronger tape with only a bit stronger adhesive may not be worth too much more than regular tape...save it for special packing needs when every precaution is warranted. Right now this tape is taping a cardboard box to the outside wall, where we're going to put in a bay window (so we can see what the space will feel like), it's keeping some mounting screws attached to shelves while they are in storage (so we don't lose them), and it makes a pretty good impromptu handle - just wrap it around something with a little slack at the top, and fold the slack in half.The tape has a thousand uses. I'd rather use this tape with a quality dispenser, so... recommended withreservations. This is super strong tape and easy to work with. It's pretty hard to review packing tape. With packing tape, there are potentially many negative things to say and nothing really positive to say, as long as it works. This tape works great, and I happily recommend it. Granted it's difficult to wax lyrical about packing tape. I tend to use tape like this for mailing, so it is nice to have a thicker tape. This makes the tape an annoying mess as you try to get the tape to be one piece again. This tape doesn't do that at all. It's more expensive, but I would have to debate all the tape I've ruined trying to get all the teeth torn pieces into one piece again as an expense as well. I would consider buying this tape as an alternative.

That seems high to me, and since I can buy great tape for half the price, I can't give it a full 5 stars.However, if you are not concerned about price, this product fits the bill in every other way.

Using this tape for those small packages is akin to using a flame thrower to light your barbecue.

Nice big tape, and the dispenser is easy to use.
