Perhaps the ink will be expensive, but for all this for a mere $99.99 leaves a lot left over to pay for ink. Install the ink cartridges was easy enough, but after installation, it takes another 6 minutes to "clean". The Canon MG5420 comes with 5 separate ink cartridges, with the cartridges in XL (extra large) size. If you need to change an ink tank, expect it to be at least a 5 minute process. But in general, Canon does seem to have about the same ink usage as the other leading brands.- One good thing about most recently manufactured printers (including this one) is that they have separate cartridges for the individual hues - Magenta, Cyan, and Yellow - rather than just one big color cartridge. The ritual for unpacking and installing the ink tanks (etc) was straightforward and took about 30 minutes. The Pixma MG5420 comes with set-up ink cartridges which don't have as much ink as Canon's regular cartridges. So, you might as well purchase some ink cartridges to have on hand when the ink runs out. The ink isn't too expensive (and there aren't EIGHT of them!!) which makes it reasonable to replace the ink,not the entire printer, filling our landfills. Actual ink usage is high enough that this bug is pretty unwelcome. This might make you feel a little better about ink usage in the model family 5000/6000 after reading the ink comments for the 6220.NOTE #3:  Just an informative, probably not very useful factoid :). This is much less ink than with the big cleaning/purging routine that is much rarer if you set the printer not to auto shut-off.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------INK USAGE CANON DATASHEET:------------------------------As it is pretty difficult to find, here below is Canon's published Page Yield per Document numbers (I rounded a little) for MG5420.I'm not sure how much of the difference between these numbers and users experience is due to the cleaning routine, difference between test and real world usage, etc.Here at least you can see real world expected usage ratio between standard and XL cartridges and compare to costs to determine the better value.----------Mixed Text/Graphics, A4/Letter, Plain Paper, Adobe Reader 10ISO/IEC24711 Test Method, ISO/IEC24712 Test Pattern:PGI-250 __ 300 pagesCLI-251 BK 1800CLI-251 C_ 330CLI-251 M_ 320CLI-251 Y_ 340PGI-250 XL __ 500 pagesCLI-251 XL BK 5500CLI-251 XL C_ 700CLI-251 XL M_ 680CLI-251 XL Y_ 700----------Color Photos, 4"x6":PGI-250 __ 2400 pagesCLI-251 BK 380CLI-251 C_ 120CLI-251 M_ 130CLI-251 Y_ 130PGI-250 XL __ 5600 pagesCLI-251 XL BK 1130CLI-251 XL C_ 260CLI-251 XL M_ 310CLI-251 XL Y_ 270----------vs. MG5520:------------Here are some of the more notable differences in MG5420's favor:MG5420:- Print Color Resolution: 9600 horizontal x 2400 vertical dpi- Print Most Granular Dot: 1 picoliter- Scanner Resolution: 2400 horizontal x 4800 vertical dpi (optical)- Print 4"x6" Photo speed: 21 seconds- Copy speed (FCOT): 14 seconds- Printing on DVD/CD'sMG5520:- Print Color Resolution: 4800 horizontal x 1200 vertical dpi*- Print Most Granular Dot: 2 picoliter- Scanner Resolution: 1200 horizontal x 2400 vertical dpi (optical)**- Print 4"x6" Photo speed: 44 seconds (110% slower)- Copy speed (FCOT): 20 seconds (40% slower)- No printing on DVD/CD's*The MG5520's 4800 horizontal x 2400 vertical max dpi COLOR PRINTING will meet MOST NEEDS. Also note that ink usage in inkjets can vary widely depending on settings and what you are printing. I have found that discounted ink works in this as well, so that's a plus! One is the extended ink (XL) and the other the normal ink (None XL) one may purchase. I have the normal ink, none XL and will keep an eye on how long it lasts.
