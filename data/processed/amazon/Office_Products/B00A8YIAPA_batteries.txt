It takes 4 AA batteries, which are not included. But the batteries are easy to put in and once they are in, the sharpener works extremely well. It takes four AA batteries and this seems to last for a while... So I ended up taking the batteries out and just using it as a manual sharpener. I thought 4-AA batteries a bit excessive at first but when I saw how well it sharpened my objections faded away. It uses batteries (4xAA) which will of course die at some point, but offsetting this consumability is its obvious portability. You will have to furnish the batteries since they don't come with the sharpener.Put this sharpener anywhere on your desk, or even take it with you! It requires 4 AA batteries, not included.We sharpened many pencils when we first received this item, it's always fun to try them out. It is cordless and needs 4 AA batteries (not included). It would be nice if batteries were included just in case the recipient does not have AA batteries on hand. I would have liked to have the batteries but also have a cord that could be attached/detached as needed.

However, I was thrilled to see that it works with rechargeable batteries, which we try to use most of the time.

The only 'negative' I can give it, is that it requires 4 AA batteries.

You need to purchase 2 AA batteries.
