I can't tell you how many binders I have picked up over the years that lack pockets on the inside. I buy such binders six or so at a time. I ordered these binders to keep class notes and materials organized, and the binders are perfect. I've tried the Wilson Jones Ultra-Duty 3-ring binders, and those were a step above these basic binders.Drawbacks:*Hinges not reinforced; susceptible to tear after repeated use. These are perfect sized binders for storing an assortment of papers I use for my research. Functionally, both binders will do the job just fine. Assuming that you haven't discovered D-ring binders yet and still actually want round-ring binders, this one may handle the task. The D-Ring binders have all the same features except the rings are shaped like the letter "D" and the edges along the spine are "knitted" and more durable. I've used many three ring binders in my life and this is by far the cheapest in quality of any I've ever used. When you look at three ring binders, for example, you wouldn't think there would be much difference beyond size. We'll stick with more reasonably priced binders. I have bought many of these binders and keep returning for more because they are such a good quality.For the larger binders, I have grown to love the &#34;D&#34; rings...so easy to open and I love the fact that the binder opens wide and flat!

I've used these binders for work, school, and personal use and have never had a problem with them.

The only negative is that these binders are a bit expensive.

There not at all different from most binders available at retail stores that sell for about a half to a quarter of the price that they are sold for here at Amazon.
