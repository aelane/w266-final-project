I picked these markers up because some Quartet products I bought came with weak, watery little markers. I'm so happy that these markers do not stink! These markers certainly fit the bill--they write easily (and the clear barrel shows you how much ink is left), erase easily, have no smell at all (unless you hold it RIGHT UP to your nose), and the funky-shaped cap isn't intrusive, but keeps the marker from rolling away. The markers have a very similar physical size as the Quartet Chisel Tip markers. I can't tell the markers apart unless I remove the cap, which reveals the Bullet Tip instead of the Chisel Tip. And the clean up is always easy!These markers write smoothly and the colors are consistent, unlike some others that make inconsistent thicknesses.Here is a major win for these: The tips can't get smashed into the body! Upon using the markers on my white board at school, I found that if the ink sat on the board- even for only 15 or so minutes- it was difficult to erase completely. These markers are durable and erase with ease. I got these erasable markers to go with a new wipe-off calendar that came with only one black marker. I must admit I prefer my markers that snap together into one long "stick" to these that have odd-shaped ends that don't connect. These markers write clearly, erase well and virtually odor-free, if that ever bothered you. If your previous markers have failed you, give this Quartet a try. No more empty markers left around! Try these markers, and I think you'll like them! These markers are probably the best ones I've owned. Aside from the red, these markers don't take extra work. I like these markers. I ordered these markers to use in my classroom every day as a teacher. These markers would not be my first choice, however, they do the job they were meant to accomplish. To see how these Quartet markers would perform, we did a little experiment. The longer I use these markers, the more I love them. I got these markers from the Amazon Vine program to review. The markers are very bright in color and write nice solid lines. Not only do these markers write nicely on the dry erase board, their odor is not nearly as cloying as those typically available--and that is worth the search, in my estimation. I needed Dry-Erase markers so when I had the opportunity to select some to try out, I jumped at chance and I honestly don't think I'll ever get another brand now that I've tried ACCO Brands dry-erase markers.There's barely any odor. These markers are fantastic! She loses markers constantly, but brought these home with her when school ended for the year.The best feature is the visible ink levels. these are very nice markers. So I got these markers for her too.They write smoothly and consistently and erase off the whiteboard cleanly and easily.Of course, it's important that they are nontoxic.The colors are bright.My granddaughtger is having a good time with them.No negatives.

I've been trying these markers out in my class this quarter, and the students I both agree that these are a huge step up.

* The markers glide more smoothly than any others I've tried -- it's like they have more of a wet feel than most dry erase markers -- but they don't smear easily, either.

Compared to markers of other brands, the Quartet marker's are great.
