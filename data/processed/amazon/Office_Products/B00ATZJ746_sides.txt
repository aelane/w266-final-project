To be honest, I didn't realize that they are as unique as they are when I ordered them... they are not the Open-On-Three sides folders I am used to - they open on just two sides, meaning that papers don't fall out as easily. Two of the sides are also closed, so it helps keep the contents inside the folder as opposed to spilled all over the floor.These are VERY sturdy! These are closed on two sides, so they have the ability to be filed in landscape like a typical file folder or in portrait mode. They are completely open on two sides - the top and one side. I also like that they are closed up on two sides as opposed to the regular traditional style where they are only connected on one side; that make your papers more secure. I do like that they are enclosed on two sides, making it much less easy for papers to drop out when removing them from a file cabinet. They are closed on two sides and have dual tabs for labels. Since they are closed on two sides, documents are better protected, and you won't find sheets slipping out in a helter-skelter mess when you're working quickly. These are closed on two sides so that you can actually hold them in the same position most of your papers are written without worrying about your papers falling out.The folders are about the same density of a standard manila file folder, but with a glossy exterior. They're closed on two sides to safely trap the contents; you can write or put a sticker on one or both of the tabs that go in each direction. They are enclosed on the two sides opposite the tabs, making them comparatively secure even for small papers such as receipts.There is a slight scoring across the front surface so that a 3 1/4" flap can be folded to leave the top of the papers exposed when used vertically or to secure smaller items when used horizontally. They're closed on two sides so work doesn't fall out, but they're open on two sides so that I can very easily peek in and take work out, too. With only two sides open this is a great file for desktop reference sheets (or handouts). Most importantly, since they are closed on two sides I find the need to take the papers out of the folders to review them.
