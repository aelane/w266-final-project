I have another printer I will use for my reg printing, but the scanning and copy machine are a great added bonus to something for less then $65, and its scans very well!! This is a great printer, for pictures as well as your daily needs, like printing a recipe or an article. I use this printer for occassional photo printing, not sure if it's a good idea to use this as your exclusive photo printer because of the expense of the ink. We haven't used this printer much yet, so I can not attest to it's long term reliability or performance. This is a very nice printer for low volume work. This is the third Canon Pixma printer we have owned. If you already have a printer, you know that the manufacturers are using the Gillette razor model; pricing the printers low, and gauging on the ink. On our new printer, the MP 490, the print quality is better, BUT, unfortunately the cartridges cost more. It will work without loading extra printer drivers. Canon's MP490 is a multi-function printer geared towards photo jobs. As a printer, it's fast and quiet and high-quality. Then, when prompted, connect the printer to your PC and turn it on the finish the setup. I owned 8 printer which were OK but they jamed used lots of ink. I bought this printer 2 months ago.
