I find this wrist pad to be comfortable to use, and to support mouse movement well.The design is similar to just about every other wrist pad; it has a flat area for the mouse, and a padded area to support the wrists. I think it will be beneficial for my wrist when mousing.The pad emits a small level of chemical smell, but it is not too noticeable. The wrist rest on the Fellowes Microban Plush Mouse Pad is the perfect height; it's soft but also supportive. I must have a wrist rest to hold my wrist above that wooden edge. But I'll be honest, I selected it for the wrist rest. This is the first wrist rest I've used. I like the wrist support - I have problems with carpal tunnel, and this is absolutely wonderful to use because it relieves the stress on my wrist when I use the mouse a lot during graphic designing on my computer. I like it, but the padding under your wrist is smaller than my innovera one. I do use it, however, but with the wrist pad turned the opposite direction. My wrist is usually very tired by the end of the day. I was using a 3M wrist pad along with a seperate mouse pad, they would sometimes move apart from each other. When I do that, I roll my wrist along the cushion. The wrist rest is about 6.5" wide and .75" high. Having a wrist rest that uses Microban helps keep the germ level lower, which helps keep us healthier.Non-slip coating on bottom: This coating is VERY non-slip ... feels like a firm gel.Comfortable, thick wrist rest: Fellowes calls this wrist rest FoamFusion. It's very soft and your wrist glides across it.Combined wrist rest and mouse pad. I had gotten away from using a wrist rest in the past because it was just a wrist rest and it seemed too small, and stayed planted in its place, and was a bit too high, making mousing just a bit less comfortable than it should have been. It nestles my wrist perfectly, it feels nice and I don't regret buying it one bit. The Wrist Rest is realy soft and very supportive for the wrist. So, now, instead of my wrist getting sore my inner elbow gets stiff - from being bent at exactly the same angle all the time. My wrist used to get pretty cold before I had this thing, now it's not really an issue.

The wrist rest is very squishy, somewhere between memory foam and gel.

The plush wrist pad is just the right size in just the right place.

The wrist rest is integral at the base.
