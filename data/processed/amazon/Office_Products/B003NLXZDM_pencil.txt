This very well-made pencil sharpener is much like those we had in school when I was a kid, only you won't have to hold the pencil tightly to keep it centered. Usually I use a small, handheld pencil sharpener, but they make messy shavings and I'm not crazy about cleaning them. I was very excited to get this traditional looking pencil sharpener, just like we used to have back in elementary school. )The sharpening itself is great - sharpen a pencil long enough and you'll get a very sharp, pointed tip with the wood removed to a bit under the tip. Tried with both a standard #2 pencil and Crayola colored pencils, and it worked well on both.Overall, I'd recommend this. TheStanley Bostitch Vacuum Manual Pencil Sharpener, Black (MPS1SC-BLK)pencil sharpener is a nice item that works well. This pencil sharpener is a nice item that gets the job done. I got this because I was dissatisfied with the various electric pencil sharpeners we have, and longed for the silken-smooth action of the old-style Bostich sharpeners, complete with revolving openings for different sized pencils and handy vacuum seal that keeps it sturdily attached to your desk as you sharpen. I was sharpening a pencil, Honey. Wow, that's a noisy pencil sharpener! I have to say that this pencil sharpener does the job! Love this pencil sharpener. I like this pencil charpener.
