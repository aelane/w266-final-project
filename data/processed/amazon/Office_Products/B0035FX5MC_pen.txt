Unless your pen is 3" long, you can't use this little holder, anything you put in it will fall out. I added in a pen so whoever was using them wouldn't have to go looking and that was it.My thoughts are that the dispenser is cute and convenient, but I also see more paper being used than if we just had a notepad nearby. It is easy enough to provide my own pen to stick in the short pen holder, so I will not complain.I installed one inside my pantry, so that I can scribble quick notes-to-self about when I refilled a cereal or nut container. It even holds a pen which is great! I also love the built-in pen holder since I'm always searching for a pen when I need to jot down a message or quick note. Even the large pen I used with a grip seems to rattle and lean to the side a bit.In all, I highly recommend this product as one of those small "convenience items" -- especially if you have a busy household. Something deeper would have been better for my pen. A pen is not included.As a nice touch, the directions include instructions on removing the wall mount cleanly.Recommended if you have a crowded or cluttered spot that needs writing materials at-hand (like the all-purpose kitchen counter). But if you use a pen with a removable cap, and put it cap down in the holder, stability is greatly improved and it will stay put.A useful gadget for Post-It mavens. But if you CLIP the pen to it, it's perfect.It includes generic "Velcro" with the now famous 3M removable mounting tape, so if you change your mind, you can move the holder - but you'll have to buy some more mounting strips.Overall, another winner. What are post-its if you have no pen? The average pen is 6 inches tall and it would have been better to make the pen holder an inch higher than the note holder, making the pen holder 4 inches high. The pen is too wiggly and unsupported in a two inch holder, falling over and out too easily.I hope 3M redesigns the pen holder, making it taller and more supportive, as this is a great dispenser for the post-it notes, but it will be better when I don't have to keep picking up a pen off the floor! A skinny pen falls out too easily.

It is too wide to tightly hold a pen or even a sharpie marker.

And it is so short, the pen will fall out if bumped or even when you pull out a piece of paper.

I don't think the pen would do very well in a moving vehicle either.Overall, it is a nice product and can be placed where ever you need a pen & paper
