I truly love the attached pen holder!The post it notes are great (as are all post it notes! I have found this little holder to be helpful. The holder mounts with four glue backed velcro type strips (although they aren't technically velcro - the strips are all the same - they work the same way. First off, I think the pen holder should have been designed better. It has a pen holder (specifically fits a Post-It flag highlighter it looks like). The pen holder is a nice option, too, even if it is a little on the shallow side. I love that there is a pen holder in the dispenser. The pen holder is a great addition too. *The pen holder - I see by the illustration that there's some sort of adapter for the pen holder, but it doesn't come with this. The pen holder should be deeper bu you can get by with a smaller pencil so that it doesn't fall out all the time. The pen holder is extremely handy as don't you often want to write a note at your house and not be able to locate a WORKING pen??? The Post-It Wall Mounted Pop-Up Dispenser is an easy to use holder for those who use a lot of post-it notes. *The pen holder is handy, but why is it so shallow? Over all, a well-mde, nice-looking post-it holder. And the pen holder is right there in hopes people would leave the pen there for when you need it. You could also use the holder for the post-it flag pens, which are cool for quick and accurate little "bookmarks. * Pen holder is built right in too, so you won't be at a loss for a pen when you need it either!I really see no drawbacks to these at all. Also, there is a holder for a pen or pencil. )DISPENSER UNIT:The pen holder is a good size. This holder is great if you're always using Post Its. Likewise, the pen holder is useful, but the whole package is, necessarily, very light, so unless you pull straight up on the notes or pens, you'll knock the whole thing over. The pen holder on the side is a nice touch but it's not deep enough and it's too wide so the pens I tried just tilted out over the holder.You apply this holder to the wall, fridge, or another clean surface with a velcro and adhesive "tape." What's not to love about a cute little post-it holder. It has a handy pen holder (I only wish they would have made the pen holder a bit deeper). The pen holder is not practical unless you have a stubby pen or pencil since regular length writing instruments tend to get knocked out easily. There is a pen holder right there as well. The well-constructed holder is spring loaded, so the pad always stays tight and in place. A pen holder is provided on the side, which is large enough to hold many of larger pens today (those with the "comfort" grips). If you have a sticky-note holder already, you likely won't need to replace it with this. This post-it holder is very handy. and the pen holder too is a great idea for a handy pen.Well recommended. You can put the holder pretty much anywhere by using the sticky strips you can attach to the back, or just keep it on your desk. This holder comes with stickies to adhere this to pretty much any surface. The holder also has a nice slot for a pen (anything the size of a small Sharpy would fit into the slot). This holder is really just a "cooler" presentation for the already available Post It Notes. It is very convenient though since you can attach the holder virtually anywhere. There is even a pen holder as part of the dispenser for easy writing. The pen holder is tall enough so the pen won't fall out, but short enough so it can be dusted.I have a self-made hutch atop my desk. The holder prevents more than one piece of paper coming out at a time. The plastic holder can be mounted with velcro to any wall, using the "removable" 3M sticky things. The holder could work as a stand-up but it's wall-mounted using 3M strips (a new kind I hadn't seen that resemble Velcro w/ sticky sides out -- one on product, one on wall).Plus it has a handy pen holder -- brilliant. They placed a pen holder next to the note holder, only this pen holder is an inch lower, making it barely 2 inches tall. It is an attractive holder and keeps the notes in place and easily accessible. It was very easy to install and I love the pen holder and convenience of the pop up dispenser. This holder is a nice addition, it can be stuck pretty much anywhere  (other than fragile paint or wallpaper). The holder uses the accordion style Post-its.The pen slot is too short, the one design flaw for which I am removing a star. The pen holder is good only for one pen/pencil and is kind of shallow - I suppose if they made it taller then you'd have a hard time with golf pencils.
