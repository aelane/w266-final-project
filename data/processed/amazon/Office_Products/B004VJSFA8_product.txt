It's great when you find a product like sticky notes that is from recycled paper. Avery is environmentally and socially responsible with this product. That makes the product superior to its competitor in my mind. Great product! All in all an excellent product. It does not affect the product, but if you are looking for a super smooth surface you won't get it here. They work as well as any similar product and prices are fair. Overall practical and good product. If not, then you don't need this product and a review of it is of no use to you. Nice product, easy to use. However, frankly3M Post-it Notesare better.By themselves, Avery Sticky Notes is a good product.

This product is 3 pads of sticky notes.

They are recycled, so that makes this product even better.

..for yourself or others.Poor Avery: selling a product that falls in the category where the trademarked name stands for the thing: like Kleenex, like Xerox (for those of a certain age, anyway), most people will know what you mean when you say "sticky note"...and then think "Post-It".Of course, if you were ask to go out and buy some Post-Its, and returned with Avery Sticky Notes, nobody would ever think you weren't paying attention.These do exactly what they are supposed to: provide a small writing space for something you want to remember, and temporarily stick to something.And they do these this things just as well as those differently named products:-)Buy with confidence.
