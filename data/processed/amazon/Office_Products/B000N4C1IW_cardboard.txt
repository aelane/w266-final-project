The cardboard insert which opens it into a squared bottom is easy to insert once you realize how it goes in! They come with cardboard inserts for the bottom of each folder to provide extra support and maintain the flat shape.The shape (and the solution) reminds me of the flat bottom taco shells that are now available. Yes, you have to put in the cardboard piece that fits into the bottom of the file, but that takes very little work. The cardboard insert that gives these files a broad, flat bottom is what makes them better. The cardboard bottom gives an overstuffed file more stability. I especially like how you can re-fold them and add a cardboard insert to expand them out to 2 inch wide. I finally figured out the cardboard that came with them was meant to be separated into small strips (they are easily pulled apart) and put in the base of the folder. You wouldn't want to use the cardboard insert if you aren't going to have a lot of papers, etc., put in the folder. The cardboard piece that keeps the bottom of the folder from slumping is much sturdier on these Smead folders than the Avery. I've had to reinforce the cardboard on many of my older Avery folders, and so far these Smead units are doing the job with no reinforcement needed.Definitely recommended, especially if you use this type of folder for heavier items. The cardboard strip that comes with them to stabilize/support the bottom is rather thin. You simply put in the bottom cardboard insert and add your folder labels.Sadly, the cost of these folders is outrageous hence the 3 star review.
