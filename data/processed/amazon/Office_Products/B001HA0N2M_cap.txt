The cap fits on tightly and the colors are bright and clear. The unique cap shape makes it easy to find and grab them in a jar full of writing utensils or prevents them from rolling away if you're using a white board with a marker tray. The cap, as you can see in the picture, is flared to make gripping it and pulling it off the pen easier. Supposedly you can leave the cap off overnight - I have not tested out that aspect of it.The only thing that would make these a better product would be to have an eraser in the marker's cap.A second set has been purchased and being used at home. That flared cap is sweet; it prevents the pen from rolling around all over the place.We accidently left the cap off one of the pens for two days, the pen didn't dry out, and it still worked. Obviously once you loose the cap its not long before the marker runs out.I do like the narrow tips that allow for more precise writing, if they could fix the caps my rating would go up.Recommendation: PassIf you found this review helpful (or not) please vote below to let others know.Thanks. The cap is designed so they won't roll around or out of reach when using. I haven't tried leaving the cap off for a day to test the claim that they &#34;won't dry out with cap off up to one full day&#34;. Also we left the cap off and the ink does not dry out. They're plenty legible and don't seem to stain.The cap idea is... attractive. The wide cap makes them harder to roll and lose under stuff.
