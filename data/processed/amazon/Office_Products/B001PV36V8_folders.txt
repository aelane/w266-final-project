I've stuck them on several old folders and then was able to put the name on the tab in clean fresh letters -- AND I can read them now, it's actually better than a new folder! I recycle file folders whenever it is possible. On unmarked folders they look very neat and orderly.I will buy them again and NOT write on future folder tabs or use non-removable labels ....after I use up the old folders that I have. If you don't like to throw folders away, these allow for reuse over and over again. I put them on the new folders and they work far better than anything we have used yet." When I need to reuse my old folders I just put these tabs on my old files and there I have new ones :) After affixing these to my folders, I am now able to more easily distinguish between each folder.The sticky part of the tabs isn't ultra sticky, so it's possible to remove the tabs without much damage to the folder. However, when using hanging folders, I still prefer the plastic tabs that extend above them for the best visibility in a large filing cabinet. I like to recycle "used" folders for new topics, and until now - I didn't have a very good (non-messy) way of re-labeling the folders. I have used them on my folders that I got from Amazon and everything is lovely in its new home and looking neat, clean and also colorful.

They hold up pretty well when attached to file folders, although you may want to make sure you have it in the right spot when you first stick them, otherwise you may damage the folder taking them back off.

Many of my folders do not offer sufficient space on their tab areas to write a label, so extenders are helpful.

On older used folders,  if I have written on the folder tab itself, or if the old label can't be easily removed, the old titles show through on these new labels, as they are on the transparent side.
