I cannot recommend this binder because the quality is not up to standard. If you are looking for a standard white binder this is an okay choice, however, if you want something to last more than a semester in the standard kids backpack, look on. This binder stands up quite well to that type of use. This is an average binder at best, and not worth the price... This is a nice &#8220;basic&#8221; binder. And these binder have the nice inserts for pictures, collages, whatever on the front and back covers. This is a very basic white WJ 3 ring binder. Overall a nice binder. This is the first binder that I have used that has the rings on the back cover instead of the spine. All in all this is a good binder. The binder rings are round (rather than D-shaped) which generally limit the number of pages kept inside the binder. I like this binder for two big reasons. This binder is durable, but also portable.This is the kind of binder that will last you a long time. The binder has full inserts on both front and back covers as well as bottom inserts on the inner covers. All in all it looks like a binder that can hold some 200 sheets and take some abuse. A perfectly reasonable 1" binder, with pockets for inserts front and back (both inside and outside).It's flexible enough to fold over (outwards) and sit flat folded "in half". I use this binder (and others) for recipes at home, but don't see much other use for skinny binders these days.Recommended if you need small 1" binders. Sadly this is a very generic binder that I would not pay any more for than the ones you could just pick up at the dollar store. The binder I received for review came in perfect condition. I'm using this binder for recipes.I wouldn't purchase the binder in this size, but think in the large sizes it would be very durable and useful. I have had this particular binder for only a short time, so I cannot speak from my experience as to its durability, but it looks and feels well made and durable.You can insert 8.5x11&#34; sheets inside the transparent plastic and the cover on the front and back, and there are single pockets inside of each cover keeping loose notes and papers.
