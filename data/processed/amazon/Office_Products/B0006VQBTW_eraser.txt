It's handy having the eraser right on the end. What I love about these is the attached eraser. With these, there is no misplacing the eraser. If the eraser seems to get flaky or dirty, just wipe it across a dry paper towel and that takes care of the eraser. It's nice to have an eraser right on the cap, for quick corrections. You need a real white-board eraser, and sometimes you need white-board spritz cleaner too. The little eraser is great, so we didn't need to worry about that either. Likewise with the eraser....it simply is not convenient or useful. The eraser is a handy feature, but flops around a lot when you are using it, they made them a bit too long. They also conveniently have an eraser on the back tip of the marker, which is great for erasing mistakes as you are working.The markers are magnetic, so if you have a magnetic white board they can easily be placed directly on the board for safe keeping.I only gave these three stars because of the fine point (hard to read) and because of the overall life of the marker. I love the eraser on the end of each pen. Just use a regular eraser. Okay, granted, the little eraser is kind of tough to use, and really is for small edits - definitely not for erasing the whole board - but it's still a nice touch. Normally, because of this, I would give it a 3 but I gave it a 4 because it comes with an eraser and a magnet.Quartet - if you want 5 stars, make these markers in an ultra-fine point. I'd rather just use a regular eraser then have that bulky thing on the back of my pen while I struggle to write legibly (I'm a lefty, dry erase is not my friend).If you are buying for the size and colors - these are fine. The eraser tops work to a point, although often we get out the big dry erase eraser instead so that it's not so time consuming. I thought having the eraser on the end of the marker was a great idea--and it is. The built in eraser is a great concept and works well as long as it stays where it belongs. The tiny eraser included on top also comes in handy. Sometimes the eraser popped out, but we popped it back in. I also like the eraser tips, but my issue is with the marker tips.
