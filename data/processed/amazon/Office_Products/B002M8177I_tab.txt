You can either use the whole tab to mark a book, making notes as desired on the sections below OR you can separate a section at a time to use the 2"x3" rectangular "PostIts" to mark pages or leave notes on documents for colleagues.Here's how I'm using mine:  I like to use the index tab separately to mark a page. Do you just need the tab? It's good, then, to have a tab for those important pages the instructor emphasizes.These tabs are, however, too thick for a normal text book. They give you the tab for marking your place and also a clear transparent sheet to mark your place or highlight certain areas. And yes there is one tab that could stick out. While these are easily removed and reused, I can't see myself using them much, there is only one tab for the long row so if I tear them at the perforations then it is just a see through piece of plastic. Each tab has 3 colored blocks attached to it. You may also tear off the tab and use the colored blocks elsewhere.If you plan to reuse the tabs/blocks be careful, because the blocks AND tabs will remove ink or part of the paper. Oh, and since you can write on the whole tab part, you have more room for your text than you would on the typical little rectangles of paper that you slip into the old plastic style labels. When it comes to similar tab and indexing products you can always depend and rely on Avery for help with your organizing needs.Jay Adler I wrote on each tab a brief description of what is on each page. The tab is good for marking sections of a document or book that you want to get to quickly; so it acts like a binder divider. You can also write on that tab easily with a pen or marker. If I choose to tear the tab off there are 3 more good size sheets of 1 1/2 x 2" pieces for a bookmark or to do whatever I want with them. You can write on the tab and stick the piece to a page in a book/notebook. It is a tab that you can see through. Separated from the tab I used them toa. Each tab is actually a tab and three individual writable surfaces. Basically, you detach the tab and mark the page, then use the transparent 1 7/8"x2" adhesive tabs to write on. You can use the tab ones to tab a book or report. You can use the non tab ones--the sheet you see in the packaging is perforated and can be torn into different sizes--to highlight or annotate texts. The tab on the end may be the most useful part of the whole product but still doesn't make it buyable. The tab is a good size, plenty of room to make clear notation.A nice feature is the perforations - this serves two functions - you can adjust the size of the tab to fit it, or make notes and remove them. The tab itself does not have any adhesive attached to it.Is this description a little confusing?
