Since this unit draws each sheet from the center, effectively doubling each sheets thickness as it draws it down it was actually handling 4 sheets at a time. That unit is a level 4. * Review unit provided by Swingline This is a really nice unit. But honestly, the unit shreds documents so fast, it's really not all that necessary. If you just want a good unit that will shred documents quickly and easily, then I think this unit is great. And that's right near the unit - the noise drops off substantially when one draws back a bit.But with receipts and other curly paper, it's fairly hard to aim the paper through the slot and get it to catch into the unit properly. So I think I would prefer a unit that can handle receipts better. But other than that, I like this little unit. The unit is completely self-contained, so once you put papers in and start the shredding, the lid is closed so no paper dust escapes. It's also a heavy, solid unit - feels weighty and substantial and well-made.What's not so great: it's loud when it's shredding, sort of a grinding noise.
