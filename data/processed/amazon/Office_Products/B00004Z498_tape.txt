If you use too much tape you will have a hard time trying to remove what you put up there on the wall etc. But, with this tape I am pleased! The tape is not too hard to remove from the glass/mirror/tile surfaces but expect some difficulty when removing from painted walls. Its tape! Just be aware that the tape can pull off the top surface of any "layered" material.You can attach a fairly heavy object anywhere you want on a smooth, strong surface. 1" wide tape is also available.This product is an indispensable item in my toolbox/fabrication drawer. This tape here is clearly called "Permanent" for good reason. I use this tape for attaching to surfaces that are not smooth... like the dash of my car or the fabric on my cub wall...  so far it is a permanent hold and appears to want to stay that way. I decided to try this two-sided tape, and it works great. Since receiving this tape I have used it to secure a large calendar to my desk, hand a couple of light pictures, and to hold display bottles in place at a chocolate fair.It's light, inexpensive, durable and is handy to have around. Easy to use mounting tape - easy to cut to exact size. The tape is handy and easy to cut for custom fits; the protective paper peels off easily! There is not too much to say about mounting tape in general, except when it does not meet expectations. This tape works great on the signage I have in my office. We use this tape to mount kids' art work to the refrigerator. This tape is proving to be very useful. It is, after all, permanent tape. The tape is a half inch wide and has adhesive on both sides. This tape is definitely useful in a lot of ways. Glue doesn't hold and regular tape is a joke. This tape is amazing and, though I can't say for sure, it truly seems to be a permanent tape. I used this tape to mount them strongly to the shelf. Pealing the tape is easy and mounting it is also simple. So the tape is simple and can be used on most wall surfaces including tile and wood. All the tape had to do was to hold on.The picture stayed in place about 36 hours and then fell down with a clatter. Regular tape just leaves gaps.It IS difficult to remove, though. I tried this tape and it works great! This is double-sided mounting tape, and it holds tight. Also, while this is meant as permanent tape, the foam layer can, in some applications, give you a way to pry off whatever you've taped. I used this mounting tape in my classroom for mounting bulletin boards in the room (as well as to hold in place while silicone glue dried) and had no problems. Probably already have.This double-sided tape is the standard by which others should be judged. What Scotch 33 is to electrical tape, this mounting tape is to.. everything else. Removing tape that I'd stuck to my wall was very easy and caused no damage at all.This is very good tape for affixing items to a wall or other smooth surface.A
