I love that this printer is the same size as my DVR and DVD Player so I can set it towered with them and it looks just like attractive components! I din't have another printer that does that so seamlessly.I'm changing my review to five stars. It's certainly a transportable printer if not easily portable.I wanted to be able to print from my new iPad and now I can. I'm very glad I bought this printer. ***** UPDATE 6/1/2011*****Having used this printer for some time now I have to say I really love this printer.Still on original print cartriages that came with it.Have done "two" HP software updates without one issue. All went smoothly!What I really love is this printer is totally dependable. It hit me this printer reminds me of the alien creature in the movie.You send some print to it, there the printer is quietly sitting all black and motionless, then suddenly the trap slowly opens, and the "arm" swings outjust like the alien opening its mouth, with the teeth slowly extending. Pretty scary printer...But it is a very nice, very cool printer. This printer is on the small side but NOT as small as I expected. This printer doesn't look cheap, nor perform like a cheap plastic printer. I wanted this printer because I use a laptop. Since the printer is so compact there are few moving parts, even the duplexer is built-in.Network SetupBefore connecting the HP Envy 100 e-AIO to a computer (USB), or network (Ethernet), the decision must be made to utilize one or the other communications medium, but not both. While I could see the printer on the iPad from Air Print enabled applications like Safari, select the printer and the app stated that it was rendering a print job, yet nothing came out of the printer, ever!I Google'd the issue and it turns out I am not the only one with the issue; it appears to be a wide-spread and caused by a combination of wireless access point (WAP)/ Router, printer, and iPad compatibility.

The printer is a middle of the road color printer.

The printer tray is not really capable of holding many pages, so this is definitely a light duty machine.

Bought this printer yesterday; set it up today (Mac OS).
