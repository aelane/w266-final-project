The stuff I normally use isn't as thick as this but it's thick enough and cheap enough that that makes up for it if I need to use twice as much.I don't dislike this tape, and if it's available in larger packages at a significantly reduced per-roll price, I'd get it. Definitely better than the cheap stuff. Nice stuff! This stuff is easy to use and I know I can trust Duck Brand. Boy, now that I have used it and see how well it works, I will never go back to the old stuff. Not only is this cheaper but it works better than the old stuff I was used to before they changed it. This stuff is the Real Deal. This stuff is truly heavy-duty. Good stuff! It's much better than the stuff moving companies give out and it's no more expensive. Amazing stuff!
