I don't think I've ever given a 3M product a bad review, and this one isn't going to be the first. I love this product. However, this product really works well as advertised and works CLEANLY.The roll is handy way to keep a long stretch of post-it fun, better than a big paper sheet or small mountain of Post-its. It's a product you'll find yourself looking for often because you run across so many uses for it. Overall I think it is a great product and the adhesive clings well.The only thing I wished is that it had more of a laminated surface so I could use these more in the kitchen. Overall, while this product seems to be a logical extension of the post-it note concept, it is different enough to have new uses but could also be used very similarly to post-it notes except with a different dispenser, variable length and larger adhesive contact area.I have reviewed this item as a "Vine Product" review and I imagine I will come up with new uses for this item. I recommend this product as potentially very useful and a reasonable value. This particular product is a great addition to the line. Great product if you are a Post-It Note junkie like me or if you just need some type of Post-It product to use where a note wouldn't do. What makes this product unique is that it has a very tacky adhesive but it comes off easily without damaging paint or varnish. I like this product. All in all, a useful product. This is one product I'm going to buy again. This product doesn't stick to rubbermaid totes. The product itself deserves 4-5 stars, though. Nice product! What a superb product!! This is a product with a wide application of uses, and good to have around when a situation calls for it. You might initially think that it's a limited product, but once you start using it you realize just how flexible a product it is by how many different ways you'll actually make use of it. The Removeable Label Roll really is a nice product, once you give it a chance. This product is like a pad of "Post-It" notes on a roll of tape.You simply tear it off like scotch tape, put it where you want it, and write what you want on the label.It sticks much better than Post-its, but it can be removed without hurting the item it was attached to. Great product. Great product if what you want is just the right length of fluorescent label tape. Now, I can just use this product! But beyond that, this is a great product and a really nice addition to the Post-It line. This is a great product for doing custom labels. I totally love this product!

I have been using this product in the following ways :* for marking specific passages in books* for writing marginalia - making notes in library books or other books I do not wish to mark up* for holding "I stopped here" spots in books or magazines* to indicate "READ THIS!"

The Post-it Super Sticky Removable Label Roll is a smart product.
