It's a design flaw that really hinders an otherwise nice stapler.If you can get past the annoyance of the design, overall it's one of the nicer staplers I've used. The unique design of the Swingline SmartTouch compact stapler got me interested in the newer style of staplers, that I think Staples, the retail store, first created.The SmartTouch is definitely easier to use than my old Stanley Bostich--requiring less force to push the staple through paper. Nice design and great feel with soft grips on the end. I LOVE the design. The design hash;t changed in decades, and the earlier versions of reduced effort designs seemed not to last. Well I can't attest to how long it will last, but the design seems solid and it does have a noticeably easier &#34;push.&#34; It also seems to go through note papers than I am used to, though that could also be the staples themselves (yes, better staples do work better ... look for the premium staples from Swingline for example ... makes a HUGE difference).My only critique: I wish it held a full &#34;magazine&#34; of staples. This new design prevents you from inserting the whole stack/strip of staples; I had to break the strip into half.I don't recall how other staplers are sold, but I was expecting to see first batch of staple pins included, but it was empty.It is an OK product, nothing to rave about. Really great design.

The ergonomic design does mean it also fits better in the hand if using it upright rather than sitting on a desk.To test out the statement of requiring much less effort, I decided to compare it with the stapler that currently requires the least amount of effort from me: mySwingline Tot(which I've had for going on fourteen years--for that reason alone, Swingline is a brand I trust).I couldn't believe it, but sure enough, stapling a few sheets together with the SmartTouch was easier than stapling with my Tot.

The ingenious design of the SmartTouch provides the user with the best of both worlds.While the stapler is designed to staple up to 25 pages, but I was able to staple 32 pages using both hand crunch and top press methods without a problem.

I love the ergonomic design.
