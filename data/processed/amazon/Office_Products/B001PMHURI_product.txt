I think they are a good product, worth the reasonable price, and very easy to use. Awesome product!! It's a usable product except for shipping.For more infornation about the product, please see my review on the 2000 shipping labels (repositionable) - that application is really the best as I've applied alot of address size labels and mis-stuck more than a few along the way for volunteering.I think this is a good product, but in 2x4" size its use is a bit limited. Overall very good product from Avery. Avery has always been a product that I have trusted over the years, so it was no surprise that I would be satisfied with their 2x4 Repositionable Shipping labelsAs a business that uses shipping labels frequently, I am pleased that I am able to use my Laser Jet and my Ink Jet printers. A great product for $13 and free shipping. I highly recommend this product. Other than that- another great product from Avery. With this product, life gets much simpler as mistakes happen. and it stayed that way.another great product from avery! The product prints beautifully with no issues as long as the paper feed guides are snug against the edge to hold the sheets in the correct position. I mean I've never had a bad product from Avery and these labels are no exception.
