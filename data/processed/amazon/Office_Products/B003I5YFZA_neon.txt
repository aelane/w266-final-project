She loves the neon markers and she can draw all she wants, erase, and start over to her heart's content.At just under $10, this board is a great value. The included neon markers are visually striking. It comes with three neon color dry erase markers in pink, orange, and yellow. Also love the three neon markers (orange, pink and yellow neon) that the board comes with. However the neon looks a bit out of place so, for us, it is relegated to one of the chilren.There isn't much more to say, it works as well as a dry erase board should. The neon against black is cool. We then gave the neon markers to the kids and unleashed them to do their worst. :)I like the neon colors and the black board, but that's a personal preference. The neon markers aren't quite as bright as I expected them to be, but it's easy to read the writing. The neon markers do a fair job, but I have found that if you write more than just a couple of words, then the ink tends to fade a bit. The neon ink erases clearly and completely with just a dry paper towel or dry tissue.This combo pack comes with the board, the three neon markers, and two different ways to mount it -- (1) adhesive strips for a wall or cupboard, and (2) magnetic strips for your fridge. The neon colors add a bit of pizzazz to an otherwise boring and functional item. The neon color delivers, so these pens are a great alternative to the typical color range of dry erase markers. The neon ink is very vivid. If you're looking for really bright neon markers, check out the Expo Bright Sticks. The neon colors, while vivid, were nearly impossible to read on the white board so I will only be using the little black board with the markers. The bright "neon" markers show up well on the board, but there is some "streaking" of the black surface through the marker writing. The neon markers show up beautifully and are just so much nicer than plain black dry-erase on white.The lack of an eraser is so not a big deal. The neon colors included contrast well against the black background.

I didn't think that the neon markers would really look very much like the image on the packaging, but they were surprisingly bright!

So you will want to remember to by neon or light colored markers.The board itself is about the size of a piece of paper and comes with both magnetic and "sticky" strips to fasten to other surfaces.

The neon markers are a nice dice idea, but in practice the markers fall short of the graphic shown to market this product.
