This is very nice thick paper that can be used for anything. Resume is crisp and clean and paper thickness is almost double "standard" copy paper. Great paper for resumes, notes, and other stationary needs. This paper is supremely thick and incredibly attractive. The paper commands a tangible strength and it got me a job. I have been using Southworth Resume paper for the past few years for a variety of purposes. This paper works great with an inkjet printer which is what I use to print on it. I would strongly recommend Southworth paper products for all your important occasions. I bought my paper and envelopes at a major office supply store for a few dollars less than what it is currently going for here. This paper is very high quality, and has a lovely creamy texture and color.

I can't say that this paper will get you the job, but it will have your resume given the benefit of the doubt and have a fair if not longer review because of the presumed quality.

But don't get me wrong, just because you put it on nice paper doesn't mean you are the person for the job.

I wish I found this paper a long time ago.
