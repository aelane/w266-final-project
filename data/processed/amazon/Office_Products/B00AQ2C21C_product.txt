The Amazon product description mentions that this sealing tape "features a polypropylene film with pressure-sensitive synthetic rubber hot melt adhesive". Using a product like Scotch printed message tape is helpful. I am using this product as a aid for my ebay shipping. If they had done so, I would have given the product five stars. I am not impressed with this product. I purchased aTartan Pistol Grip Box Sealing Tape Dispenser HB903 Blackalong with the product to make dispensing easy -- otherwise the tape is pretty hard to handle with just fingers and scissors.The price is high -- regular packing tape is usually about 1/3 the cost of the roll of this tape. This is a typical 3M product, meaning high-quality. It sticks great, and Scotch doesn't make a bad product.

Overall it's a great product though, and I will keep buying it even after this first roll runs out.

Excellent product.

Therefore, it's still a useful product.
