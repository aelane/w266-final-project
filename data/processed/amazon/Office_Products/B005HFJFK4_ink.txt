However... ink is expensive. Although it uses six ink cartridges, the print quality certainly makes up for the cost of supplies. The ink as anyone knows-crazy expensive by the time you've bought yourself three sets of ink you've paid for the Printer itself. The ink goes a long way, and I like that when the black runs out, the other colors will kick in and allow you to print black things for much longer (although it is not as dark as the real black). I am always concerned about the ink cartridges since the Epson I nave has about 10 and one if always going dry. Because I have only now run out of one ink cartridge (light magenta). ?As for ink cartridge price comparisons versus an equivalent HP, I'm not sure, as this printer is still fairly new.Overall this is a pretty fantastic and solid, 5-star printer. After 2days & about 6hrs I still can't get it to recognize its ink cartrides or my wireless. It uses 6 ink cartridges system, but is 2 black ink tanks and a grey. So those ink carts will dry up for not being used. Nor is the ink terribly expensive. Haven't run out of ink yet so can't comment on refill costs.Overall, 5 stars for my performance experience and considering price/value. It comes with the regular ink cartridges and uses a lot of ink. They don't look like they hold much ink so I looked for an alternative. I have often refilled my black ink cartridges to make them last longer but never was able to get it to work for the multi colored cartridges. It was easy to install with great ink and I never have to buy an ink cartridge again!! Yes their ink can cost more than some of the others but their hardware is the top quality and their drivers are far superior to any other printer makers out there (take note HP - Epson drivers actually work for XP and vista - not just windows 7!). If you're really concerned about ink usage and price and don't need the cd printer and dedicated photo paper tray then you should get one of the Workforce line of printers which does virtually everything that the Artisan's do (except cd's and dedicated photo paper tray) but their ink costs a little less - I had one before this printer and I loved it just as much as this one. It uses six ink cartridges that give a stunning color palette for photos and it doubles as a fax-scan-copy machine as well. The ink lasts a long time (and is relatively cheap compared to some other brands) and it's dependable and all functions work great.I thought I'd give this Epson Artisan printer a try, and I am very impressed. The black ink container is smaller and seems to run out faster.So you decide. It comes with "starter ink" which doesn't last very long. I noticed some black ink spots on the right margin of the page on a few of the sheets.Color printing produced a reasonable (albeit lighter) copy of the color image I fed through the automated tray.The printer is light on documentation for its advanced features. I refuse to purchase NEW ink cartridges when I have printed little media on the BRAND NEW cartridges that YOUR company provided with the purchase of the Epson Artisan 837.

The Epson ink is very expensive. The ink cartridges, of which it has 6 (including high capacity black), are somewhat on the small side. The ink is a little expensive but it's worth it for the quality and simplicity.

As always, your ink usage will depend on what you're printing.

There is an ink bay that opens and allows you to install each color in its own bay.

Also, the ink cartridges are fairly tiny so I suspect I'll be shelling out more for ink soon.I didn't like the way the device loaded paper.
