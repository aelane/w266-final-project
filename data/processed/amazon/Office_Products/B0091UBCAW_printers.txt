Still used to wired printers, I found it delightful to need nothing more than the power cord during the whole setup process.User Interface: The keys on the panel are easy to figure out and there are not more than necessary (what's that button do? We have three Epson printers in my family (a couple of us are in college and print A LOT): this one (WF-2540), a WF-2530, and a Workforce 845. Like most inexpensive printers, it is made of plastic which does not impress as the most durable. All the Epson printers I've used have been easy to set up, have had fantastic print quality, and lots of great features. In the past, I've had to hard-wire printers in order to initialize the setup for wireless. Believe me, that was very nice not to have to go through.There may be more impressive printers on the market, but for the price, I don't think you can beat the Epson WorkForce. I have had Epson printers in the past, however, and have not had issues with the products I have owned.I plan to use this for small jobs to do color and black&white; printing at my office if it proves to be fast and economical. I have generally been very happy with my Epson printers, and this one is no exception. I have gone through at least four printers in the past three years. Given that all-in-one printers cost around $400 or more not that many years ago, this is a good value in a printer for home use, or modest home office use. I much prefer printers where you only change one color's cartridge at a time.Only gripe I have right now (and this is probably some sort of user error) is that no matter how straight I think I have the paper in the feeder, it grabs the paper crookedly, so the documents print crooked. All my printers last an average of 5 years, so I feel a 5 year cable for a couple dollars is adequate. I have 2 Inkjet printers, the other is a Canon, and they don't noticeably last any longer with a cartridge.

HP printers have empty spaces where cartridges with built in nozzles glide in.

I already own two Epson Inkjet printers, a WorkForce Pro WP-4020 and an Artisan 800.I was hesitant to try another Epson after having so many issues with the Artisan 800 (namely how it consumes ink and WiFi setup difficulties).

Many printers don't allow that option and force you to buy color ink even when you don't need it.What can I say?
