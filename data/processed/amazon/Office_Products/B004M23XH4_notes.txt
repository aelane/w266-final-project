When I pull the notes, the dispenser stays put. It's easy to load, holds standard-sized sticky notes, and looks cool. I hate fussing with Post-it notes. The notes pop up one at a time. Having the notes pop up one at a time is the way it should have always been. I don't write on the notes before I place them where I want them, so it doesn't matter to me that you can't write on them easily before they're plucked from the dispenser, but one should be aware of that before purchase.The changeable covers are OK..nothing special or striking. It only comes with 45 yellow 3x3 Pop-up notes, but the dispenser can easily hold more. I love that the post-it notes that go in these dispenser are stickier than the original post-its, and don't fall off as easily. The notes pop-up as designed. These notes come in handy when you need a sheet of paper in a hurry or just on a desk for notes or nearby for thoughts. They don't give many pop-up notes with it, so you really have to buy more to use it properly. I use post-it notes, a lot, but have always managed to just pick up a pad and peel one off when I needed it.

As for post-it notes, I have almost no use for them on a daily basis anyway.

This works fine for me, since what I normally use the post-it notes for is page marking and notation, but it would be very annoying if I was just using them to make observations or leave messages.The zebra red is kind of hideous, but I liked the customizable nature of the dispenser and the opposite side of the red pattern is a much more tolerable blue.

The post-it pop-up notes dispenser is very heavy and sturdy.
