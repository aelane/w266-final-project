It was easy to set up (insert tape, insert batteries etc), and has a very intuitive interface. Also I was not impressed since I had to manually indicate the tape size upon setup. tape - black letteringBlack or Green tape - white letteringThere appears to be only the single standard font on the device.With the included 12 mm tape, the font size included:  8pt, 10pt, 12pt, 16pt, 20 pt, 24pt.Font Features include:  Bold, Italicize, Underline and sideways printing.Under a menu there is a symbol directory with very basic symbols such as dollar sign, cent, etc.The clip art directory includes the basics such as fragile glass, man, woman, wheelchair, arrows, etc.The LM160 has a built in cutter, as well.Again, This unit requires SIX AAA BATTERIES or the optional wall cord. I have not printed enough labels yet to need a new tape cartridge - the standard cartridge of tape is 1/2" x 10 ft. and one is included with the product.For its designed purpose, the Dymo 160 is very good for labeling jobs that require a portable unit. I had to press down hard and pull at the tape. I printed another tape for another folder. The tape came loose. I will post if I run out of tape faster than expected.All in all, I think for the price, a non-professional label maker can produce some nice labels with this machine. Although DYMO still beats Brother by not wasting as much tape, the D1 cartridges that this uses are more expensive than the LetraTag LT cartridges. Since Brother wastes tape by sniping off 1/2 inch of label before printing, DYMO is clearly the winner on economy.Cons----- Runs On 6 AAA BatteriesThe labeler runs on 6 AAA batteries and can quickly run up your battery expenses. The tape loads very easy into the back.I wasn't thrilled to find that it takes 6 AAA batteries which I never have on hand so I had to buy batteries, they are not included. They waste tape, but they work.
