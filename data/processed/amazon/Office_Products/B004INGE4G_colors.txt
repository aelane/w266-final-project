The black, blue, and red are your standard colors from Bic. There are four colors to the pen. I love having the four colors all on one pen as I often have projects that require different colors for marking, highlighting, etc..  all in one saves rummaging around for various pens.It's a little tricky retracting the point when not in use - you barely click another color than the one you have been using, and the point retracts with no problem. It is still fun to click down the different colors, but I appreciate that I don't have to go rooting for a red pen if I need one to correct my son's homework. Some colors always worked, some colors on occasion, even if the pen was brand new. Great for what it is, a pen with four colors. It is quick and easy to switch colors when you need to, which is this pens claim to fame. four colors of ink in one place! It offers so many different colors in a single pen, in a pen which is easy to use and to write with. I like that it has four colors that I can use to accent different items in my notes.

It writes well, seems durable enough, has individually refillable colors (just unscrew the pen and slide out the empty color and pop in a Bic ball point refill), and is affordably priced.
