The ink seems to dry up in the cartridge. It printed as if the ink had run out a long time ago. These are listed as Kodak ink, but the ones I received are after market, and are marked Kodak compatible. I've never gotten a bad Kodak ink cartridge, even though it is the most inexpensive I see. It doesn't use the "normal" ink colors like cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. This XL black ink cartridge does produce somewhat less than 2 regularly sized cartridges, but it's still worth the price. This ink is great for everyday use. These ink cartridges last much longer than cartridges I have had for other printers.

But the ink inside can be run of the mill DYE based inks [frequently used on refill kits], or specially engineered PIGMENT inks.

Since the ink is stored in felt pads you can't drink it so there isn't a real hazard.The difference is that the PIGMENT is a long chain polymer, which when mixed with UV inhibitors can "take the heat" of the high energy UV rays.

I'm surprised it's gone this far until I had to buy Ink!That introductory ink printed (in black) a 96 page book, plus 10 pages of graphs heavy in black with little color here and there.
