(The more you pay for a printer the quicker it prints...)-IT DOESN'T ALWAYS PULL THE PAPER EXACTLY STRAIGHT. Whether you are using this printer for documents or photos, the results are excellent quality. I am using this printer for a replacement for the Cannon ones my kids were using. This is our second Kodak printer, I also recently added the Kodak ESP 2170 All-in-One Printer to my office for heavier use with my crafting business. This printer I setup with our family desktop for lighter duty printing tasks, and we've been happy with it overall. That said, I think this one makes an excellent printer for the basic home office, for the student, or for someone who needs a low-cost but high quality photo printer (and by quality photos I don't mean professional photographer, here, I mean the scrapbooking mom). I like this printer, which I got for free through the Amazon Vine program. My other printer at home is a Canon MG5220. All in all, I'd say this is a good printer for using at home.Update- I'd put the Kodak printer back in the box, and was using my Canon until recently. I received this printer with the Amazon Vine program. It keeps saying the printer cartridges were put in wrong but I don't see that they were and keep repeating the task. The other printer set up easily and was printing wirelessly within minutes. It did and now the printer works fine. Very nice and made me feel very good about having a Kodak printer. Ok, this is a sharp printer with some very cool features (wireless printing, print from phone, 3D printing - use with 3D glasses, etc).But after testing several printers (Canon, Epson, Lexmark, HP, Dell, etc), this one comes pretty close to last place. Sometimes I have to restart the printer and it will work. If you're looking for a new printer, this is NOT it!

I was very pleased with that printer and equally pleased with this one.

The printer gives you the `%' of signal strength being picked up from the WIFI router.

Again, you have to initiate from the printer, NOT the Windows 7 computer.
