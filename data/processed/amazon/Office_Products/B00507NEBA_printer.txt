This is a great printer . This printer takes up a lot of space, make sure you have the room. printer cartridges, I plugged it in and turned it on. I pressed that and then the printer did go through the initialization process, a waste of 10 minutes! I really wanted to love this printer, I really did. With this printer, you can easily produce gorgeous lab-quality prints that are ready to frame and hang. Unpack the printer, take off all the blue tape, stick in the cartridges, turn the unit on so it can clean the cartridge heads. I was lucky in that I had one lying around from my previous printer but if you don't have one just FYI!!! You just plug in the printer to the computer (when directed), then unplug it, and you can then print to the printer while it sits ANYWHERE in the house! It's ENORMOUS - this is one BIG printer! Turning printer on will be enough to prevent clogging with this printer.CANON PRO-100 - MSRP $499DYE based printer+Excellent quality on Canon Platinum Pro Gloss, Semi-Gloss, and Luster paper+With above paper, photo will last 50 years framed or 300 years in photo album w/o fading+Very good quality on Matte and Fine Art paper, but...-No guarantee on fade resistance with fine art & matte paper since it is uncoated & porous+Excellent pop and dynamic range than pigment printers - great for posters!+Good Black & White, but it has a very slight brownish tint you would not notice unless you had a PRO-10/R2000 print to compare it to-Some papers are water resistant, but dye is much more prone to water damage than pigment+Fantastic build quality, fit and finish. Listen, I've been printing with a $50.00 Canon printer for the last couple of years. With a printer this large, you do want the flexibility of putting it anywhere you want. Yeah, this just might be the printer of my dreams. The printer was packaged very well and it's very easy to use once you have it set up. I ended up turning off the printer and then turned it back on. When I clicked on a printer offered in the Vine program I had no idea what I was getting into. I'm sure if you have even found this printer you pretty much know what you are looking for so all I can say is this thing is very sturdy, fast and so far no problems. Well, my previous Canon printer and the HP 5510 could not handle these pics with all the white and the glare. I tried them on the Epson printer and the result was a lot more satisfactory.
