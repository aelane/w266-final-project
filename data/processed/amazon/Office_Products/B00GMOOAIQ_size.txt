They are the right size for most packing, though you might consider smaller &#8220;Bankers Boxes&#8221; for heavier items such as books. The size is just right for moving a lot of items(or some bulky items). They are an excellent size - big enough so they hold a substantial amount, but not so big that they get too heavy. they are the perfect size for moving and easy enough to carry but I'd like them better if they had some punch out handles to make it a tad easier to carry. I have some same size ones from UHaul that have the handles and like those just a bit better. They are generally a great size for everything. Great size, heavily made and they actually fold up and fit together really well. These are the perfect size for moving.If you're packing up your house or office, I suggest an equal number of file boxes/bankers boxes with lids & handles, 15x12x10 (from Staples, Office Max, Office Depot - should be $1-2 each for a 10-pack of house brand), along with an equal number of these medium boxes (18x18x16).The file boxes are sturdy and bigger than they seem. Plus, these are a uniform size (no playing Tetris with a variety of box sizes, these stack uniformly).Plus, the box size is pretty ideal for moving; the box is big enough to fit a decent amount of stuff, but not so big that it's too heavy to carry when full.The sections for labeling contents are also a nice touch, though it's usually easy enough to write on the side of a blank cardboard box with a sharpie (so long as it's not a box with colorful graphics already on it). The size at 18x 18 x 16 is large enough to hold a good amount of stuff, but not too big that it becomes awkward to carry. This is a nice size for a box and can accommodate many different items, but I am ending up using these for lightweight items that can be crushed a little and still be okay. I use the small size boxes they offer for books and heavier (and smaller) things. The size was perfect, the boxes were sturdy, and after unpacking them, they're still in such great shape, I'll be keeping them in the basement for some other use.
