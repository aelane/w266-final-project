The tabs are easy to insert, and the insert for the file name goes in easily too. The tabs are hard plastic tabs and are 3 1/2" wide and they slide on top over the folder. The tabs are hard plastic, and they won't break easy unless you really try to break them. The tabs are sturdy when applied correctly, though, so no fear of them falling off. Once the tabs click into place, they don't slide horizontally at all. You don't have to place the tabs into the slots located in the folders, like on the old ones; you press the tab over the top of the folder and the little nubs on the bottom of the tabs press into the little slots in the top of the folder (the folder slot design has not changed, so if you just wanted these for the extra durability, you can always switch out the tabs from the old ones onto the new), holding it in place. The tabs clamp onto the folder and you can slide them around. They also have these great "easy-slide" tabs that make organizing my files a whole lot easier. The tabs are easy to position, and stay put. I'll stick with the old tabs, thanks. The tabs on the folders I use now are the kind that insert in the cut-out slits and tend to fall out easily if I remove and replace the file during the day. The tabs on these folders slide onto the rim (not into tabs), and it's a tight fit. They seem similar to the tabs in other hanging folders but may be a bit bigger.These are good quality hanging folders that are easy on the hands and should hold a lot of files. I personally don't usually use file tabs but I tried file tabs with these folders and found them easy to use with multiple positions. If you are getting these sliding tabs so your folders will be nicely aligned, that might bug you a bit.Overall the folders are great and the sliding feature is very nice.

They came with plastic tabs with spikes at both ends that hook into two slots inside the folder.

They are thick and sturdy - much more so than those flimsy tabs with spikes.

"Easy Slide" implies that these tabs slide back and forth horizontally for easy re-arrangement of the tabs in alphabetical order.
