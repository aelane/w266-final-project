I am sold on this product. I was happy to review this product. I was so happy to see a product like this available. Good product which I recommend. Very nice product. When I ordered this product, I was skeptical that its "super tab" and "Heavyweight" descriptions may be hype for a run of the mill product. I started opting for the cheapest product on the market, thinking they are all made the same shoddy way now.Boy, was I pleasantly surprised.I use, reuse and reuse my file folders until they fall apart.These ARE heavy duty with a generous cut on the tab, just as described.The colors are a plus for visual organizing. I highly recommend this product. A good product.

This does seem like an odd product to send to Vine Members for reviews, but that seems to be the direction of Amazon - stuff.

They won't with this Smead product.

It seems absurd to review  such a classic product.
