This tells our son where to end his letter and begin the next one. My son has a high-functioning form of autism and writing has always been his weakness -- not so much because he "can't" do it but because he finds it boring and hasn't been "inspired" to write. My son is about to finish Kindergarten, and I was hoping that it would help him with his letter placement, and the boxes are far too small for him.I'll try to explain what the page looks like --*It has a green line on the left margin, reminding kids to start writing there. My son in second grade has been getting into writing poems and very short stories. I have a son in 1st grade who needs some help with his handwriting and I thought this paper might be a great learning tool. I'm sure if my son has trouble with spacing, that I'd be happy to buy a product that will help solve issues! Although my son is transitioning, he is also writing in cursive now and this paper does not lend itself to that. My son who is in 2nd Grade and who is a pretty good writer couldn't fit his letters into so small a space. My son now knows to leave one box spacing blank between words. My son had a terrible time learning to write and this really helped him out! My son knows the difference between capital and lowercase letters, and he is now learning to put together sentences, but he has trouble with spacing.
