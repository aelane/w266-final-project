I have one stuck to the wall next to my computer and one stuck next to my answering machine. Sticking it to the wall is my only option, which works great for me so no issues there. It is designed to hang up on a wall or refrigerator. I like that I can mount it on the wall, on the refrigerator, or most any place else where post- it notes are in high demand. I stuck it to my wall on a cork board and it is wonderful. While some might put it on the wall, my "flat" screen is deep enough that it's handily attached to the side of my computer monitor, with Post-Its at the ready and a pen in the holder.This could be made even better by putting another pen holder on the other side, which wouldn't limit one to attaching it to the monitor's right side. It is very colorful so this will look great on any wall and it won't take up unwanted space on your desk or table.Now on to the specifics. It mounts on the wall for easy access.I recommend this product to anyone and everyone especially if you have limited counter or desk space OR you loose your pen and paper very easily. I'm not especially handy, and at first I couldn't figure out exactly how I was supposed to attach it to the wall. I suspect that next to a wall phone this could be quite useful, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to upgrade if I already had another dispenser. I can say that I tried one for the wall and one for the desk and it is really best functional when mounted to something.Since we all depend on these sweet little notes each day, it's always nice to have them handy. These are great because they do not damage the wall when removed. The wall mount is helpful and it is a nice idea. Unless you stick it to a wall, drawer, desk, file cabinet, chalkboard, etc, the dispenser falls over and then it becomes not an easy to use office tool, but one that you have to keep fixing. I have attached one on the wall, next to my desk. It's handy that it attaches to a wall with velcro like adhesion, and I like the pen holder as well.
