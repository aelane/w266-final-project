Nice muted colors...sage, blue, brown. The colors are cool - kind of a muted pastel like color scheme. There are 3 colors and you get 2 of each color. The colors are muted and a bit dull, but not bad. The three colors are rather earthy in nature and not gaudy. Assorted colors, 6 per pack. I love the Earth Tones colors, although some decent Bright Tones colors are available, as well.I highly recommend the Smead Organized Up Heavyweight Vertical Folders for those who desire durability, and for those who prefer the added security of having two closed sides to keep documents where they belong. This 6-pack in coolly natural colors of light olive, steel blue sea, and earthy brown are planet-friendly 100% recycled stock, 30% post-consumer content, coated on the outside, uncoated on the inside. The colors coordinate well and are attractive but are more sedate than cheery:  a pistachio green, a lightish brown, and a baby blue.The label states that they contain a full 100% recycled content with 30% being post-consumer. Also like the various colors that these come in-all six are different colors(olive being my favorite! I like the green and brown colors-- they're folder colors I don't see every day in the office supply stores. The neutral colors will look great in most offices, and the colors allow the folders to stand out well.
