:-)This product is basically a combined specialty scanner that comes with OCR software that was built to work with the scanner. This is who I think this product is marketed for. It's a great product and a great scanner, but it is quite pricey and proprietary. I didn&#8217;t think I could find a product that would fail in every single way that it could, but this one actually did it. Wow, this product is pretty Neat! I am very impressed by this easy-to-use product so I highly recommend it to those who want to electronically file their documents. Like this product for organizing my receipts. It is a great product!

However, I have to admit that after using a less expensive Neat product (Neat Scan to Office) that can import directly to Word or PowerPoint; I'm disappointed that a premium product like NeatWorks does not offer a similar capability.Image scanning: Though not advertised as an image scanner, you can get reasonable 300 DPI scans from the ADF scanner, by scanning (in the Quick Scan window) as a color image, moving the resulting document to the Documents folder, and then exporting the image in BMP / JPG / etc.
