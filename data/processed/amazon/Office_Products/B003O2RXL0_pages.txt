It is perforated so that you are able to tear out the pages. The pages comes out cleanly when necessary and the college ruled is fine for me. The pages are spiral bound and hole punched. It is well made and the pages tear out easily. The pages are college ruled and perforated in case you need to tear them out. The pages have little perforations so you don't have a snowfall of little bits of paper when you tear out your homework. College ruled pages are what you'd expect. The pages have straight-edge perfs, the spiral is strong, the cover durable. All the pages are perforated for easy removal. They are perforated but they don't come apart unless you pull them apart, and the pages won't tear out of the spiral binding unless you tear them deliberately. In this one, you get 200 pages, 40 per section.
