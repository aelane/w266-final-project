To attach the inserts, there are about 5-6 slots. There are inserts that allow you to store CDs, SDs and other objects. The inserts have different pockets and holders of varying sizes to hold stuff. The inserts that hold paper are interesting, but I'm not too sure how practical they are (2 pieces of plastic, which are see-through, sandwich loose paper & then black elastic hold the plastic pages in place). All of the inserts are placed in the binder via a channel system - no 3-ring binder-type holder. The inserts slide into the binder from top down and can be locked in place with a small clip lock at the bottom. The inserts themselves are made of a semi-opaque, non-tear plastic with an embossed logo in the corner.It's all very nice and would make a nice presentation binder or as an organization tool simply for the homeowner wanting to keep track of some important documents. Each of the inserts secure easily by sliding into the inside of the binder and locking. Additional inserts are expensive. Provided inserts have annoyingly strong stickers on them which have to be individually removed. The inserts are very easy to hook up with the binder. I might be needing a few more document inserts to fully utilize this binder/organizer. The "inserts" for the binder are all a transparent plastic, which makes it easy to see which folder has which documents. Of the included inserts for the binder, I like the "secure file folder" and "envelope". The other inserts - "clipboard" and "media file" - don't hold much and are something of a waste of space given you have the ability to put only 8 inserts in the binder at a time.
