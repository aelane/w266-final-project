These fasteners work well with things that are not too heavy, have a flat surface, and which tend to get misplaced. I utilized the fasteners to hang photographs in the office and in my home. There are two velcro fasteners, which have a sticky surface on one side so they can be applied to a variety of objects. Nice fasteners. This is much more sticky than the competing fasteners, which, in my experience, sometimes peel off the plastic backing before you're ready to use them. These little fasteners are the perfect size and strength for many projects. I use these fasteners in my classroom. These fasteners, even though they are smaller than the previous ones, have done the job and stayed fastened not only together, but also to both the TV and antenna. because they are velcro like you can remove or add what you need at any time.These are great little fasteners and have many uses. These fasteners (basically circles of velcro), work just fine for light use. Just calling these "fasteners" isn't very descriptive. These are small fasteners for lightweight objects. I don't think I would really trust these fasteners to sustain the weight of the picture and I certainly would not want to take the risk that would fall.But, these fasteners are great for your college kids who want to decorate their rooms regardless of whether or not you the parent gets stuck with a fine at the end of the year for damage to the walls. These fasteners were not designed for that purpose and will only hold very light weight items on a wall. These small fasteners are great for hanging light weight items on the wall or for securing small knick knacks on shelves. Since these fasteners are heavy duty so they are about 3/16" thick when connected together. As soon as I opened these fasteners I went around hanging things up I've been wanting to hang for quite a while. These small, 2-part fasteners are great for small jobs. These fasteners are versatile and can be applied to metal or plastic surfaces.They are good for stability.They are velcro ,smooth and rough surfaces.You can use them to stabalize mirrors or pictures  that would otherwise tilt,making adjusting a one time thing.They also can be used to secure objects that are often moved or misplaced such as remotes,etc.They are also helpful in hanging light weight objects such as posters,pictures et.I
