I've never been totally enamored with Canon printers previously. Since the early 2000s, I've been fairly pleased with HP printers as a whole and found Canons a little too cumbersome and not quite as user-friendly.That said, breaking the 8.5" x 11" barrier has been an expensive one in the past. While most printers are fairly good at letting you know that ink levels are low, I've had the occasion where things started going awry because someone in the household decided to override the warning. )I have bought/received sooooo many printers that I can't even give you a number. It isn't safe.I truly like most Canon printers and deplore giving this printer a 1 but if you can't even set it up to test it...what choice do I have left? Trust me I have set up at least 10 wireless printers and this is the first one that has given me issues.ADDENDUM #2:  As promised, I tried setting the printer up with a security-free router. I run Windows 8 so that's supposed to make setting up printers even easier. I use printers a lot every day and have several of them around my home and at my office. I now own seven printers, six of which are Canon. One of my other printers uses way more ink for smaller photos and I was worried with this one. With cheaper printers you might be willing to sacrifice some quality to save some money, but you shouldn't buy this unless you are looking for top quality results.As with other Canon printers, some starter photo paper is included.

For my Pro 10 and 9000 printers I select a profile by paper type, for instance Glossy II.

Making printers without video screens is a really bad idea.

Especially wireless printers.
