If you reposition the tab, it's my experience that the ink is not lifted with the glue and no sticky residue remains on the page at all.5. They are great for 1/3 tab folders or to make your own dividers for binders. My pen wrote just fine on the tab, but didn't write as well on the clear part. I didn't check to see if a tab left for weeks would come off easily.Good product. However, by putting a tab on scrapbooking card stock I was able to find each animal quickly. I did not attempt to write on the tab (colored) portion--other reviews cover that.The instructions on the packaging were minimal and Avery does not have a web page for this product at this time. The little tab on top of each note is nice because it acts as an indexing tool or a bookmark. You simple place the tab along the edge of the referenced page. The tab is big enough to write a couple of sentences. I repositioned one tab many times to see how long it would hold up and I was impressed. Put them OVER a post-it (so you still have the nice tab sticking out?) I wasn't intending to remove the tab, my hand just hit it. I do have to be more careful when removing this tab as compared to the smaller tabs.The Notetabs are better for semi-permanent usage. When I wrote on the tab with a Sharpie marker, there was no smear or lifting of ink. And they can be used to turn pages.Both the tab and body surfaces can be written on.They can usually be moved and respositioned without marring the underlying surface. That's how I felt.They have the tab portion which sticks out of the page you place it on. You just stick the tab on the page and write a little note on the tab what the subject is.
