Assembling this side table took about 20 minutes by myself without help; it was easy and simple. Nonetheless, this side table is solid and strong. The side pouch is movable to either side, as well as height.4. I like the side pocket and the smooth rolling casters. I rated Scoot Desk side printer stand 4 stars because it is a nice looking sturdy stand. As mentioned, all of the other side panels and shelves are metal. There's a side pocket, also made of metal, that attaches to either of the side panels that can be used to store printouts or file folders. While the side and back panels are perforated with holes about the size of a nickel, they're certainly not big enough for most cables to pass through.

There is a large side pocket that you can put on either side to hold paper or notebooks and I found it great to hold some of my photo editing and art software in.It's really great that this stand has metal vented sides, so you can put other printers or scanners on the shelves.

And the moveable side tray is a nice touch.My brother doesn't believe this would stand up well if the cart was rolled a lot over a year's time.

I like the attached side pocket and there is plenty of storage for paper and stuff.
