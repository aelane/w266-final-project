This dispenser makes me laugh or at the very least gets a smile. This dispenser really needs some added weight on the base. It also goes well with the purse-shaped sticky-note dispenser to help complete the girliest desk ensemble. Without the dispenser being weighted, it becomes very difficult to pull and tear the tape with one hand. You have to hold onto the dispenser with one hand and pull and tear the tape with the other hand. The Scotch Red Shoe Tape dispenser is just such an opportunity. The dispenser works well and would get 5 stars if only it didn't require two hands to use. As a dispenser this works fine. Knowing that and seeing this cute little dispenser show up as something to try out and review made this an item that popped right out at me.It is an adorable little dispenser but seems to fall much more into the "for decoration" only type category than in the highly usable category.

The dispenser is really lightweight.

This dispenser may not be one of them.

This dispenser holds the tape well and cuts fine but it needs some serious bedazzling and weights on the bottom.
