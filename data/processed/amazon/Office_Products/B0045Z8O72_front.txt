The front and back cover seem a little sturdier than most binders, and it did hold up fine when my 17 pound cat decided to sit on it while it was lying on my bed one evening, something that has caused dents or even folds in other binders I've had. The front cover seems to have a plastic overcoat, while the back cover doesn't. I don't know how easy it will be to keep clean, but probably the front cover shouldn't be a problem. At first I thought that the front cover spotted easily and was a nuisance to wipe off. The front cover has a slide in feature like many binders, front and back sleeves also. The front cover has an outside pocket that you can insert your own cover or contents page in. On the front cover where the black spine does not cover still has the clear plastic over top of the white binder part where you can slip in a "cover" design or label as some people do. It has a plastic-covered front that can hold an 8 1/2 by 11 sheet of paper for those that like their binders to have a "title page." The front cover is covered with a clear vinyl pocket insert, so we can customize it with photos or other decorative touches.Inside, there's one cover on each side for loose paper. The front cover has a clear pocket, so you can insert a title page for your binder, and there are pockets on the inside of each cover, front and back. I also appreciate the front cover, which has a clear pocket. The front does have a cover pocket that is wide enough for a standard sized paper. The front is customizable with whatever you need to make that first impression.
