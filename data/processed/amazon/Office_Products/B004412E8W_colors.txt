I don't care for the primary colors, but they do stand out in color coding paper files. The colors help keep the folders identifiable in a filing cabinet. They are truly heavyweight, the colors are vivid and the tabs cut precisely. Besides that, the bold colors are a help so I can use one color for one class and another color for another class. The colors are bright, and the larger label area is nice. It's also convenient to have four different colors to easily designate the types of information you're storing. Not only are the different  colors a big help in finding the right folder on your desk, the absolutely enormous tabs allow you to write clear descriptive labels. I ordered these Smead SuperTab Heavyweight Folders in 4 colors as I was trying to reorganize my piles of paperwork. These particular Smead SuperTab Heavyweight Folders in 4 colors (red, yellow, blue and green) are miles better than the old manila folders that I'd relied upon in the past. All four colors are bright and the tabs are large enough to write detailed headings so that organization of the folders and papers is much easier. The colors are standard, but the paper stock is sturdy. The colors and cut of the files are very nice. The bright colors and the fact they are thick is a bonus. * The four colors are actually brighter than pictured, so that is a nice plus. The colors are vivid, and will brighten up my filing this year! The bright colors are helpful for differentiating the folders, as well. Vibrant colors for color coding systems. The bright colors are useful, and professional looking (that is, not too girlie). I would use these colors for all my files, if it wasn't so much more expensive to use colored folders than the standard manila or grey-green. And these are not bland, muted, colors; nor are they obnoxious neon colors - just bright, happy colors!I like these folders. The different colors are vibrant and can't be missed when you need to find a particular type of file in a full filing cabinet drawer. The bright colors have helped me get things organizaed around here, which is much appreciated. Having them in colors wouldn't make them better necessarily, but would make using them more enjoyable. They are "primary" colors. The colors are bright and vibrant. They are nice, assorted colors and do have larger tabs. The colors are vibrant and contrasting so it is easier to flip through them visually. The colors are bright. But I like having the colors all different in my file because it make finding the correct folder faster and easier for me.I just love these for my home office, and I highly recommend them. If Smead with just add a few more colors, I would be in organizational heaven. The colors in real life are just as vibrant as they appear in the picture on my computer monitor and the additional space for the label is wonderful.
