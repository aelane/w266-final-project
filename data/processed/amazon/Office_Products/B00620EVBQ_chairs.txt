These little chairs are remarkable strong for their size. These chairs are just the right size for their ages. These chairs hold up extremely well and support even children too large for the chairs just fine. The chairs are easily cleanable and stackable. These 12" chairs are designed for kids up to about age 7, although they're admittedly rather small for 6-7 year-olds who are large for their size. If you're looking for chairs for larger kids of that age or slightly older kids, I'd recommend choosing the 16" chairs to avoid discomfort.As far as durability is concerned, they are extremely well-constructed, well-balanced and sturdy. The chairs never look wobbly with kids sitting in them, and they don't slide around on kids like some others. With many plastic chairs we've had, the laminate/metal construction has led to backs breaking off or seats warping, and that doesn't happen with these resin chairs.These aren't inexpensive, but the quality in this case does justify the price. I got these chairs for my kids to use in their playroom. These chairs are exactly as described here on Amazon.com  They are well made, and virtually indestructible. In all, these chairs will work well for classrooms or Sunday-school rooms but will also work for a playroom, schoolroom, or project room at home. Not sure that I needed more chairs, but when these came in I was surprised...My son claimed them as his own. The chairs seem sturdy and well made and are easy to clean if needed.
