The erasers on the end are a nice touch and work pretty well, however they are obviously not meant for erasing the entire board.I would not recommend these for office use/large board use however. The attached erasers are useless.They are SHODDY:  The magnets are weak, which makes the markers slide off and/or get knocked off easily. The erasers are not only useless, but they fall off after a few days use. They have little erasers on the cap, which is convenient for making a small correction. The cap-mounted erasers are very handy and provide a quick and clean erasure of the board without having to keep tissues or paper towels on hand. The erasers remove the dry-erase markings without leaving anything behind on all surface  I tested on. The small erasers are handy for erasing part of an image or letter--as opposed to our large eraser which can tackle the entire board.My 5 and 7 year old have had no problems replacing the caps, but the orange marker is starting to dry out from being used so much. The erasers are easy to pull out, but that hasn't been a problem.The ink seems to erase just fine, even after being left on the board for a day.They really are low odor and come in a small plastic pouch which would be handy to slip into a bag (with a small whiteboard) to carry on a car trip.Overall I'd say this is a good product. I do like the handy erasers. They write well and having the erasers right on the cap is super handy. The erasers are not glued in so they fell out a few times, pulled out by my kids a lot, and two are now lost. The attached erasers are a real plus, as far as convenience goes. I've tried using the erasers, I've tried using water and scrubbing at it with a paper towel, but the marker stains just won't come off! The erasers pop off pretty easily- easy to lose and I wouldn't recommend them for small children.
