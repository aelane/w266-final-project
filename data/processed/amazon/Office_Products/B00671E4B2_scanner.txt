I regularly travel overseas and intend to take this scanner with me on the road. But the scanner does not work with the netbook out of the box and requires the A/C adapter which I now need to buy separately unless I want to lug the much bigger and heavier laptop around with me. Call me nit-picky.Finally, just to mention it: This scanner will not work with books or, let's say old 19th century carte de visite photographs which are too thick and stiff to go through the device. I once thought that the best lightweight scanner was made by Fujitsu, as I own the M300 and the S1500. This is the ideal scanner to carry to the library, to a meeting, or on a plane as it is sturdy and folds up neatly and snugly into itself for compact carrying. Amazingly, for a scanner so small, it scans duplex. This allows the scanner to be used with virtually any machine, Mac or PC. You want a scanner that will last. When you plug in the scanner and turn it on, it'll show up as a drive called ONTOUCHLITE. However, you can start scanning as soon as you plug the scanner up to a PC without installing driversc) nice card slot for scanning business cards; can also scan checksd) accepts up to 20 sheets of paper and the scan results are clear.
