The suspended mouse pad is also perfectly situated. The mouse surface feels plenty secure, and I never feel like I'm stressing the tray at allMy only complaints are that my keyboard, a Microsoft Sidewinder, is wide, and doesn't fit perfectly on the tray when the number pad is attached (it's removable on this keyboard), though it is workable. The mouse pad may be attached on either right or left side of the keyboard platform, depending on preference and or "handedness. The mouse caddy may be adjusted in relation to the keyboard by positioning the sliding attachment and also by rotating the caddy. The mouse caddy is conveniently located, and also feels very secure in use.Overall, this product is well engineered, and installs in a straightforward process. The mouse pad may be attached on either right or left side of the keyboard platform, depending on preference and or "handedness. the mouse stand of course remains flat, but allows you to place it at varying distances from the keyboard.This unit is solid and well made, but you need to confirm all your measurements before ordering. The mouse pad can be attached to the tray on either the left or right side and the ability to swing in or out makes it very compact. I am used to my mouse next to my keyboard in my keyboard drawer. I love how the mouse platform feels and looks, though. It's very attractive.PROS:+ attractive, would look great in most offices+ mouse platform (can be used on either side and adjusts up, down, swivels)+ comfortable wrist pad+ tray adjusts up, down, swivelsCONS:- does not fit all desks- does not fit all keyboards- desks with lip limits its functionalitySUMMARYThis looks like a nice tray, but it's not for everyone. The circular mouse pad can also be positioned multiple ways. Your mouse will be on a pad that is slightly slanted. I don't use the mouse tray because it seems to small for me, I just keep my mouse on my desk. The mouse pad I didn't particularly care for. The mouse and keyboard trays adjust easily and seamlessly.
