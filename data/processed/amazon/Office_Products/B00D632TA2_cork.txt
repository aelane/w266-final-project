I have bought cork board where the boarder is loose and falls off in the past, or it just has a cheap feel. Even so, that was still easy.The cork is tight enough to take and easily hold push pins, sewing pins, etc.No complaints, no negative issues.5 stars. This is an extremely simple cork board made from a sheet of cork attached to cheap corrugated cardboard. It's a no-frills, just-thick-enough cork board.It comes with mounting hardware but it's light enough that I put it up with a bunch (like 8 - I covered most of the top) of those 3M velcro picture hanging strips. I'm not sure exactly what one can say about a cork board. This is a decent enough cork board although the cork is not super sturdy. Hanging it was very easy and the cork was good quality, I think it's going to last a good long time. This would be the perfect cork board for the photo shoot.This corkboard is very nice-looking, but sadly, that&#8217;s the only good thing I can say about it. This cork board is very sturdy and well made. I am going to cover the cork with some decorative fabric to pretty it up a bit. This is a pretty standard cork board. The cork works really well and has good thickness. The cork is quiet dense and is able to hold things such as greeting cards and any reminder cards or photographs with a single pushpin. This is quite a large cork board so make sure you measure your space before ordering this. The cork is dense so the pins do not fall out easily. Nice cork bulletin board. This Quartet Cork Bulletin Board is a larger cork board that comes with hanging hooks and it goes up in minutes. This large cork board came flat packed in a pretty big flat cardboard box with room to spare inside so there was no damage to it.I have an old cork board that's about 30 years old and I can say that they don't make them like they used to. That's because the cork is thinner and the frame (not plastic) is made of some kind of compressed board with an oak veneer finish. If it was made like my old cork board it'd probably weigh a ton.The board comes with instructions on the back and mounting hardware. Compared to other cork boards it appeared to be a very good bargain based on price and the Prime shippingoption. The cork itself is sufficiently thick so that a normal push pin can go all the way in without bottoming out. I will note that the cork part isn't 24&#34; X 36&#34;; that is actually the measurement of the outside of the frame. The cork itself is 21 7/8&#34; X 33 7/8&#34;. This cork board went up easily with the hardware and anchors provided. The cork is good quality (not dry and cracked like some others I have seen). I recommend this cork bulletin board for home, and light business use. I got this cork board to review through the Amazon Vine program. It's fairly lightweight which makes it easy to mount.The cork board comes with wall anchors and hangers to hang it with. Definitely recommended if you are looking for nice, lightweight cork board.We haven't been using it all that long, so I am not sure how it will hold up over time. Much easier to see what you are looking for.For me, having a cork board or something similar (dry erase board) is a must to be organized and I dislike intensely putting papers or photos, business cards, etc on my fridge.My only complaint with this board is that the frame too closely resembles the cork in color and I don't like that. I put this cork board in my sewing area for incoming orders from my Etsy shop. It is difficult to get excited about reviewing a cork board; but the good people who made this one sent me one for free in exchange for an honest review. So, here goes...The cork board arrived in perfect condition. It seems like the cork may be a bit on the thin side, but I think it will work fine anyway. Very good cork board for the price.

Great cork board for my kids' projects. It's a cork board... not much to say about it.
