These tabs are useful and practical. I tried playing around with these tabs, and even tried thinking of other uses because I truly like Avery products. However, I was wrong.These tabs are made of rigid translucent plastic that you stick on a page to use as tabs. It's nice that you can keep the tabs in the original packaging if unused.WRITABLE ON BOTH SIDES OF TABS PLUS ON TOP OF PLASTIC SURFACES USED AS REMOVABLE HIGHLIGHTERS:You can write on both sides of the tabs, even the shiny side with ball point pen. These are repositionable tabs with a huge non-tab portion that you can reduce the size of as you wish. Having repositionable tabs is quite useful for books that you refer to a lot. These are useful tabs that are made out of plastic and should only be used for permanent documents or books (they are not recyclable). These tabs will get me organize for the new year. These thick tabs are best used for scrapbooks or any home-made written collection where certain passages need to be preserved so that ink won't run or fade. Although the colored tabs are nice, the small rectangular stick-ons would be better if they were clear, as the thickness of these tabs alone would draw attention to the reader.The tabs are firmly held in place but are removed without damage to the page, however, I'd be cautious around older paper.So, I'd recommend these for scrapbooks and not textbooks. These tabs are great. If you are looking for JUST tabs, then this is not the right product for you. These tabs are about a thousand times better than the regular tabs that you have to insert into those small slits on your typical file folders and then insert a small piece of paper into them with whatever you tried to type (if you can find a typewriter these days). These adhesive tabs are great for organizing papers and are very easy to use. I could write on the tabs what needed to be done for my boss. The tabs feel very sturdy and durable, the note section allows me to read any portion of the recipe under the note and I like that I can separate the note into 4 different pieces. The tabs are just right for several uses that I have had an opportunity to try but the tax one is the best. These tabs, which are sturdy enough to be used to index books or records--sturdier than their paper counterparts--are made of a plastic which can be written on.What you get in a package are twelve long pieces of this plastic, which can be torn at the perforation to make four pieces each, but it is unclear what use the last three pieces, without tabs, would have.I would recommend this particular set of tabs only for a small job, say, indexing a textbook for an open-book exam. I love the tabs being plastic, but the post-it like part I'm not fond of. These tabs are about as long as a bookmark, they are so sturdy, and would easily mark out chapters or important information in any text or notebook. There are tabs for putting on the side of pages or folders for marking things. These tabs are excellent for keeping and finding one's place without bending a page, or making the book thicker with a bookmark that may become dislodged. Folding two tabs over each other again became a great place holder that I used to take notes on.b. The tabs did not smear the pen marks I had on the page and I was able to see these marks through the translucent material of the notetabs themselves. I put tabs on four types of books - a Better Homes and Garden's cookbook from 1981 (paperback, yellowed and wood-chippy paper), a copy of the Moosewood Cookbook from 1977 (oversized paperback, thick textured paper), a copy of the Joy of Cooking from 1997 (hardback, smooth rag paper), and a recent issue of Cook's Illustrated (very smooth and glossy magazine paper). After all, tabs for marking your place in a book have been around for years (decades!). They can work as tabs. The tabs can, if rotated 90 degrees, handily fit in the margin of a hardback book without overlapping the text itself.All in all, these are more useful than you might think. The tabs on the top are very sturdy and have held up quite well to my throwing books in my bookbag, taking out, throwing in again...since it sticks out a little for you to find it, one would think it would easily get torn up...but these are surprisingly strong tabs. I can understand using the tabs by themselves, but the frosted plastic sections, alone? These tabs are even more flexible than the smaller ones because they are perforated and enable you to use as little or as much as you want with the tab. These tabs are thick and sturdy, and big enough so you can clearly identify what is being marked. These post-it tabs are fantastic for reference books, and shared files. While tabs on the lower sections might be nice, they still work just fine and also allow me to highlight/note-take on several parts of the same page.What I don't use for marking up research books, I use to edit manuscript pages. The tabs are also great if you work in an office and need to bring someone's attention to a page in a document - say for a signature, initial, or comment.I like the color coding of the tabs and the fact that they can be reused. These plastic tabs would be very useful for students, editors, cooks, or anyone else who needs to make temporary notes in books or other hardcopy, but does not want to write on the paper itself. These tabs are nice and sturdy. The tabs are repositionable so you can reuse them (or reapply them if you put them on crooked).Each tab comes attached to 3 transparent squares that also have the repositionable adhesive on the back. I would prefer to have more tabs and fewer transparent squares.It's a little more difficult than I expected to tear the tabs/dividers apart. You can pull the tabs to open to the page you need instead of having to run your finger in front of the tab and open it manually. These strong tabs looks like they could last many years and are pretty strong, making them quite handy for the obsessive note-keeper.Overall, though it might be the dream for the note-obsessed, they're not only expensive but don't really work for all types of books and really are kind of unnecessary. The tabs themselves are nice and thick.
