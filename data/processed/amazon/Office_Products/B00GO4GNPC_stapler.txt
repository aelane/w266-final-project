Great basic stapler. But, if you need a stapler that will actually staple between 16 and 20 sheets--I'd keep looking. The stapler I received works well enough, and doesn't take up a lot of space my desk. The stapler itself has &#34;customize me&#34; printed directly on it, so unless you want that staring at you, you really will need to order a skin.There's a ton of different premade designs, but we opted to make a custom one using their online tools. Swingline Customizable stapler is so awesome! It's a nice stapler to have at home with smaller jobs but if you are looking to use this in an office, I'd think twice. It&#8217;s important to note that this stapler is medium sized and this is not at all full sized. It will include a plain white stapler and an online pin code that will allow you to select a single custom skin. The stapler itself takes regular sized staples. Not to mention that most of this stapler is plastic instead of metal so its durability will not be as good as a metal stapler. You just get a blank stapler and a coupon to redeem online for a free design mailed to you. Lightweight and compact, this customizeable stapler handles 10 sheets well but if you have a bigger pile than that, you will be disappointed. This is a basic, lightweight stapler. It's a basic stapler that can only handle about 10-12 sheets before it starts struggling. This stapler is well-crafted and durable, worthy of the Swingline name.What makes it really great is the fact that it's customizable. I love our new stapler! The stapler works fine. Boy, did I need a new stapler at my home office. The stapler does a decent job of stapling but I found it to only go through about 10 pages of thicker paper instead of 20. Though this stapler does go through the 20 claimed if the paper is much thinner than card stock. So I needed a stapler for simple things like college papers and readings. So I've had this stapler for two months, and it's still just white. Unless you REALLY want a customized stapler for some reason, I would advise you to just purchase a regular old stapler that will get the job done. This stapler does not come with any staples when you purchase it. This stapler is really cost prohibitive, especially considering it can only handle small jobs. This is a very low priced, cheaply made stapler only worth a third of what its being sold for. The stapler is very light weight and is on the cheaply made side. I only needed a stapler for use every now and then and this stapler fits the bill I just should of looked for the skinless design and saved money. So the stapler looks awesome. On Sunday, I carefully removed the stapler from its plastic packaging. Behind the stapler was a blue, rectangular coupon that the owner uses to go online and redeem the customized skin for the Swingline Customizable Fashion Stapler. It is a small, solid white stapler with the words "CUSTOMIZE Me!" Also, the new stapler operates very easily and efficiently. I proudly showed my customized stapler to several coworkers and they were impressed. However, its customizable Skin is what makes the stapler expensive. A personalized stapler is more useful that a paperweight, especially when it has a photograph of you and a loved one together. This is a nice-looking, serviceable light-duty stapler, but describing it as having a 20-sheet capacity is an exaggeration.It can be a problem to visually locate office tools if they are a similar color to the surfaces they are on, such as a black stapler on a black file cabinet. That's what attracted to me to this stapler--either left plain white, or with a SkinIt applied, it would be easy to locate on the dark surfaces in my home office.I would have been happy to leave it plain white, but the Customize Me message on top can't be removed--so I ended up ordering a SkinIt sticker. The stapler looks very nice, and worked fine with standard staples on the first few tries.However, for the sake of writing this review, and to my regret, I tried stapling 20 sheets of paper with this. The stapler is working again now, and since I usually only have to staple a few sheets at a time, it should work out fine for me. Okay, so this stapler comes with a code that allows you to go to a website that sells skins for a bunch of different items (mostly tablets and phones and stuff) and get a free (now that you've paid for the stapler) skin. This stapler arrives with a white cover. The stapler works fine; again this is a very basic stapler, and the added cost is directly associated with the custom skin that is offered. I ordered this stapler because I thought it would be kind of fun and add a little personality to my desk. It's a rather standard stapler, though a bit boxy in its design. The stapler comes with a promo code that allows you to order your skin online. With the stapler being so narrow, the preview feature on the Skinit site is really a serious problem. Sure, it didn't hurt the stapler's functionality, but it certainly didn't make the skin worthwhile either. But if you want to have a personalized stapler & you don't mind Swingline/Skinit having your email & shipping address, then this is a fun desktop accessory. A stapler for the kids. Not a stapler for bulky, industrial jobs. The stapler itself is lightweight, I am wondering how it will hold up long term, but so far so good. The Swingline stapler is a great size for my home office. The stapler itself is of Swingline quality - not one of their higher end, heavy-duty staplers by any means but for the price point I think you pretty much get what you pay for. Yeah, this is the first stapler I have ever seen that is sold without any staples, not even one strip. The stapler is good for kids. We have had the stapler for a month now. I would give the stapler 3 stars if was not for the free skin from Skinit.The selection of skins from SkinIT is large with multiple categories. It's an okay stapler but I found the decal to be a hassle. Can a stapler make a good gift? Instead, I had to measure the stapler to figure out which part of the design would be on the top vs. the sides. This Swingline stapler comes with a skin of your choice that you order online. It's not a full-size stapler, but good for my small desk space. Our old stapler gave out, so I was excited to try this one through Amazon Vine. I tried to search for a stapler, but nothing came up. It works as well as a larger stapler in much less space. Very nicely made stapler. This is Swingline, so I expect a stapler that says it will do 20 sheets to staple 20 standard sheets. I already, supposedly, had a stapler. This new stapler is clearly mine. What you are purchasing is a plain white Swingline stapler with no staples included. Skinit makes this basic Swingline stapler 4 Star fun! I love that it can be personalized and be a stapler that is really reflective of your individual style.The Skin-It website was pretty easy to maneuver but a little slow. There is no mistaking whose stapler this is! It says 20 but I would never try that many.This stapler is awesome looking, but it is not for heavy use. I really like this stapler. This small, desk-size stapler comes in white, but don't let that fool you. The stapler can staple 20 sheets at a time. I got this stapler because it seemed like a great idea to add my favorite team logo, The Chicago Blackhawks, to a nice stapler. The stapler is fine, but, the skin-it site is worthless. So I seldom need a stapler, and when I do, it's for a dozen sheets or less. It is smaller than the normal stapler and has a slightly more square design, most likely to make it easier to customize. She was able to peel it off and stick it onto her stapler herself. It looks beautiful!The stapler itself can staple 20 sheets (but you have to push down really firmly! My favorite stapler is actually a Swingline, which is probably 20 years old and built like a tank.
