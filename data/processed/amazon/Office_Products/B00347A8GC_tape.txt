I used this tape to paste some frames on the door and the wall. This mounting tape holds up to two pounds! I went back up and added more tape to it. It's been my favorite tape for ages. I tested this tape and was not as impressed as I would like to be. Strong and versatile tape. It's very strong tape and has handled a variety of materials for me. One can use this tape for most light duty mountings of any object to clean and not heavily textured surfaces. I wouldn't call it a "permanent" mounting tape because objects can be detached from the tape with some moderate effort.The MAIN thing to remember is Surface Preparation when using any type of tape or adhesive; I usually clean the surfaces with a small amount of rubbing/isopropyl alchohol and then remove any residual dust with a can of compressed air. The tape can also function as a buffer/protective cushion, e.g., small strips between my carbon fiber bicycles' bottle cages and the frame. However, Scotch Tape is more than just cellophane tape. To see just how well the tape works, I tried applying it to various surfaces including plastic, corrugated boxes, metal, glass, wood, and a painted surface. The more mounting tape used, the more weight it can handle (follow manufacturer's recommendations). If you're still undecided about purchasing this tape, "Try it, you'll like it". I doubt this tape can hold heavy things, but I haven't tried either.Double stick tape has a wide variety of uses and is always useful to have on hand for sticky problems. One should be careful when using this tape to hold things to a wall etc. This tape performs exactly as intended. The tape has never failed.The tape is easy to work with and cuts readily with a pair of ordinary scissors. Use enough temporary tape and a light object - and it's not only permanent, but repositionable (another 3m word)Lastly - its pretty obvious, but the more tape you use on your project the more weight it will support. This double-sided strong adhersive tape works well for many applications, such as hanging a small picture frame or holding a plastic cable track on the wall. This tape has significant value and I feel very positive about its ability to get 'er done. Consider this tape to be the double backed version of duct tape. The tape is a thick foam that is very sticky, and can be squashed down to hide it affectively while still holding its sticking power. It's good strong, very versatile tape that is a must to have around, and I highly recommend it... I used this tape to hang metal crosses and pictures. Also, I have not attempted to peel the tape off of a painted or wallpapered wall to find out what happens to the wall when the tape is removed... This tape did the trick (though I would not get too ambitious with anything too heavy). This tape comes in strips and rolls in a variety of sizes so check your requirements.This permanent tape works pretty good indoors on flat clean surfaces. This tape has a lot of other uses. I keep unused tape in ZipLoc bag to extend shelf-life.The "permanent" in the name means that it's a pain to get it off. Basically, the tape is a slim piece of foam with strong adhesive on two sides. It sticks much better than just double sided tape. I used this tape to hang some vintage framed portraits and it worked great. I tried this tape on the bottom of my shampoo bottles to keep them from sliding off the slippery shiny granite shelf in the shower and it worked great. This tape is rated for up to two pounds but it depends on what you are sticking and what you are sticking it to whether it will hold permanently or not, use good judgement. I'm not comfortable they would stay up because they were very easy to remove and the tape peeled off the wall as well as the plate with no effort. This is a good tape that has many light duty uses but it is not permanent on all surfaces. This tape is a cheap alternative. I don't buy Scotch mounting tape for any special reason, but it is always handy to have around the house and there seems to always be something I can use it for. I had tried to use "normal" mounting tape but the surface area was too small to "lock in" the paintings and they would ultimately move off the tape.THIS size, however, has been perfect for the securing of our paintings! In the past most mounting tape I've used works for awhile, then if it gets cool in the room the items you've hung just fall off the wall.This Scotch mounting tape so far is working really well, though, everything I've hung has been well under he 2 lb. What I really like about this tape is that it's got a really strong adhesive, but, I was able to remove items that I had hung to reposition them on the wall and they never once fell down.I'd recommend this for anyone with some lightweight hanging to do on most any type of wall. Much better than double sided tape to hange the occasional poster/picture = whatever. This double-sided strong adhersive tape works well.It is very strong. It's amazing what you can make or fix if you have the right tape or glue.A
