I love the pockets on the inside and the cover is heavy duty. The pockets are made a bit better than some of the others I have had in the past. There are side pockets to keep pages that haven't yet been incorporated into the book.I know, it is &#34;just a notebook&#34;, but anyone that has had experience with interactive notebooking knows - it really and truly does matter. The inside pockets are convenient and the paper is smooth. Except for the two pockets rather than four as advertised, I give this notebook five stars. It's handy to have the pockets if your teacher likes to use a few handouts or if you want to stash your finished quizzes and exams. There are pockets in the notebook to hold handouts and Syllabi from your teachers. The two pockets in the front are a very nice feature for storing loose papers.

it has pockets for things and the ruling on the pages is clear and precise.

The interior pockets can be stuffed to the max and are very durable.

I like the pockets for holding loose papers on the inside, and the college-ruled paper is less flimsy than other notebooks.
