The board fell right off the fridge and the plastic boarder cracked. I do like that this board had a clip to hold the special pen to the frame. I like that the board is magnetic and I can attach a grocery list or business card to my board. I picked this dry-erase board because of the colored frame. The board is easy use and the two magnets hold post it note size messages. So we got this board for our refrigerator as a means to jot down any items we might need on our next grocery shopping trip. The board comes with four adhesive magnetic squares that easily attaches to the board, so that you can adhere it to a metal surface such as a fridge. As far as the white board goes, it works excellently, and does what it is supposed to do in regards to being easily erased. This board stays mounted to the fridge quite comfortably, although you'll need to remove the (round) magnets that it came with. This is a great wipe board with the option to have either magnetic or permanent adhesive to affix the board to a wall or metal surface. Still, it's a nice little board for a side by side fridge.Also I think it would be better if the magnets that get attached to the back were stronger. Sometimes the board slides around when trying to write on it. My board does not look exactly like the picture.I has the marker, the magnets but the frame is bi-color (black and white).The frame feels like ready to break apart.The provided magnets are so weak they cannot support the weight of the board on any vertical surface without sliding.I know this item is not frankly expensive but the quality should at least match the expectations... This 8.5 x 11 dry-erase board is an average product. The white board works well and I like the fact that the pen has a built in eraser. Great board, crap magnet backing. The Quartet board works well for an inexpensive board. To prevent the board from sliding, I had to put additional magnets underneath it to stop it from sliding.The face magnets are actually just fine. Great dry erase board. I ordered this dry-erase board for my son's room, and he really likes it. They are very secure and keep the board anchored to the wall. The board wipes clean very easily. Actually, they are attached to the board with that gummy sticky stuff. They stuck to both the board and my refrigerator.Overall, the board is affordable, but if you are looking for a product that will last, I would choose another one. I got it to replace a similar board that recently met with an unfortunate accident. My old board was a different brand, (I can't remember what one) that had similar magnets that you attach with the included double sided sticky pads, but my old one stayed on the fridge and didn't move, this one slides right off.
