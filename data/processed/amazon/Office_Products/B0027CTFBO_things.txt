I recently moved and used just my little VM New Beetle to transport things from one house to the other and these boxes were great. Few things are as frustrating as wrestling with tape when you're trying to pack.Anyone who's been involved in office moves will probably be familiar with the concept, so it's just a case of reacquainting yourself. Perfect for organizing and storing things because they can be moved pretty easily, stacked and restacked as needed and there is a place to write the contents--on all four sides. It's super for storing things I want to get to from time to time but don't have a place for in the house. I was able to take things out of storage bins like my kids old toys they won't part with yet, cut fabric, seasonal decor, books, and winter linens and store them away in these boxes. Or, to store things you don't have to get into very often (like holiday decorations).I probably wouldn't recommend these if you are looking for SERIOUS storage options, but for a general move or light storage, I think they are perfect. There are several things that I like about these boxes:1. I would not store things in them for a long period of time that are not already inside something else because they can not be completely sealed like a tote but for things like hallmark decorations which are already inside another box they work great. For light weight things, you probably don't need to spend the money on these, but if you heire movers, they usually will charge you for boxes or use used ones (and who knows what was in them). I think the only things that have fallen apart a bit are the folds that tuck into the handle that keeps the lid down. To make sure the things in the boxes are secure, I have had to use huge amounts of tape all the time.
