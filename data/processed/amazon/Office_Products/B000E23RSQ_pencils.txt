These pencils Floooow across the paper. These pencils are beloved of colored pencil artists. Sharpen these pencils with an electric sharpener. You should try a few more pencils. These pencils develop cracks in the leads if they are treated roughly. These pencils are NOT made in the USA, as advertised! When my pencils arrived, I was astonished to see very poor packaging. These pencils arrived in a box with 4 other items. If the pencils were judged only on performance, they would get 5 stars. I did not return the pencils because after testing them, there was, miraculously, only one broken lead! I had about 3 pencils break several times, but it was always after I had sharpened them to a razor edge, which they are really not intended for. I refuse to give Prismacolor pencils anything lower than 5 stars, simply because they really are truly the best I have ever used, even though..They are in transition. I frankly don't care where they're made, but SOME of the pencils were made with a poorer quality wood. There are several of the older-style pencils in the set, so if you are looking for a perfectly aesthetically pleasing, style-uniform set of colored pencils, good luck at your local art supply store? )Are these pencils perfect? Good pencils.
