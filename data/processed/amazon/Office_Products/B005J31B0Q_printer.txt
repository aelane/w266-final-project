This is probably not the best printer for photographs, though the high quality setting does look reasonably good from what I've seen of it's handling some simple graphics.The printer is extremely fast, at least spitting out the pages themselves is; preping the print seems to take just as long as most others. Even if you want the printer to be connected wirelessly to your computer, Epson recommends you install it initially with a USB cable (not included). I had a printer from a discount chain store that cost one-tenth of this and was about as loud - but it had a scanner.This does have some nice features - as I said, the quality of the printing is good, it prints quickly, the ink cartridges are nice and big and the paper tray is huge which means less refilling. I once bought a spare printer just for the ink.Quality here is fine as well, even at these speeds. The printer comes with sufficient ink (black, cyan, magenta, and yellow cartridges) to handle 1000 pages black and 900 pages color, but extra-large carts are available to bring those numbers up to 2400 and 1200 respectively. Once the printer is properly configured, all other computers on the network will see it without difficulty. I installed the printer software under Mac OS 10.8.2 on a MacBook Pro, then made the connection with a USB cable, and quickly had the printer up and running. The printer is not particularly quiet, but there is a Quiet Mode (which helped a bit but slows things down a bit as well) if you are using this in the home office. Or would you prefer a single printer that can also copy, scan, and fax? We already have a Workforce Pro 4530 all in one printer that we have been extremely happy with. When looking for a second printer we wanted something similar with the convenience of compatible cartridges. The Workforce Pro 4020 is a great printer at the price, very similar in specifications to the top of the range all in one printers in the series. When we originally got the printer we were concerned about the speed and how many sheets it would print. The printer also supports Wi-fi Protected Setup for those who have and use the feature in their routers.When I first turned the printer on, it went through a 10+ minute long initialization process, during which it made all sorts of terrible noises. Next, I plugged in and powered on the printer. The printer started making a lot of clicking and grinding noises, which is common with Epson printers. I can attest to the printer's solid performance though. I haven't owned or used an Epson printer for over 15 years and I was a little anxious to see how The WorkForce Pro 4020 would perform as I have been using "all-in-one" printers for the past ten years and have been mostly satisfied with their performance. However, I was looking for a printer that would make two sided copies and print them faster than any of the all-in-one printers I have used previously. I still recommend having an all-in-one printer for scanning and faxing but use the WP-4020 as your main device for printing needs.The WP-4020 is a somewhat bulky and clumsy printer, approximately 18"x18", plain black and without much in the way of style or impressive user interface. This is a much bigger printer than I have ever had before, and as a result it would not fit in my computer desk in the designated printer space. The WP-4020 does not seem to have any of these issues.The printer has several different settings for changing output and printer features. If you are looking for a printer that is fast, easy and economical to use, then you should definitely consider purchasing the HP-4020 for your printing needs. This is a truly awesome printer. It included the printer, plug, 4 ink refills, and instructions with CD to upload its installation. After it's plugged in you are able to connect you PC to the printer via USB cable (not included) for installation. If you just need a printer that holds 300+ pages, then this one is good and simple to use. UPDATE 10/24/2012 :I originally gave this printer 5 stars and was initially very happy with it, but I discovered a SERIOUS issue that merits some attention. I have not yet tested the printer under similar conditions when connected via USB but considering the nature of the issue I expect it to behave as expected.Though a great printer for smaller jobs, it might be a little unreliable when sending larger document to it, particularly when using a wireless connection.My original review, unchanged, follows.------Epson is a standard name when it comes to designing inkjet printers and it is consistently near the top of the class when it comes to print quality and speed (that is especially true as of late - I had some troubles with them in the past). This is a bigger printer than I expected and as a result I needed to rearrange my workspace to make room for it. It's not a huge printer, but it's not small either and it's important to consider this when looking at this printer.Rather than simply put everything together and turn it on, I decided to try something very novel and I followed the directions that came with the printer. If you are looking for a printer that concentrates on just printing and doing it well, this is a fine choice and deserves a look. This printer is WiFi enabled, so laptops can print to it without the cords. This printer runs great,not one paper jam, it's very easy to use, does great qualityprinting and the inks really hold out. I super recommend thisEPSOM printer. This is a great printer. This is my first Epson since a Dot Matrix printer and I was not disappointed. A terrific printer at a great price---as many others have stated. The printer arrived in a big sturdy carton. The printer itself is about 18 x 16.5 x 11 inches in dimensions, weighs almost 30 pounds, and is ENERGY STAR qualified.Installation and set-up were quick and easy for both Mac and PC. This printer is a great color printer, however the size of it makes it less than ideal.
