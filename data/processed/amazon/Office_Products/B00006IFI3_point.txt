These are fine point permanent markers - which you likely know. They have the ultra fine point so that you can use them to clearly read something that needs to be permanent. I can barely see ball point ink on paper these days, and forget about pencil output. If you need a very fine point marker, or just a fine point pen, these are nice. I love the very fine point on these! I love the fine point. For that I use the Ultra-Fine Point Markers.Just like the fine point markers, these markers seem to last a long time if you take care to cap them as soon as you are finished with them. Hard to get all excited about the ultra fine point sharpie. I had some fine point sharpies on hand, but those were too thick for my needs; I needed something that wrote thinner like a pen, but smooth like a sharpie. The ultra fine point was just the ticket. Since I have been using these as opposed to fine point, my writing has been much clearer. It's just as permanent as the fine point, being waterproof, but it's still affected by the sun.
