This is a very handy product for light weight mounting. But this product was intended for things that are more compatible with its size and endurance.Highly recommended if you need this type of product. product only secures 1 or 2 pieces of paper. An outstanding product! I looked forward to using this product to help my very young daughters hang their artwork on their walls. interesting product, gets dirty, looses grip as expected, but is re usable, not forever though... This is a great product that takes the place of the mounting tape I used to buy to adhere posters/other artwork to my college dorm room walls. I tested this product by repeatedly affixing and removing one of the strips to my wall. This is an amazing product that seems to come in a long line of amazing adhesive products from various manufacturers (such as sticky notes and many others). There is a product for just about every creative job you have and this is a new one to have in your arsenal. This is a great product and I am in the process of removing all the magnets from my refrigerator and rehanging the artwork, etc. I've had this product for a couple of months now.
