Not having used the tape long enough to confirm the adhesive is  resistant to reduce yellowing, aging, and dry-out. I thought.It became apparent upon first setting the tape onto the serrated dispenser blade. You know how it is with tape. This is great tape in a handy dispenser. The tape is thick, sticky and very sturdy, and the dispenser is easy to use. This tape is great because you can always find the end and don't go crazy trying to unstick it from itself. I used this tape a lot for packing boxes, and for that purpose it worked really well, but with non cardboard items (or where the tape might have to stick to itself) it didn't do as well.PROS:EASE OF USE. Because the tape is less sticky, it is less noisy than other tapes.CONS:STICKINESS TO ITSELF. This tape is very easy to use and hassle free. Is the tape clear or blotchy? I like my normal tape gun just fine, but sometimes the tape threads incorrectly and it's a struggle to put things right as the tape sticks to itself and the gun. It lays down tape easily and cuts easily. The tape roll is replaceable. I think I'll keep using this instead of the tape gun. If the tape is permitted to fall back in place, touching the roll, it will have to be started again, and this could lead to the same problem just described.One other potential problem with this tape is its overall strength. With other, stronger tape, the tape is strong enough and the adhesive sticky enough that the tape can be used for a multitude of purposes. This tape can only be used for its intended purpose and little else.Henkel EZ Start Carton Sealing Tape with Dispenser is, overall, a good product and it does succeed at its main purpose, which is using it for packing and sealing boxes. However, I thought the tape seemed more prone to wrinkle instead of lying flat when I used it. This tape is very similar to other packing tape products I've used (3M, Scotch, etc.). I don't usually like shipping tape in a dispenser... they always gum up and I lose the end, causing, well, frustration! AND the tape works great!! This is wonderful packing tape! The Duck EZ Start tape is very convenient to use. They waste less tape by being more precise at tearing, work just as well for home use and are safer--no more bloody hands!The tape itself is easy to find and start when stuck to itself on the roll. The Duck EZ Start tape is good quality and rivals other quality brands.In the product details, the dispenser is described as disposable but don't throw it away! I loved this tape the first time I used it, but I've waited to write this review until I had used it enough to confirm my first impression. Because th tape comes off the roll virtually silently, you won't get evil glares from across the office if you use it at your work station.I haven't had it long enough to see whether the claims about non-yellowing hold up, but honestly I don't really care. No tape splitting. I was skeptical to say the least since I thought I needed a tape gun, a huge roll, etc... but the reviews were so good that I tried it, for $3.99 what did I have to loose. It works so much better than the tape dispenser and gun I had, stores away easier and the tape is a really good quality tape.I'm very impressed, extremely impressed due to the size and price that it works so well. The tape worked well enough to seal packages for mailing--the roll started easily, unrolled easily, and cut easily on the dispenser. I've used Duck tape many times over the years and am still very happy with it. Cheap tape gets stuck to the roll and is often near impossible to get it started again; picking, tearing, splitting down the center. But this Duck tape is thick and strong, so it's easy to peel it up off the roll if the end slips off the holder. And since the tape is thick and strong, there's no need to waste tape by adding extra layers, like I have to do with cheapo brands. Yes, I said the tape is quiet. When you pull this tape off the roll it doesn't make that rather loud sound [you know, the sound that wakes the sleeping baby just after you finally got her to sleep] that other packing tapes make. The tape's manufacturer also claims that the tape won't yellow over time. I haven't had the tape long enough to see if that claim is true, but I also haven't had any issues with my usual brand of packing tape yellowing.In short, it's a decent packing tape. As far as I can tell, the tape and dispenser are identical to Scotch packaging tape, which means it's a great product. The tape dispenser is easy to use when sealing cartons. The tape seems strong enough and not thin and cheap. This tape is good enough to repair torn paper or boxes and for pulling pet hair off of clothes too. This is high-quality moving tape. So, while this is high-quality tape, I would definitely only buy it in a much larger roll. You do have to thread the tape, and pull out an inch or two by hand to get it started.The five stars are simply because the tape roles like a dream with no quack squeak, "uh oh the baby is awake". This tape is very good for packing boxes - I used most of it to pack boxes that I used to ship items from eBay sales, etc.The tape was easy to rip, had a strong hold on the packages, and didn't get your hands all messy like some of the other tape on the market. Also, I've used tape that smells horrible - this one really has no odor.All in all, a solid packing tape. I don't know how they did it, but this tape is absolutely silent! This has 1/2 the tape of 3m/scotch available at sams club. I mean VERY LITTLE tape actually exists on this dispenser Enter Duck tape! All in all the Henkel tape dispenser would get 10 stars and the other types 3 stars. Will be buying this tape from now on. Don't you hate packing tape that either tears unevenly, or gets stuck together so you can't find the beginning of the roll? This tape is wonderful; it does what packing tape is supposed to do:  dispense clear, easy-to-use tape. Doesn't matter, this tape is the one to buy. It seems to be just as strong as ordinary tape but it does have a brittleness missing from the regular packing tapes. I didn't have to Duck, but we were out of packing tape and I kept forgetting to pick some up at a store. After ordering this on Amazon, I had the clear tape in my hand within two days and for a price just as good as I could've had locally.The tape is easy to pull with an end that's easily located. I especially like that the tape dispenses quietly in case I want to get a package ready while Mrs. Spudman is asleep.Bottom line - This is a good-performing product for a good price that is delivered right to your door. The EZ tape rolls off the roll almost effortly---so much so, that you may have to find ways to slow it down with some professional dispensers (an easy adjustment with most).Since the TSA may confiscate scissors a 2"-core roll (without the dispenser) can be useful for light packaging when traveling. I'm sure if I were purchasing tape at Christmas, I would want a longer roll, but for general use, it is perfectly fine tape. I found this tape and it's dispenser easy to use. The tape easily slips out of the guide in the dispenser, then gets stuck to itself, then tears when I try to unstick it. The tape dispensed easily, although it didn't tear on the teeth as cleanly. Excellent tape, easy to start, never sticks to itself, very thick, high grade. It's hard to review tape - tape is tape, right? This tape never splits on me & is nice and thick.
