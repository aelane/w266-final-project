This caddy offers one option. The caddy is handy for the markers so that you can keep track of them. They're very handy.The caddy is great too. I like this little caddy but can't say I love it. The caddy seems needlessly bulky and takes up too much of my writing space when I attach it to the 2&#8217; x 3&#8217; dry-erase board that I have in my kitchen. Very important.Unfortunately, the caddy didn&#8217;t fit on my whiteboard. Potentially, for some, yes (maybe not necessarily for all,) but then again&#8230;.it all depends on if you want to attach the caddy to the dry erase board. However, the caddy is basically a waste -- it's so heavy that it unbalances my whiteboard, and the way it's designed there's no way to stand it up on its own. Additionally, the caddy doesn't even really hold the eraser -- if it's tipped even the slightest bit in any direction, the eraser falls out. The caddy is needlessly bulky and is designed to only work with one specific board. The caddy is about 2 - 3 inches thick and heavy. I would have liked to be able to attach the caddy because it is a convenient holder but I guess I would need to get their particular board to do that.
