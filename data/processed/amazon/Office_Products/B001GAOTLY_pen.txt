Anything official cannot be signed with an erasable pen. I went through a whole pen in just about 10 days and these are pricey at two buckaroos a piece at an office store so buying in bulk seems to help a bit but not that much. Significantly different from an ordinary pen, when you rub the writing with the back end of this pen, it creates heat which erases the mark.In my case I scan my writings a few days after I make them, and discard the original. Enter this pen! Considering they run nearly $2 per pen, thats pretty pricey; particularly when you write 50+ pages a week like I do.Overall: these are bar-none the BEST erasable pens on the market. These are my preferred pen for class now! I honestly didn't expect much from an erasable pen but I forgot this was a Pilot. This is great if you like using a pen, and if you're like me and make mistakes constantly it's fantastic, because now you can erase rather than scratching out, which really makes an essay look messy when you've scratched out half the page.This is also great during tests if you're required to use a pen (sometimes they require that so you can't erase... keep that in mind. An erasable pen is handy, particularly for any creative processes where ongoing changes are involved, like composing, designing, sketching, or drafting.

Sometimes the pen would erase fine, sometimes it would leave ink residue, sometimes it would smear the ink all over the area I was erasing, and sometimes it would rub a hole into the paper.I gave up on using erasable pens until I heard about these.

The pen has a rubberized eraser that uses friction to remove the ink.

So this pen will write and erase until the ink is gone!The pens are not refillable.
