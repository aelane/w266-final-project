The folder itself is an extra solid cardboard that never bends. When you handle them you can see how strongly reinforced the folder is to the metal rod. The folder is not going to tear no matter what. And now I also need less because I can put more into each folder. I have not found a better folder than Pendaflex and these are the best I have seen. Also, the folder does not bend as easily, thus maintaining the correct shape, and not spilling a full folder into the drawer as easily as before. The folder's top edges are thicker which I have found makes sorting and separating one folder from the next easier than other folders I've used. The folder hanging hook is made of a firm yet flexible plastic material. Also, the folder tabs require you to configure your word processor 'just right' to print them. However, to accomplish this, the folder itself takes up more space. This will extend each folder's useful life.
