See Note 1 for Canon ink details. )The ink refills (240 and 241 series) include a chip and the actual print heads. They drop your ink cost to 1/10 or 1/30 of Canon cost.

For those curious about ink quality and durability, this printer uses Chromalife 100 dye based inks. Chromalife 100 is a somewhat older ink formulation that produces average prints. The newer 100+ ink is found on the Canon MG5320 and models above. So, the ink cartridge is more expensive than others without printer head.5. Canon's ink cartridge has a chip to discourage 3rd party ink refills. The ink cartridge includes printer head. They aren't colored in with white ink, which means they're REALLY hard to see, especially if the printer is in a dimly lit room or if there's a glare on the surface.Overall, I'm going to continue using my C4795 as my primary printer, and I can't really recommend this printer to most people. The ink costs more than what I paid for the printer. The old ink problem raises its costly head again. The ink lasts as long as most inject printers.Overall, Im happy with a printer that is easy to setup and simply works.
