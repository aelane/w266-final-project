They have flowed through the printer without a hitch. Naturally, more a durable printer does better.If you need the smaller size, try3M Permanent Adhesive Shipping Labels, 1/2" X 1 3/4"  Inches White, Laser, 2000 labels per pack (3100-Q).Periodically, I will write on a label, attach to a surface for reminder. They aligned nicely in our printer and adhered well to our packages. My printer, which is a little persnickety sometimes, handled the sheet just fine. I used them with my HP All-in-one printer and had no issues at all. It also seemed to work well in the printer. Printed perfectly again.My printer is an inkjet, and after a minute or two, the ink was dry with no smears. The 3M Labels recommend using either the Avery 5163 or 3M 3100-S printer templates these templates are available with most standard word or print shop program. Even if my printer is warm, these do not do that and are always easy to peel off of the sheet. I have a very very old HP printer. I have a new all-in-one printer and send out a package or two each week. You don't even need a printer -- you can just write on them with permanent marker, so the address stands out on the package.I haven't had the need, but I think you could even use them for name tags too.

They fed well through my HP Laser printer, they didn't smear after being printed, and they stuck well to my packages.

They use the same printer template as the other brand, #5163 and I didn't have any problem with them printing off the label.I tend to print individual labels and sent the sheet through 10 times with little difficulty.

Oh, and they didn't get stuck in my printer, either.Not only do I use these labels for domestic packages, but also international packages.
