If you are looking for a solid printer for about 90 bucks, this will do the job. Since we turn off the printer before leaving our work, this option works well for us.Pretty much everything this printer does, it does well.Why did I dock a star?Because setup was such a schlep. Before getting this printer, I did not know that they made printer/copier/fax/scanner multifunctional machines for personal use &#8211; I had always associated their name with the demands of small- or medium-sized businesses. As for using the printer, the print quality seems sharp. I wanted this printer to use for my office. Nice printer This is a solid printer. When I ordered the printer for review, it said that it was wireless. I would think even a printer novice would be able to get this machine up and running to their needs within no time at all, and it is perfect for either a home, or small business user.I have been using this for about a month now with no problems whatsoever.

The printer is very fast (25 ppm) and the product is crisp and clean.

This printer likes to go to Power Save mode almost instantly, meaning that startup times can be stuttery.
