Also the colors are useful in organizing related files topically. The bright colors are a nice alternative to the boring manila coloryou normally see. and find the varied colors and large labels useful for that purpose.These are just file folders, but as those come, they are pretty nice. I like having them in different colors for my various categories, and the large tabs are easily read. The mixed colors are valuable if you want to categorize your folders using a color code - plus they are more attractive to look at than the standard beige. They definitely are pastel colors, and not really the best for an office setting. It is nice to have colors no one else really does.I do also like the larger label area. Some of the colors are nice, but I think I actually like traditional folders better. They are fairly sturdy and I like the bright colors for easy sorting. The bright colors make them almost fun to use. I like the bright colors, because they aid in filing things into different categories. They are definitely feminine colors - pastels. I wish I had the colors when I was teaching. The colors are awesome for color-coding, and the tabs are big enough to write in (I have no patience for doing this kind of thing on a computer) and they hold a decent amount of paper. See attached picture.The colors are nice but what appears to be orange in the photo is really a dark manilla color.The folders are nice overall but I wouldn't recommend them based on the larger tab size alone because for my use they aren't that helpful because I have to move the paper inside to see the bottom half of the tab.

For me the colors are more useful for location and filing than are the tabs, whether regular tabs or the super sized tabs.

The different colors are excellent, visible cues to different categories of your pertinent information.

The bright colors stand out in our crowded file drawers.
