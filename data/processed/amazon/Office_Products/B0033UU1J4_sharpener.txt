This sharpener does not sharpen well. Unfortunately, this leads to the sharpener to stop, forcing you to take the pencil out and reinsert it again to resume sharpening. Our previous sharpener at work, you had to really push the pencil in there to get it to work. Another electric sharpener that I have used for a few years with some success is an X-Acto sharpenerX-Acto Electric Pencil Sharpener (1818)and the Bostich is probably the highest rated one for the price range atStanley Bostitch QuietSharp6(TM) Classroom Pencil Sharpener With 6-holes And Quiet Motor, Blue (EPS10HC) I don't know what happened with the sharpener that other reviewers got, but this one is great. If the sharpener ever tipped over, all of the shavings would fall out all over the place.I timed how long this sharpener took to sharpen a brand-new pencil. I do love this sharpener! The sharpener is light weight, so it doesn't necessarily stay put on my desk. The sharpener includes a small wall wart AC adapter. A really good sharpener will leave the exposed wood smooth, and it will have a nice long exposed point. Unfortunately, this sharpener leaves the wood slightly rough, like wood that was sanded with 60 grit sandpaper. This sharpener is supposed to automatically turn off when the tip is sharpened. I had to finish that one with the manual sharpener as well. All in all, the manual sharpener I have works much better and is much easier to clean. I've been using this sharpener in my middle school classroom for about 3 weeks now and it has held up great so far. This sharpener makes wonderfully sharp pencils. Regardless, I'm happy to have it so that we now have a sharpener upstairs as well as down. The sharpener automatically stops on its own. The sharpener is clear so you know when to empty it. Pressing down gently will activate the sharpener, which will automatically stop when the pencil is sharp. The sharpener doesn't sharpen the pencil to as fine a point as other sharpeners I've had, but I like that as the pencils are less likely to break. The sharpener is also quieter than I'm used to.The shavings collect in the clear top portion, the very top of which is a screw-on/off lid. It takes seconds.The only draw back to the sharpener is the sensor it uses to determine when a pencil is sharp enough. The sharpener creates an uneven point (the wood comes up higher on one side) and doesn't create an ultra-fine point. This sharpener does everything right. So, to me, this sharpener is a waste of money.Natalie S. for Amazon Vine I love this little sharpener. My old sharpener didn't have the power to do a good job and always left one side unsharpened. I would not recommend this sharpener for classroom use. The sharpener's vertical design does save a little counter space. I was excited to try this sharpener out because I know the teachers at my children's school need good pencil sharpeners all the time.I decided to compare it to the old school, classic 1980s era sharpener that I found at a thrift store. If you must buy a new sharpener, this one will be ok but not great. Then, the sharpener stops after just a couple of seconds, even though barely any wood has been trimmed away. The sharpener is the best design that I've ever seen. Be warned that this sharpener is not adjustable, i.e. After trying out the sharpener on a couple dozen pencils, it was time to empty the shavings. I couldn't find one universally well-liked and I ended up getting a Bostitch electric sharpener. I did notice that this sharpener doesn't sound or seem as sturdy as my other, but it's been holding up just fine.
