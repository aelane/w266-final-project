I reuse boxes all the time and these make it easy to repack while preserving the integrity of the box. These are great if you want to reuse boxes. I already use used boxes for shipping items but sometimes the box can be damaged when trying to remove other labels. I even use it for new boxes. If you have boxes that you would like to reuse but they need a little TLC, these labels will work great. They make reusing boxes less tacky. Re-using old boxes with labels and barcodes is no problem. If you re-use Amazon boxes (or other stores' boxes, if you're not so loyal as to only order from Amazon), you'll appreciate the convenience of not having to painstakingly peel up labels from nearly every side of the box (seriously, how many barcodes do they need to get a package to my address?). Iam always looking to reuse and recycle what I can, including reusing boxes when I can.These shipping labels comes in a package of 50 labels, 2 to a page. I guess you could also use these on white boxes too, it just wouldn't look as seamless.They do offer these same labels in the same size, but in white, if you do want to match the color of the label to the color of the box.These labels can be used in either an inkjet printer, or a laser printer, or you could even write on them by hand. I generally reuse boxes (often from Amazon) because I try to keep my shipping costs as low as possible and boxes can be expensive. I use these when I need to address boxes being shipped around the country. If you are concerned with your boxes looking "ugly" when reusing them, try going into the paint section of your local Wally World and buying a roll of the brown paper you are supposed to lay down when painting. You can rewrap your boxes with this and have that "pretty" box that some are going for using these labels.

Use all those reusable boxes again ... the brown paper matches most boxes and doesn't make a person come across as stingy ... just maybe frugal (ha-ha).

I save shipping boxes and I do reuse them.

This is useful if you reuse boxes that have become peppered with random labels and markings.
