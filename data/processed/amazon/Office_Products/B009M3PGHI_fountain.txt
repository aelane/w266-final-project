(Oriental fountain pens tend to write narrower strokes, so I was expecting that this medium nib will write more like a western nib rated "Fine". If you are looking for a basic fountain pen for any reason, I highly recommend this. If you're looking for your first fountain pen, this is an awesome selection. I have been very pleased with this Pilot fountain pen. I have never owned a fountain pen in my life. I have been using the Pilot Metropolitan fountain pen for a few weeks now. I have used fountain pens that put down so much ink, you have to wait and wait ... and be very careful ... not to smear writing because the words were not dry. Cheaper fountain pens might leak if stored horizontally, but that has not happened with the Metropolitan.Lightweight and comfortable to hold: I found the Metropolitan looked a bit chubby, but it is very lightweight and it is comfortable to hold while writing.Cons:No good for any sort of multi-part forms: These days, one rarely comes across multi-part forms any more, such as NCR paper or even (yes, it STILL exists) carbon paper forms. I have owned several other fountain pens and didn't think I was a complete philistine, but I guess I just couldn't figure it out.

I haven't used a fountain pen in over forty years, so this was a fairly new experience for me.

Because I use a fountain pen all the time for jotting down notes, making sketches and just doodling while working on my word processor--in addition to thank-you notes--, it is in almost constant use.

As a fountain pen lover, the Pilot is not one that I thought I'd find especially endearing.
