Sometimes you just need to find a new sheet but don't want to remove the top sheet. This is a tear-off sheet, just like the regular bonded note pads that distribute single pages. You don't have to rip off the top sheet like you usually do, you can choose a different size from a different part of the pad while keeping the pad intact. They've even made it possible to tear a sheet from any of the pads without breaking the whole thing apart.Sticky notes are items that most of us use and take for granted and it's nice to see that Avery continues to innovate and make them more convenient and attractive than ever. Sometimes, the whole sheet tears out with the perforated part still attached at the top and it's awkward to tear it off without using two hands. Because there is backing beneath the bottom sheet of each size, the sizes don't stick to one another, and you can pull off a sheet of whichever size you prefer.The only downside to this is the very top stack. If I don't pull off the sheet I need before writing on it, I've noticed that the movement of my wrist sometimes causes the ends of the bottom colors (pink and blue) to curl up, and that's a bit of a problem. If I need a longer sheet for a list I use the right size and it works perfectly and they stay where I put them.MUCH better than having stacks stuffed everywhere and the different colors helps if you need to organize different notes on a file you are working on. I couldn't imagine it would be easy to tear out a middle sheet without tearing the paper or ripping apart the pad.I was wrong.This pad is wonderful.

It is VERY easy to remove a sheet from whatever size you desire without compromising the entire pad.

Thus, you have to be careful in separating a sheet off the pad.

I just want to whip a sheet off the pad and stick the note somewhere.
