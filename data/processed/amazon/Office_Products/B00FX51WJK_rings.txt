Although I prefer the D rings, these round ones open easily and close securely. I happen to prefer the &#8220;D&#8221; shaped rings, which Wilson Jones also offer. D rings, to me, are a definite plus, as they help store paper more easily, and allow pages to be flipped more freely. These snap together nicely, although on the one I got one of the rings was ever-so-slightly misaligned. The rings work well. The D rings have to be carefully put over them by hand &#8230; a real pain.This binder is perfect, especially if you will be using it numerous times on a regular basis. The rings are D shaped to hold paper more easily and better. First, the rings are attached to the back of the binder rather than at the spine. The rings open and close easily (via one push lever at the bottom of the binder) exactly as they should. I love that the rings open so easily, and the multiple pockets really helps you stay organized. The rings are one-touch and easy to lock and unlock. The rings are very solid and the clear pockets showcase your work nicely.I have no complaints about this "Ultra Duty" binder. The rings also close tightly, but pages sometimes get caught on them while being turned. The rings are easy to open and close with just one hand. Finally, I love that the rings are mounted on the back cover rather than on the spine so that my pages stay nice and flat while in use. I was amazed at how easy it was to open the rings with one finger pushing the lever at the base of the ring strip. The rings close tightly so pages turn smoothly and pages won't be falling out.

The rings open easily and smoothly.

It truly is very easy to open the rings (a lot easier than binders I've used in the past).
