Once I did all I could like that, I plugged in the machine and turned it on which automatically engages the wheel to start turning. The machine works perfectly again!So the moral of this story is: don't make the mistake I did-- but if you do, it is fixable!Because the laminator can stand up to this sort of user error and still works really well, it earns five stars from me. It was very easy to pull it out of the machine, though I did ruin the drawing (got all crinkled up inside the laminator). After receiving this wonderful machine, I'll need no more trips to the store to have larger projects protected. The machine has a lever on the rear for instant release and removal of the document. Yes, that machine was extremely wide, but that also lent itself to much wasted clear material when used for smaller pages. This Fellowes machine allows my small office to preserve and protect documents and I personally love it for laminating counted cross stitch patterns which I can keep in a binder for each project, marking the pages as the stitches are completed. I recommend this machine for a home or small business needing more than an occasional lamination. I really found this machine to be a valuable resource to my small business. There wasn't too much I did not like about this machine, as I never utilized a laminating machine before, and I never had the desire to do so before now. I will say, however, the machine is a bit loud. This machine worked like a charm. I love this machine. The machine is relatively narrow so it doesn't take up a lot of space.

It was an expensive and efficient machine, but on this smaller scale, I'm actually more impressed with the Fellowes Saturn laminator.It is small and light, which is great for putting it in tight spaces and carrying and storing it where you must.

This machine is very easy to set up, very easy to use and can handle average size jobs.

However the machine can also do cold lamination as well.
