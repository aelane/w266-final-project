I love this stapler. This is a great stapler at a great price! I'm such a stapler snob. I took this stapler to work where we have to staple on a daily basis and I was able to staple one-handed without much effort whatsoever. If you prefer a stapler that staples tough with minimal effort, go with Swingline SmartTouch Stapler. I really wanted to like this stapler. But when I tried to close the stapler, the bar wouldn't move. I just can't recommend this stapler. I finally realized it was upside down and got the stapler loaded and permanently stapled that flopping piece of plastic. Now the stapler is fully assembled and works properly. So, if you want a solid stapler that is easy to use and is a great value, financially, this is for you. I absolutely adore this stapler, and ever since I got it, my usual stapler, also by swingline but not part of this reduced effort line, has set unused and unloved in my desk drawer. My old stapler makes a great kerthunk sound, and since I have a very young baby, anything that allows me to work more quietly is a great big plus.The one thing that I don't like about this stapler, is that it usually takes me multiple tries to get my sheaf of papers into that little opening between stapler and the bottom of the stapler. They say that you can use the stapler for 25 sheets of paper, but you have to be extremely careful feeding a stack of 25 sheets into this thing, because it's just got a very small, insufficient opening for sliding the papers in. They are really not that much more expensive, and if you use them, then I think you'll find that this stapler works just fine. Stapling with this stapler is very "smooth". I have a different Swingline stapler, which is much heavier, louder, and takes more pressure to use. I prefer to "grip" the stapler when I use it. By I prefer to have the stapler "standing" and not flat on the desk. Though this stapler will stand, it doesn't stand very well, and will easily tip-over. I loved using this stapler, but breaking so quickly makes me drop my rating a ton.Staplers aren't supposed to be noticed. Refilling the stapler is easy, and I haven't had any problems with that either.It's probably because I have only had super cheap, old-fashioned staplers my whole life, but I love this. The stapler doesn't sit very solidly on a flat surface due to it's shape. The SmartTouch stapler will staple 25 sheets of 20 lb. To load the stapler you push down the little lever at the back of the stapler and pull out the staple tray up front. Great stapler. The stapler very easily staples through as many as 25 sheets.The stapler is well designed, and feels very sturdy, with a nice (but not too much) weight to it. This stapler has a very smooth, effortless action. If you've ever owned a stapler before, its the same. You can't open it out flat, but if that isn't important to you, this stapler is more than sufficient. This Swingline full-strip stapler is so much easier to use than a traditional stapler! I really like this stapler, it's got some heft to it. The stapler also came with a sample pack of Swingline's S.F.4 Premium staples - which I thought were much better than the generic brand staples I've been buying from one of the local big-box office supply store. I've always been a Swingline stapler fan, and this is a nice addition to our collection. Everything about this stapler is streamlined, from looks to staple loading. This is a great stapler. This is a nice stapler for medium-size documents. If you keep the stapler partially depressed after you've stapled your stack, the next staple doesn't move forward. The stapler's extra lever at the top compresses over the unit to push staples through thick stacks with no more effort required than your Grandma (with her arthritic hands) might need to expend to get the staples through easily and securely. The stapler also can comfortably stand and balance on its end. I was very frustrated when I first opened this stapler and tried loading it. I really like this stapler, and it is a GREAT deal at under $10. Hard.The stapler doesn't use the traditional loading mechanism that requires you to pry the stapler open to load staples; You simply push a button. Beautifully.Aesthetically, this stapler is a thing of beauty. I've had this stapler for a month now, and overall i like it. Excellent stapler. This stapler does not open flat vertically for stapling documents onto, say, a bulletin board, but it makes a very good desktop or handheld stapler. First off I will admit that the stapler does live up to it's claim and doesn't require much effort in order to staple even when doing 25 pages.
