I had an earlier PIXMA printer. However, when I specified that the printer control the printing process, it printed my cards very nicely. This printer will fill in the gaps and print all kinds of photo variations. Extricating the printer from its box was par for the course, with the usual removal of protective wrapping and unsticking of orange tape.The printer itself weighs in at 20 lbs, so it is somewhat more hefty than it looks and it is by no means petite at 18.6 x 14.5 x 6.9 inches. On Windows, the printer is picked up and is automatically added with a click. You can now switch easily between printer and scanner without any errors.OTHER FEATURES:There are numerous slots for media cards and a place to connect a thumb drive or device via USB. )The printer is also capable of printing without being attached to a computer. The printer can even print PDF files from a USB drive without access to a computer--a really nice touch.SUMMARY:This is a capable and easy to use all-in-one that would work well as a home printer. This rendered the printer useless (not even the scanning function will work with unrecognized cartridges).I ran out to 3 separate brick and mortar stores for OEM replacement cartridges--these cartridges are new and none of the stores had the full complement of cartridges. I purchased this printer the end of Oct. 2010; I didn't set it up right away & didn't use it for 6 weeks when I was out of state. This printer doesn't have a draft choice. I've never, ever had a printer use ink so quickly.Other than gobbling ink, the printer is good; however, I've owned better printers. I never owned a printer that was quite this slow; the slowness doesn't bother me; I can live with it, just thought I'd mention it. This printer has some nice features, my star rating will remain the same because of ink usage.Yet another update: When I get the message 'Printer may be out of ink', I press OK & my text document usually prints. Anyway, I connected the printer to my desktop (not the laptop I was mentioning) with the USB cord and it went fine. But it wasn't the printer's weakness, but the person who made that decision.Another issue I have is that the paper cassette doesn't hold a lot of paper. After getting this printer set up, including printing the alignment page, I tested the copier function by copying a document with a little bit of color to see how it would come out. This printer and scanner works flawlessly. I was initially terrified about setting up the WiFi on it, but that proves shockingly simple as well.The printer looks nice, fits well on a typical printer station, and it stable.

The printer lasted until January 7, 2014--essentially 4 years and about 3 months.The problem is something called a B200 error.

However, up until January 7, 2014 the printer worked perfectly--I even just bought a set of new cartridges for it...

The printer that I am comparing this model to, is my old Canon MX310[Canon Pixma MX310 Office All-in-One Inkjet Printer (2184B002)], bought from Amazon circa 2007.WHAT'S IN THE BOX:The printer is packaged with a quick start up guide, network trouble shooting guide, a starter pack of 6 ink cartridges, power cord, paper for print head alignment, and sample pack of 4 X 6 Canon Plus Glossy II photo paper.
