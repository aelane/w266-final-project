The toner replacements are not cheap. Even the toner saver option produces documents with decent contrast. Inexpensive toner. It was also wildly popular because of a neat toner trick to get it to print more pages out of the toner, even when the printer claimed the toner needed replacing. Brother also decided to get cheap and included a starter toner rated for only 700 pages, whereas the 2170W was 1000 pages or 2 full reams of paper. I'm now a pro at re-loading them with toner which is by far the cheaper way to do it. It was upsetting that the first toner that came with the printer ran out very very fast. Super easy to set up and also easy to change the toner cartridge. The toner cartridges for this printer (TN-450) have much less capacity than the 5370, making it much more expensive to maintain. When replacing the toner cartridge, which the original cartridge lasted far longer than I expected, I went with a generic replacement. Thier toner and ink is price so you dont need to make six figures to print. )The toner light should be off. Heck, the toner costs almost 50% of the price of the machine for the high yield one and if the drum ever went bad, it would probably be cheaper to buy the next level down in this printer family to get a new drum and starter cartridge.HP may have invented the laser printer and did most of the research but companies like Brother have come storming on board with quality and inexpensive products. The toner cartridge is still replaced separately from the drum, so saving money.
