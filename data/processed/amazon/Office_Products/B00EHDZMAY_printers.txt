I have been using Canon printers exclusively for many years now. It is wider than most printers and you might need some more space on the desk for it. It also feels flimsier than other printers. I have used Cannon printers for years. Not as sharp as you would good from other high-end larger printers but the results were good enough to satisfy my needs. I've had Canon printers in the past, (Canon PIXMA MG3120 Wireless Inkjet Photo All-In-One (5289B019)) and while I really liked it, the replacement cartridges were really costly. We have tested a LOT of printers - and at one point or another, we have owned every brand of printer.I really wanted the MG7120 because I loved the last Canon PIXMA I owned. The MX922/MX892 printers have an ADF.- No straight paper path. I have set up printers, etc. My other Canon printers have transparent ink cartridges which makes it easy to see when the cartridge really is out of ink and needs to be replace. I have several printers for printing documents, web pages, etc.
