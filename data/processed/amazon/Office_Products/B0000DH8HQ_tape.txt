Scotch tape is pretty much a standard in my house for a zillion uses. Scotch Magic Tape is he best tape I used so far. You probably know all about this tape --after all, it is the tape standard; it's the one you've probably used your whole life, and one that you purchase without thinking. Although it goes on relatively clear, it is NOT really the "Magic" tape that it claims to be -it shouldn't be used for wrapping presents where you really want the tape to disappear completely. (THAT tape is what I use when I am giving gifts to those who are not family members! The "magic" tape, however, is less sticky and in some cases can be removed easily -even from wrapping paper- hence its overall verasatility and suitability for everyday use. )What I didn't like:Well, I thought that there wasn't enough tape on the rolls. This tape is excellent, it is invisible after application. I don't really have much to say -- I think Scotch tape has a pretty well-established reputation.Put simply, it's the standard for office / home-office tape. I use this tape for all sorts of stuff -- from office tasks to wrapping presents to little home projects.This is your general-purpose office tape. What can I say about this tape other than it works really well? The tape itself is their "magic tape", which is the invisible kind. And if you need to, you can write on the tape (with markers, pens, and even pencils) and it won't smudge.I'd definitely recommend this for any of your taping needs. This tape is hi quality, invisible after application, easy to used, it will not tear before use or get messy,  never have lost ends and it will stay in the place you used it. There isn't much to say about the tape itself; it is high quality and works well, as anyone would expect of this well-known brand.The refillable dispensers are of much higher quality than is found in the disposable pack. I like this tape because the matte finish disappears when you place it on wrapping paper with a matte finish. This tape tears off easily, unlike the other varieties of Scotch tape that have a shiny finish. I typically find that this tape can also be repositioned (depending on the surface you apply it to) within a few seconds if you don't get the placement just right on the first try. I also like that you can write on this tape. Not all tape have a surface that is conducive to being written upon, but this one does and that's a bonus as far as I'm concerned. This tape certainly gets my recommendation. Been using Scotch-brand tape since I was a kid. The green-label "matte finish" tape seems to be a little better quality than the red-label regular Scotch tape. Scotch Magic tape is a great product.It tears easily from the provided dispenser and holds well to whatever you stick it to.Very easy to remove without splitting apart.This works wonderfully for most paper projects and for closing plastic bags.Not the best choice for most gift wrapping as the matte finish actually shows on glossy paper, or rather you see a dull spot where the tape is.A great product that is always consistently, dependable, and the price from Amazon beats our local stores by nearly 2 bucks per roll! Scotch tape is reliable. This tape does just what it's supposed to.And with this pack you get much more for your money! Scotch tape is just all around great tape - this 6 pack of Scotch Magic Office Tape (which just happen to come in refillable dispensers, my favorite!) Reviewing Scotch tape is like reviewing Kleenex, or Coca-Cola. (Still want more tape, though)] The tape was really good quality and I thought the price was good. I don't use scotch tape often so this will last me a couple of years. I have loved Magic tape forever and in addition to the usual uses like wrapping presents where the invisibility of the tape makes the finished product so sharp that I have been complemented! I only intend to use this tape only on paper; for that purpose, it is good. The tape is matte, which I know, but I was hoping that it would be clearer. Very often, tape dispensers have prongs, making it difficult to remove/replace spools of tape. Finally, smooth out the tape with your fingernail and voila! The tape also releases well from walls and other surfaces without a residue so is great for temporary posting. Scotch tape is the best I've used so there is nothing to say there.The dispensers are good.For a desk, I would prefer a nicer heavier dispenser, but for putting them around the house or classroom they are fine and it's not big deal if they get lost. It's tape...and several rolls of it. Excellent all purpose tape by scotch tape. My preferred tape for any paper use, able to be written upon, and withstands the test of time. The best tape for your money by far. We normally buy the cheapest tape you can get at Office Max or Staples, but I still prefer the Scotch brand tape.T
