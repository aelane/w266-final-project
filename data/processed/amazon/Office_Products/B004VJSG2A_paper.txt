They stick on well, remove easily without marring the paper, and come in bright, easy to spot, cheerful colors. The paper is smooth, takes pencil well and erases cleanly. The paper these tags are made of is slightly translucent, so there's a bit of show-through of text underneath them. Because these are made of paper, your annotations will never smudge.The best way to think of this product is as a regular set of sticky notes that has been chopped down to half inch slices for your page marking pleasure. I love Avery paper products. These are paper, and easy to write notes on; they can only be repositioned once or twice at the most.Avery also makes a translucent plastic flag with a stronger adhesive for a longer lasting page bond;Avery Flags, 0.5 Inch, Standard Colors, 100 Flags (22569)These are another favorite that I tend to leave in books long-term. I used them on both plain paper printouts and in various texts. You still have to be careful on some paper sourses like extremely thin paper, but most paper it works well. Because these are made of paper but use the same adhesive as the plastic page markers and flags, I can reuse them the same amount of times but worry less about throwing away a small piece of paper (or better yet, recycling it!). These paper page markers from Avery are handy for bookmarking. The paper is easy to write on and they can be repositioned easily.

The paper they are made of allows you to make notes on them.

These colorful paper page markers or "flags" are the sort of office supply that quietly insinuates itself into your life.

They are paper and not to be confused with the Post-it brand page flags which are plastic (and about 2-3X more expensive).These page markers, made out of 1/2" slices of Post-it like paper, come in 5 pads of 50 markers each in 5 colors.
