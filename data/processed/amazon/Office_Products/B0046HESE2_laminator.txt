This laminator has a rather steep learning curve. Our old (and dead) laminator was able to laminate long, poster size items, but so far, it seems that this one cannot. The Fellowes Titan 125 Laminator is a real heavy-duty laminator designed best for offices or businesses. If you're looking for a laminator for your home or occasional use, the Titan 125 will be complete overkill. The Titan is a Big and heavy laminator it was easy to operate heats up quickly and is very fast with excellent results. I think this will be a good laminator for a school or office not for home use, only if you have space to put this big laminator, good quality and performance I highly recommended. The laminator is great, it is intuitive and easy to set up and get straight to work. The laminator gets hot on the back panel, be careful, give it plenty of air circulation around the unit.Warning - Don't laminate your sonogram. When I picked up this laminator, I thought, "Why would we need this thing?" Using the included letter-sized laminator sleeves, I laminated a couple of drawings made by my son, and was very pleased with the output. When looking at the laminator, there is no visual indicator to tell whether it is "off" or in "standby" (and no sound either). It's the first laminator I have used and it's definitely powerful and built to last. I am very excited about how well this laminator works. So far, this laminator done an excellent job on everything I've fed through it.
