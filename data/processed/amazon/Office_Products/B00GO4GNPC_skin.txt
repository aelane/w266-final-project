Eventually, I selected the skin for my alma mater and ordered it. The skin I ordered took just under a week to come, and now my new stapler is now resplendent in its Acadia National Park sunset scene. The skin includes little strips for the side panels on the stapler and all three pieces are very easy to apply.I can't say that decorating my stapler has been a high priority for me, but now that it is done, it's kind of a kick. It would be fun to design a skin for this. Finally, although the Skinit skin is &#8220;free&#8221;, you are in a sense still paying for it, because the stapler itself is overpriced. It&#8217;s easy to go online and select your favorite skin and have it mailed free of charge including shipping to your house. I think it should have at least included a starter skin. I selected a Paris skin that has the Eiffel Tower being viewed from underneath some trees and it looks very pretty. It has a large skin that is applied to the top and two small skins that apply to the bottom sides of the stapler. The skin itself is nice quality and looks very nice and should be durable . Ordering the skin is free (included in cost of stapler) and includes shipping. Creating the skin is a matter of going to their website and choosing a pre-made one, or designing one yourself. Being the Sanrio Hello Kitty lover that I am, I chose a Chococat skin for stapler! It automatically recognized that it was for a free skin to my new Swingline Customizable Fashion Stapler.I typed in my Pin Code. The skin is a wee bit narrow, so there's a bit of white metal left showing at the bottom of each side of the stapler. Or at least I think it is, not totally sure since I couldn't preview anything.Anyway, I selected my skin and it arrived maybe a week or so later. It turned out quite nice.The skin is easy to apply and reapply. This is, presumably, to allow the skin to fit as well as it does.The skin itself is what really makes this stapler different. The skin arrived in about a week. I found it pretty easy to affix the skin to the stapler itself. The skin was relatively simple to put on and the stapler has worked fine. Ordering the free skin that comes with it was simple. The skin is supposed to be mailed to me. Unfortunately I picked a skin based on DaVinci's artwork, so the glossy plastic looking skin winds up looking kind of cheap. The skin has 3 parts, the top and the base of the staple. The skin arrives within a reasonable time.The skin is made of a fairly heavy vinyl. Basically, you are ordering a "skin", a plastic-feeling sticker that will adhere to the stapler.
