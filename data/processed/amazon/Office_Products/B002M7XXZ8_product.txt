Wow, what a great product. These NoteTabs are a very specialized product BUT if you want to annotate a book, mark specific lines, have easy tabbed access to those sections AND you don't want to leave permanent markings - does Avery have a product for you!It's not a replacement for highlighters. I found this to be a good product which does what it claims. Another great product from Avery... However that does not distract too much from this great inovative product. I LOVE this product. Otherwise, they are a superior product. This is a nifty product; a worthy "child of "post-it notes." this product is like a stick it note and tab in one. This is a very cool product. Great product, Avery! I really like this product. This is a great product, and the tabs are substantial & durable. Once again, Avery has produced a well-thought out product that does everything you could want in a temporary divider page note tab.
