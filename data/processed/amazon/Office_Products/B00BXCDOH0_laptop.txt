This Fellowes Laptop Lift can support a 17-inch laptop, but the plastic base flexes and feels flimsy. The laptop is actually kept off of the bottom plate, but there is only a thin amount of air space between the laptop bottom and the holder. These keep the laptop in place, but they extend above my thin laptop, and they are right where my hands will go. It also allows for more airflow around the laptop, since air flows between the lift itself and the laptop, as well as under the lift. It is more effective at keeping our older laptop cool than the black cloth-covered one we were using where the laptop sits directly on the lift. Because your laptop would be up from your desk, the computer then does not heat as much, so that is actually very nice to help your computer live longer. My laptop is starting to run hot so I thought this Laptop Lift would be a good idea for its health - and mine, as I do a lot of work at a table, not a dedicated computer desk, and the height is not ergonomic.The Fellowes I Spire Laptop Lift did indeed help cool my computer, and the angle would be great if I was watching a movie on my computer. )So not for me, but if you're planning to use your laptop mostly for netflix, then this should work for you. I have actually just kept the laptop on the lift sitting on the table. It's easy to move the laptop around from room to room with it open on this. It raises my laptop to a comfortable height on my desk and eliminates neck strain. By lifting the laptop the screen is higher, which will help with one's neck posture. Also, because the laptop is lifted away from the surface, she no longer felt the need to use something to cool the laptop down and having this lift on top of a pillow proved to be surprisingly stable and easy to use.As for desktop usage, it's a little awkward since the keys are lifted to so high up that it may as well be wall-mounted after all is said and done. There is no assembly necessary.My laptop is only 14" so it fits perfectly and securely on it. I'd never use any laptop without some kind of cooling device under it.The angle is kind of odd when you first start using this Laptop Lift, to me it makes me feel like my computer screen is kind of coming at me. I first thought it might be too small/narrow for my laptop, but it actually fits perfectly. My old HP laptop usually gets hot after a short period of usage. It raises my laptop up which allows me  a better view, keeping my neck at a more comfortablle angle . It keeps  my laptop at the right level for me to view the lap top and also type comfortable.

When you are using a laptop at a desk, you can maximize the ergonomic comfort of your neck and wrists by positioning a separate keyboard so that your wrists are either level with the keyboard or slightly higher than the keyboard such that your wrists pivot downward slightly to type.

When the laptop is placed onto this Laptop Lift, the keyboard is pivoted at a 35-degree angle, which makes for uncomfortable ergonomics if you are typing directly onto the laptop's keyboard.

When a laptop is placed flat on a desk or table, that impedes the airflow underneath the laptop where air is drawn into the fan intake openings on these laptops.
