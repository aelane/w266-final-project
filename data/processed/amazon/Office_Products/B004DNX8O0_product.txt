Perhaps the product has been improved since the other reviews were made.The pink marker is darker than the other two. This product satisfies.It takes a little time to get used to the feel of the gel. I suspect that I'll purchase this product again. I  highly recommend this product. I am always looking for a product that can assist me to do my job a little easier.I am happy to report that these highlighters worked great! A great product. Sharpie Accent Gel Highlighters are another great product from Sharpie. This product promotes itself by stating "no smearing". I found this very disappointing.Overall, I think this product is a neat twist on an old idea.

The product will smear and you will transfer the product to other parts of the paper or book on contact.The gel highlighter works similar to a glue-stick....twist the bottom to get more product on top.Pros:- Soft Touch- Won't dry out- No scratching noise while usingCons:- Smears when highlighting pencil marks- Longgg drying times - product will transfer with contact- Lesser luminosity/brightness than a traditional highlighter- More expensive than traditional highlighters- Gel tip shape changes based on your highlighting pattern - no tip consistency

When I read the product description for these highlighters I was excited.

This is the product to use for your Bible or any other thin-paper book.
