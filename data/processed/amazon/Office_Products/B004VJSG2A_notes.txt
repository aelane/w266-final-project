That said, they are flimsy and tear easy, and I find them slightly too narrow to really utilize the `notes' feature that some have noted. I think I was still stumbling around with regular sized sticky notes. I use Post-It notes all the time. There are notes all around my laptop screen. Pretty standard as far as sticky notes go. Even though these are made by Avery, not 3M, they are virtually the same as typical sticky notes. I use sticky notes on my desk all the time. I use small sticky notes for two purposes:  I mark recipes in cookbooks as I plan out my weekly menu, and I mark the pages in craft books - patterns, notes, etc.These sticky notes are perfect for those uses. I don't want to go back to tearing up regular post-it notes. We usually cut up post-it notes for this same purpose and these flags are quite a bit more expensive - so it's up to you whether or not the saved effort is worth the expense. (I think it is, but if I had an intern to cut up post-it notes, I would probably do that instead) They are, however, not too dark for the notes you write on them to be very visible, even if you leave notes in pencil.Overall, this is a great product that I intend to keep using.
