This is a great set. Overall, a great set I would recommend! The set includes a big box of standard staples, as well as a staple remover.If you're in the search for a simple stapler starter kit- no frills, just your basic office item- this is perfect for you. This is a nice, attractive, well-priced set. It is a nice set with the staples included in the package, no need to guess what size to get. It's a nice set for a student desk as it comes with the pincher type staple remover, which works best instead of fingernails, as well as a box of staples. This is a good set so you do not need to buy each piece separate. This is a great set of office stapler products.You get a great  standard Swingline stapler, a box of 5000 staples, and a staple remover.Of course when you think of staplers, you think Swingline, the stapler and stapler products masters.Very recommended! Overall, I really like the set and see it lasting for many years. This is a good set for my home office, a light weight stapler, 5000 staples, and staple remover. The set includes 5000 staples (this will last forever) and a staple remover.

It was nice to have a full set with the staples included.

The set includes a large box of staples - more than I am likely to use in the next 10 years given a mostly paper-less future - and a staple remover which does the job every time I've needed it while retaining it's &#34;Vampire Pac Man&#34; style.Recommended.

I like that the set comes with a box of staples.
