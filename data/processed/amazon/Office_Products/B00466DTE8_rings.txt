However the three rings do close by means of a small prong, that fits into a small indentation, so your papers won't tear as you're turning them. The three rings open and close easily and are gap-free. Being left handed I already fight with the rings on a binder; this location makes the rings even more troublesome when I am trying to right on the paper in the binder. I really like that the three rings do not have the old style zig zag teeth but have one partially hollow end with a prong that guides in the hole creating a clean connection where they meet. I think this will help to keep the rings circular and not askew as can happen with the other style.You can slip a cover inside the clear protective sleeve on the front and on the spine. The rings are sturdy and make it easy for me to flip through the cards and remove/place new cards in. the little rings open and close just as they should. On the rings I have some small size paper where I write notes on whatever project I'm working on, plus I have a plastic zippered container with holes to put on the rings that is filled with a lot more knitting supplies.This works great for my purposes!

The rings are mounted on the right as well.

The rings are a little different in that when they close, one side has a pin that goes into a hole in the other side, so they don't get offset.

It comes with "O" rings, rather than a "D" ring, which is not my ring of choice.
