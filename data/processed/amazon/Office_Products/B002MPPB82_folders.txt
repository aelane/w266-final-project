These are nice accordian-type folders similar to the ones that typically have an elastic band. I use file folders just about every day and always have a few files that are stuffed and need a stronger folder that won't break or fall apart. Overall, I'm very pleased with these folders. I like that it's stacked up with a few folders together and can keep a lot of different papers but same project or overall stack of papers together, and I love the color and the feel of the paper. I've adopted these Smead folders as another tool in my arsenal. Serendipitously there are 4 folders that come in this set and I have 4 family members - I wrote each of our names on one so that each family member can throw their loose papers in there (instead of scattered all around the house). Sizable folders that are tough enough to hold a lot of files on a shelf or in a file cabinet. These folders stand on their own so they work in a hanging file cabinet too, but without the hangers of course (one less thing to break). Just don't overload those folders! They also mix with regular folders in the same drawer very well, and I can stillread all the labels at the top of both types. Nice and sturdy folders which I hope will last a long time. So when I saw these folders I figured I would give them a shot. They are just as good as their previous folders, and they have this addition of an "easy grip" surface near the top that is designed to make the folder easier to grab.It does work, but it takes some getting used to. These handy folders are great. These folders are very basic, but providing good protection and order. These are great little expandable folders. The folders work exactly as before, and this one extra grippy feature made them just a little better. These folders work perfectly for holding a good number of documents and the accordion-like design allows you to expand or contract it to the needed size.

These folders hold a lot of material and are very sturdy.

When they are filled they stand up on their own instead of falling over like so many folders.

I like these folders a lot.
