They just are typical writing pens not unlike a Bic pen with a luittle more glitz. All three pens wrote smoothly as soon as they were opened with clear fine lines. Only one of my pens worked on it. But for me, it's great.The pens themselves work beautifully. Right now, these pens work out to about $3.00 each, which is a reasonable price for the quality. I was intrigued by these hybrid pens; the idea of combining gel and ball-point ink sounded great. The Pilot Acroball pens have some drawbacks, however.The color is bolder and deeper than regular ball-point ink, which I liked. These pens are OK. These pens write so beautifully and feel so great in my hands, I'm always reaching for them to use. Love these pens. Nice writing pens for a good price. The pens are very light and  comfortable to hold, making for an enjoyable writing experience. This is a 3-pack of perfectly fine pens; the grip is comfortable for my smallish hands, the pens look nice enough, and the ink is bright but not smeary. If you lose your pens daily, stick with the true cheapies. Overall, these are good pens at a decent price. The Acroball pens are my new favorite. The pens are a comfortable size with non-slip rubber grips.The gel-like ink flows effortlessly and dries quickly. Great pens. They're nice pens, and very smooth, but they don't quite live up to all their claims.Physically, these pens are lighter and slightly thinner than a Pilot G2 Pro. I really like these pens. I find myself continually trying to grab one of these pens because I like they way they write. These pens write so smoothly and just seem to glide across the paper. These pens come in at least three colors: Black, Blue and Red. I don't like to carry pens with caps in my purse because the caps get loose, lost...and then occasionally the pens leak.

I only recently started to buy gel pens.

I'm happy to say that these pens do indeed write like gel pens without forcing me to wash my hands after every use, and spray my clothes with spot remover before washing them.

I love these pens.
