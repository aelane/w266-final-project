What a fabulous idea!The unit of the tape dispenser has a door that slides open. The Scotch PopUp Tape Handband Dispenser is a good idea but I think it needs to be perfected. I guess it just depends on whether the idea takes off with customers - if so, then the price will probably come down and the refills will always be available.For now, I know this has changed the way that I'll be wrapping presents:). This is such a great idea, it's a wonder it hasn't been in the market a long time before now.The PopUp Tape dispenser is more than easy to use: pop in the pre-cut tape "reloader" block in the case, wrap the stretchy handband around your hand, and go to work.No more juggling while you're wrapping packages, all quite straightforward.Just about the only thing that gave me any problems was trying to figure out how to actually open the case container and which way to place the tape block.Easily, five stars. The SCOTCH POPUP TAPE HANDBAND DISPENSER is a pretty good idea to use to free your hands while wrapping something. Scotch PopUp Tape Handband Dispenser certainly seems like a good idea. That is why the Scotch PopUp Tape Handband Dispenser seems like such a great idea. It is funny how an idea so simple can also be so ingenious! It is such a simply idea, but it makes wrapping SO much easier (and yes I understand giving it to them for Christmas defeats the help on this year's wrapping, but I am thinking about the future! This is a great idea made better. I will be using this quite often, it is a great idea, wish I had thought of it.
