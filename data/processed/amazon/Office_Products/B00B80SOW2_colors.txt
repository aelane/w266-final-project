All the colors really pop! The colors are fun and vibrant shades of melon, bumble gum, sky blue, ocean blue, grape, to name a few. The colors differ in each set with one being more pastels and vibrant and the others more darks and subdued. If you think that the colors look similar, there are several exact matches but one pen has glitter in it. There really are 72 different colors and they really do span the spectrum (and beyond as they provide several colors that combine white with primary colors (so  - pink, for example) and several shades of black to gray. *Some colors are shiny. They are comfortable to write with, and the colors make this a useful set. There are many different colors, some of which are duplicated. I always have a few colors in my handbag because who wouldn't light up at a gorgeous green, beautiful purple and deep brown? The colors are great. The colors are bright, beautiful, and sparkly. The colors are amazing and I enjoyed using different colors to stand out in my journal. The colors pop really nicely.
