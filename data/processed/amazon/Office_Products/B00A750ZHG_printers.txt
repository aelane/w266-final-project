), the Epson WorkForce printers have been solid printing devices. I've used many printers over the years, both inkjet and laser kind. Most Epson printers require you to have all the colors even if you are only printing in black and it charges each color which means you use the colors even if you are printing only in black. Unlike other printers where the wireless set-up let's you "discover" your network wirelessly, the WF-M1030 didn't do it this way.Print Speeds: the WF-M1030 boasts of 34 ppm on draft mode. It is also small and compact as printers go, so it won't take up a lot of space on your deskMy only complaints are minor and won't be an issue for many people. I have set up our other Epson printers on my own very easily - this one is being very, very difficult.One super annoying thing is that the printer comes with no cable to hook it up to the computer for set-up. I've used Epson printers for the past ten years and have generally been verr happy with them. Also, as with most printers, it doesn't come with a USB cord for hooking it up. All our other printers have Airprint so this was a pretty big blow for us.The print quality:  OMG surprisingly really good, and a casual glance could not distinguish it from the laser prints. I have been using monochrome printers for many years now. We have all been through many printers through our lives (probably too many to count), and for 90 bucks you can get a decent inkjet printer with a scanner on it that will last you about a year before it starts giving you problems. I like Epson's printers more than other brands I have tried.CONS:1. Unlike Epson's All-In-One printers, this printer has no copy, fax, or scan functionalities. )Epson printers are all well packed so be sure and search this printer carefully to remove all the Styrofoam and blue packing tape.Using the Quick Start guide, install the single black ink cartridge. Now that I have printers that continue to print even when one cartridge is dry I question the necessity.The ad touts the fact that the printer can print up to 2400 pages on the hi capacity ink cartridge (about 2 cents a copy if my math is right). Ordinarily printers that under $100 are notoriously expensive to use and are suited to one who prints rarely. For so many printers the draft is almost unusable but Epson should be praised for keeping the draft mode usable and ultimately very economical.
