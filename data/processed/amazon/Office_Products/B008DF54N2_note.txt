I think I just like the square note paper with the adhesive edge, but the roll of Post-It's? I admit it; I am a Post-It note freak and I also love to label things. You'll need a full post-it note for anything more than a short note, but that's all I've ever used these for anyways, so I'm thrilled with it. You can write on it like any other Post-it note, too.The older I get, the more I rely on Post-it notes to keep my day on track. It's a sticky note on a roll, it's a versatile label and it's a page marker, all in the same product.I have used the roll anywhere I would use a regular sticky note, it travels much better AND I have used it as page markers in binders and books by folding a portion back under itself. So you aren't trying to stick a note onto something using only a small adhesive surface.Note: this will NOT stick to a cold surface. The entire note is sticky on back so it will adhere better! Sometimes you don't want or need a full-sized Post-It note, and these work perfectly for those moments.

The adhesive is in-between that and a regular Post-It note.

It's sticky all over, so the whole note sticks to paper perfectly & won't fall off or get lost, no matter how many pairs of hands it passes through.So far, my favorite use for this is domestic--it's PERFECT for dating and labeling food and leftovers in the fridge.

If it's impractical to put the note in place before writing the text you'll have to either put the note somewhere else first to write (might lose some adhesive if you do that - put it on a clean, dry surface to keep adhesive loss to a minimum) or write while it's still on the roll.
