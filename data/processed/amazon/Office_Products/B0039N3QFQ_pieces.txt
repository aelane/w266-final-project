It's like having unlimited little pieces stuck on your fingers (well, not unlimited, but more than you need for any one present), and without the accidental sticking together!! Works great for getting those little pieces of tap that you need for just about anything around the office, home office, or whatever really.The dispenser is simple to load, just slide the one side back, pop in the cartridge and you are good to go. It can only dispense pieces of tape of a single length. Believe it or not, 75 pieces of tape can go very quickly. If you frequently need little pieces of tape, it's very handy. However, if you need long pieces (as I usually do) it's not that much help. Second, you get it in small pieces that are just the right length for 95% of your taping requirements. I tried pulling off pieces from the roll of tape in my present weighted dispenser and the size I naturally tear off is very close to the size of these pieces which are 2" long. There are 75 pieces of tape in each refill packet and that seems adequate, but there is no way to see how much tape is remaining in the dispenser so you could run out when it is least convenient. The pre-cut pieces are slightly larger than what I would normally tear off, but being able to grab a piece of tape with one hand has been more useful than I would have expected. The little pieces of tape stick straight up out of the top and you just pull one out while the next one lines right up and sticks out of the slot, ready for your next use. Depending on how much you use, 75 pieces probably won't last very long.Bottom line: I am going to stick with the "old fashioned" tape dispensers. I also find the pieces of tape it dispenses are bigger than what I'd usually use, and I feel guilty for wasting tape. The pre-cut pieces are the perfect size for wrapping presents.The dispenser is nice, because you simply open it up, drop the tape refill in, close it up, and it's ready to use.The color I received was a lime green shade. Would be nice if it came with more than 75 pieces of tape. The pre-cut pieces of Scotch tape in concert with this dispenser is the result of cross-breeding a conventional tape dispenser and a Post-it Note dispenser concept. Is it so hard to pre-cut 4 pieces of tape, stick one end to the table, and use them one-by-one while wrapping the gift?But, I am glad I ordered this product.

Alternately, you can't have longer pieces should you need them; however each strip is about 2 inches which covered all the tasks I typically use tape for.

The pieces are stacked onto a small pad that is easy to put into the dispenser.

You get 75 pieces of tape that are 2" long.
