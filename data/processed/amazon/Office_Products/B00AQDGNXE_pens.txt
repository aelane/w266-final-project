Give them these pens, and if they never return it...as they seem to do, it's ok.So, all in all..... does not write smooth, makes noise on the page as one writes, outside of pen looks and feels cheap. I got all excited about G2 pens in pretty colors, including silver, but I thought that was the actual ink color. No such luck - they're still just black pens. Most pens with a 0.7 mm would be considered medium. I received these pens via the Amazon Vine Review Program. Some might consider these pens expensive, but not after you've written with one. These pens are fine point so I would use them less often than medium pointed pens. The pens write well all the time and are my go-to pen. I look for them when buying pens. I prefer pens without the clip because I think they balance in your hand better.There is a black rubbery part on the lower part of the pen that helps some with pen comfort. But I have held more comfortable pens. The pens I received were pretty but leaky. Looking for new pens all the time to ease strain on the hand. Second, these pens are refillable usingPilot G2 Gel Ink Refill, 2-Pack for Rolling Ball Pens, Fine Point, Black Ink (77240), so you can keep using these until (hopefully not--that would be a shame!) This is one of the few pens I'll use with myMoleskine Evernote Smart Notebook Ruled Large (Moleskine Classic)because it's the only one I can always count on to give me a strong, dark line.The pen doesn't skip or bleed. Though both are 0.7mm gel pens, I think that the writing of the 207 is just a bit crisper than that of the G-2. I was disappointed with these pens. It seems so little, but it was enough to turn me away from these pens. I have been using these pens for all sorts of things: grocery lists, writing checks, making notes, etc. These pens are great! These pens are also supposed to offer smooth writing and that's where they least impressed me. I tossed these pens in the garbage. I love these pens and everyone in my family picked one color that they liked. The best pens write dark and clearly. But most importantly, these are great pens. These pens are great. I am obsessed with nice pens -- just can't get enough of them. I like using colored pens when taking notes, but I usually don't use gel pens because they have a tendency to bleed through the pages. These pens are perfectly sized for my small hands, but they fit as well in my husband's stocky hands. Even though the pens say that they write at a 0.7mm width, the line is fine and clean, looking closer to a 0.5 mm for me, so that's an added plus. Pilot G2 pens are my favorite pen to write with. I was very pleased when I got these pens in the mail.While I would have liked colored ink to match the barrel decoration, I was content with black in all of the pens as it's my preferred ink color.The pens are very nice with a comfy foam grip and metallic scrollwork (with a nice flower design) running along each pen barrel in a different color.The ink is smooth and because it's a gel pen they don't require a lot of pressure when writing. I discovered these pens in 2003 and refuse to buy any other. I don't really get these pens. ThesePilot G2 Retractable Premium Gel Ink Roller Ball Pens, Fine Point, Black Ink, Dozen Box (31020)are the same pens without the embellishment and cost about 40% less. I LOVE pens. I've found the Pilot G2 pens to be some of the easiest pens to write with. They're absolutely gorgeous pens and look so good that I have had to hide them from my daughter! These pens are consistently good, with no leaking or skipping. These pens have a sort of Victorian steampunk vibe. The pens work good too. I found these pens to fit comfortably in my hand, are stylish, write smoothly, and have a solid feel to them.I
