This file is not only TUFF ("Tyvek reinforced", "holds 900+ sheets", has "Thicker front and back panels"), it is HEAVY -- So NICE!! This expanding file is well-constructed and will hold a large number of papers. This is a useful file for items that need to be organized by date and it's large enough to handle significant contents.If you are looking for some organization in a home office, this might work for you. Unfortunately, this is not a traveling file and it has no closure, which makes it's usefulness limited. This could be used well as a file kept permanently in a cabinet, but it can't be carted around on its own and it needs to be placed somewhere sturdy since it cannot be closed. If you want to drop this file and have it still standing you can. If you are looking for a file that will allow you to sort receipts or other small papers by month, then this folder would serve your purposes. So, if you are not able to sit this file in a place where it will not tip over, I would look for another file. When that happens it will spread, and eventually the file will look pretty bad.I also think that the file should have been made just a touch wider. While you can get a file folder to slide into it, it is not at all convenient to do so, and it has to squeeze into the wider part of the section, where the accordion side is at its widest. If you want to put a few file folders in it, you'll be out of luck. This expanding file does the job. I quit using conventional file folders a long time ago. If you need expanding file folders, especially ones with 12 pockets, you can't go wrong with these. I really do like this expanding file! So, anyway, it's a decent enough file holder, but the lack of a top flap was a lot more problematic than I'd originally foreseen, so I don't think I'll be using this much. If you need an open file for your office that you don't plan to travel with it, this is for you.Con:My biggest complaint about the product is that it's just the slightest bit too narrow to put file folders in. After reading David Allen's "Getting Things Done" I actually followed through and got this file folder.It works well as a tickler or next month to do file. The Smead Tuff file organizer is just like the rest of the Smead products. The Smead expanding file is perfect for individual or business use, and is sure to keep all your paperwork organized and neat! This is a file that has the 12 pockets labeled with the months on it.Pros:- Sturdy. The Smead Tuff expanding file is a sturdy product.
