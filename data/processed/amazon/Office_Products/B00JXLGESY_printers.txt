I have recently installed three new printers and this one falls in the same category of time and ease as all the others. Software comes with the printers and I installed mine on my MAC, by way of a download.The print speed is very good and in my case the printer was not that noisy. Set up was about the same as for most printers, straight forward and rather simple, grabbed onto the wireless network with not a hitch. I've got several Epson printers, both at home (Artisan 837, Epson C810) and at the office (Workforce 3520). Both of these fantastic printers have exceptionally generous sized ink cartridges which initially cost a little more but deliver value by lowering the ink cost per page as well as saving the time land aggravation of constant refills (these XL cartridges look to have about 2.5(X) the ink of an average home inkjet model.I really like this printer. I really like to have my printers multi-task and this one does almost everything. We've had Epson printers in the past and found them to be long-lasting and reliable. All the printers use the PrecisionCore print chip packs with 600 nozzles per inch producing drop sizes of 1.5 to 24 picoliters. This is not one of my favorite printers. I have had a great many Epson WorkForce printers. They are good reliable printers that just plain Work!
