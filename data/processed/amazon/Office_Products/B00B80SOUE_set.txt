This pen set is very good for kids who like to color or people who need to color code lists; etc. Perfect set for the whole family, including three plain black pens for dad. The Sakura Jellyroll was a set of 10 metallic pens and all were tested.Smudge:This happens if the ink dries too slowly or especially where a pen is defective and leaves little droplets along the line. This set of pens is way more than complete. This set would be a fabulous gift for anyone who enjoys art, or creative ways of keeping notes. This is such a great set of pens. I am in LOVE with this set of TEKwriter Gelwriter pens! This set includes lots of colors. This set is a good choice, since it closes and has a handle, if you want to tote the pens around, though.The pens don't come in chromatic order. This set would be so much fun for kids! The set includes 100 pens in a variety of colors and tip sizes, including pastel, neon, metallic, and glitter pens.
