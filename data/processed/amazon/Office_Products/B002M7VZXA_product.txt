The product warns that some inks my stick to the reposition-able adhesive, but I've used these on many types of printed pages, both old and new, without incident. Now that I know Avery makes a nearly identical product, I will buy the cheapest of the two going forward. This product is great for the teacher, student, or anyone who wants to make notes without damaging a book. I highly recommend this product! I recommend this product easily. This product is free of those two faults. When I wrote on the product with pen the ink and tested it immediately, the ink did not smear. This product combines the two.It's a great idea. This product works great.The plastic is more substantial than a flag -- another thing to consider. I love this product - it is a sturdy, self-adhesive tab that you can add to a regular sheet of paper to create an instant notebook divider. Terrific product. I would definitely continue using this product on my organizer divider folders and my planner. Yay Avery for creating a useful product! Sometimes you just need a basic product that does the job well.
