They adhere the best to paper, but aren't as sticky on walls, monitors, desks, etc, as the other ones. I don't feel so bad using these since they're made from recycled paper and with a plant-based adhesive that is replenished after harvesting. I am so thankful that all of them were invented.I especially like these Post-Its as they are made from recycled paper and the plant-based adhesive works great. The sticky back stays on strong, yet peels off without marring the paper surface. They stick to paper just as efficiently, so not a big deal, but for other purposes, it could be a plus or a minus. The paper is not as thick and glossy as the original notes but they are still of very high quality. The paper the notes are made from is recycled material. Usually recycled paper products skimp a tad on quality and the paper leaves a little to be desired. The paper is high quality with bright colors and a smooth writing surface. Knowing they are from recycled paper makes them even more appealing to use. The paper seems a little bit thinner but that makes no difference when writing notes; the advantage is that these are recycled and thus better for the environment. The only negative is that the paper is slightly rough since they are made of recycled paper.
