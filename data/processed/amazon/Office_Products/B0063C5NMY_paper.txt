For those of us who still need paper notes to remind us and others of things they are a great thing and would compliment many a desk or cubicle. The paper on the lime pad is a medium green, more like an avocado than the picture here on Amazon. The paper on the orange pad is a darker/more intense canary color. The paper on the strawberry one is like a light peppermint color. Call me old fashioned, but I do like paper and post-its. The last paper cube I had was from a bank so this was a beautiful change with luscious fruits keeping me company on my desk. The paper has no scent, despite the fruit designs. The paper itself is a color that matches the artwork on the edges. I cannot tell if it is the paper itself or perhaps the glue is scented.Still, the pads are nice and of reasonable quality. They are sticky, they are note paper, what is not to like? Many now have colored paper which is great for breaking away from the standard yellow stickies,  but the fruity graphic (literal, not pejorative) on the side really livens things up.Hope it doesn't seem petty but the description is NOT accurate - these are only 2-3/4" square.
