I hope these come out in more colors soon. The colors do not bleed through! I suppose the colors could be a bit brighter and the cap a tad easier to remove, but I consider this highlighter a vast improvement over the felt markers. All three colors worked like a charm, highlighting without smudging the data.Now, I do have a couple of caveats. They do just what they should do and the different colors are nice to have. The colors are vibrant and the markers are sturdy and easy to grip. The colors work well, and I haven't had any problems with bleed-through. Also, the colors themselves are rather pale, even though they are fluorescent.The writing "point" on the highlighters is a broad, half-inch-wide, rounded-off stub that more or less "conforms to your handwriting style", as advertised. The colors are bold and apart from the material the tips are made of, they have all the functionality one would hope for from highlighters.My only complaint is that because the tips are wide, the ability to do precision-marking is reduced. I love the bright colors, yellow, pink and orange, all more neon than anything. As for the colors, they really pop out, vivid. I have to be honest, I used all the colors, more than once and they all smeared.
