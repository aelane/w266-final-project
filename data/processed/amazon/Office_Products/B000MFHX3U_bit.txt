It works every bit as well because I think that the white portion of this eraser is actually made of the same stuff. I just couldn't resist - - I had to try a bit of permanent marker in a corner just to see if the eraser would remove it with just water. Yes, it did.Now, this may seem a bit trivial, but I like the way they feel in my hand. With just a bit of effort, I could remove most of them without water, and by using a bit of water, I was able to remove the rest.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the blue sponge part wasn't particularly comfortable to grip. This eraserr easily and quickly removed every bit of market that was on the whiteboard and even removed older stains that were on it from who knows what. You can also apply a bit spray of water or dry erase spray which makes it even better.This is practically just a foam eraser. I sprayed a bit of water onto the eraser (didn't soak it) and with a little pressure, the boards are now CLEAN! Dry, the 3M Whiteboard Eraser works well at removing fresh and even not-so-fresh drawing - I found that a bit of pressure and the mild abrasive sponge worked well, but years-old residue was resistant. But since they are a bit fragile I'd recommend using a regular eraser most of the time and have these around for periodic maintenance or accidents. These remind me a bit of Magic Erasers but they hold their shape better.

Just use a bit of water and it turns your old whiteboard from a ghosted mess to something that actually resembles a white board.

I found that just a tiny bit of water and a very light touch worked best to avoid smears.

It took a bit of elbow grease, but EVERY MARK came off of the board.
