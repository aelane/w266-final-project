Second, you can rip these off to the exact length you need and as it's longer than it is wide, you can write lengthy messages in giant bold letters so nobody (I'm looking at my co-parent) can declare that they didn't see the note.I've used them for numbers to remember, taking messages, writing down doctor's appointments while on the phone that do eventually go in my iPod touch's calendar, but then I can stick the note as a reminder where I'll see it and won't forget it even after I mute reminders a bunch of times. You can pull out as much or as little as you need, for the correct length every time. I prefer these because it's simply to get the length I need and plus, it's easily removable without leaving a sticky residue behind. Because I determine the length of the label, I am not limited to just an few inches. The 3M Post-it Full Adhesive Roll 1 x 400 Inches (Green) works just as advertized - you can select the length of strip you need and place it wherever you'd place regular Post-Its. It can be a full length tab on a page.The florescent green color sticks out, attracting attention to whatever your stick it to.I use it to put removable labels on folder tabs.Disadvantage: It takes two hands to put a quick "sticky" on a document.Regular post it's are slightly easier to manage (one handed pull and stick). However, I'm not so sure I like the length they have created. It is easy to roll out the needed length of sticky for each use. The length supplied is reasonable provided the price is not too high.

"Perfect length every time"?

With the Post-it Full Adhesive Roll, you choose the length to fit your need.

I can choose the length.
