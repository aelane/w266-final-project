Next, the dispenser is easy to reload. This is a very classy looking dispenser that looks more like a lovely paperweight. Fun and very handy dispenser! It is heavy enough that the dispenser doesn't move when you grab the post-its and it is easy to refill. The dispenser has nice clean lines and looks professional. The dispenser is well-made, rugged, easy to fill and it's sturdy enough to make it easy to grab a Post-It without the dispenser moving around on your desk. This dispenser stays put, so you can just grab a Post-It without that second hand to hold the dispenser itself.Definitely recommended! So this pop-up dispenser seemed like a great solution. Post-it Pop-up Notes Dispenser is nice looking dispenser for Post-it notes that out-of-the box includes 50-sheet pad of notes.Although looking cool this dispenser isn't completely functional because the notes papers aren't so easy to be taken out from it.Also, its cover doesn't completely fit resulting in slight move each time new note is pulled out.Although this dispenser would be nice add-on on your desk I suggest you should try to first before purchase to avoid being disappointed. This is a great dispenser that goes well together with the Post-It notes which I often use. This dispenser work very well. This dispenser won't budge. Finally, a dispenser that is perfect in many ways. This is a very good dispenser. The dispenser comes pre-loaded with a pad of notes but when it's time for a refill,  bear in mind that it requires the Pop-Up Post-it Notes in order to work properly.I really appreciate the paperweight function too. The dispenser weighs in at 1 lb., 3.2 oz. This is a wonderful dispenser for post-it notes. There's just not much to this dispenser. This pop up dispenser has a nice heft to it to keep it from sliding around on your desk and has a rubber grip on the bottom. This dispenser keeps them close at hand and because of its weight (it's much heavier than it looks - it feels like a paper weight), it's easy to tear off a note with just one hand (a helpful feature when using them to jot down a phone message). It's a Post-It Note dispenser AND a paperweight. The dispenser is sort of abstractly artsy, too, so it doesn't look like an eyesore sitting on your desk. the dispenser has a respectable heft to it, so it can easily be used as a paperweight as well.
