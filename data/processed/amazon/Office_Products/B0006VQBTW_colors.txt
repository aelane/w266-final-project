Each of the bright colors has a small eraser on it's cap that allows for convenient and precise erasing. The colors (excepting the yellow) are all bright and easy to read, and the magnets are useful for sticking the marker to the refrigerator side. I also bought the bright colors pack and was perfectly happy with them. That keeps them from drying out and always at hand.Having the multiple colors available without searching for a different marker is a fine thing. We use different colors to list &#34;things to do for the next day&#34;, for kids' chores, for bills due later, for household repairs needed but not instantly such as painting, and for miscellaneous. These colors are nice to have, and they erase easily. I love the colors and the concept, but here are a few observations:+ No odor when uncapped, as compared to other Dry-Erase markers+ Magnet holds to refrigerator fine+ Pretty colors, but the yellow is very light. I really like the colors on these markers, they are easy to write with, and the writing is quite readable. Was happy to get these and I like the colors. The colors are vibrant and the writing is smooth and sharp with all the markers except the orange one which has never worked well. the colors are so light that they are hard to read what is written on my white board. The colors are bright enough to be fun but deep enough to be visible across the room. The colors are fun though and it might be nice for little hands in a long car ride (no big odor). The different colors make it easy to show complex processes with color-coding. The colors of these are bright -- contrary to some other reviews -- and even the yellow is visible on my white board. The colors are vibrant and easily visible from a distance. I was so excited to see these cute colors on sale. Like the colors; love the eraser-caps. The colors on these markers were bright against a whiteboard, which is good because I have difficulty seeing things written on a white board from a distance. The colors are bright, the ink is readable, and it's fun to color-code your whiteboard.Here's the important question: how serious is your white board? The colors are sufficiently differentiated. They write/draw smoothly and consistently and the colors are bright and vibrant. Their colors are vivid, and the fine point allows you to write in a finer print than many dry erase markers. I liked the different colors because I used each one to show the different points I was giving. I found the colors to be vivid and show up nicely. I tried all the colors. Still, the colors are nice, and the quality is not lacking. I knew they would like these based on the colors - and I was right!

I didn't need all the colors for my reunion board, but on the way in the car, the kids had a blast with them.

I was excited to get these because I like bright colors, and because I keep a family whiteboard calendar that I like to color code (don't judge, I'm fussy).

The other colors are pale.
