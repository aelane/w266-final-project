This shredder cuts horizontally and vertically, so you output is confetti not paper strips (this is the cross-cut feature). While shopping for a new shredder I evaluated console mode shredders (rather than waste basket style like this one) and they were easier to empty because because you don't need to remove the shredding mechanism, however they were more expensive. Our last Fellowes shredder just stopped working after giving us wonderful service for a number of years.This new replacement promises to give us the same quality of service.Our older one had a light when the shredder was on...it would be a good feature to incorporate in all models.The cross shredding process gives us peace of mind and security. Much less an unreliable one such as this Powershred shredder being sold here on amazon? Bought this shredder to replace a GBC shredder that lasted over 10 years! The GBC shredder was indestructible. The Fellows shredder is a bit noisy, but not too bad considering it cuts the paper into confetti. Bought this shredder for the security of cross-cut. My previous Fellowes shredder finally gave up the ghost after several years of reliable service. I purchased this shredder as a more or less equivalent unit--comparing the two:Pros:- This shredder has a lot more umph. The old shredder could barely eat through three pages at a time.- Nice handle helps to lift the business end of the shredder off of the bucket.- The cord doesn't tend to get twisted in knots (unlike its predecessor).Cons:- This shredder is LOUD!!!! I think I should wear ear protection.- The shredder head has an awkward fit on the bucket. Once I got another working shredder, I finished up my shredding with no problems whatsoever. I would definitely try to buy a Fellowes shredder, if I could find what I wanted, because they treat their customers well. It will keep the shredder from jamming up and runs more smoothly when you also get the oil for it. I tried a less expensive shredder and I broke it within a day or two. Below I have broken the shredder review down into three crucial parts, Performance / Design / Durability** PERFORMANCE **The Fellowes Powershred W-11C is a monster. The shredder began to slow when 7+ sheets were fed into it at once so I recommend no more than 6 sheets to avoid unnecessary motor stress.When it came to inserting documents to shred, the 9" opening was perfect and the machine cared little for how the document was fed through it. However, if you only use your shredder casually the use of Vegetable oil can be a problem since it could go rancid and begin to gunk up the gears. Just shred, run the shredder for 15 seconds in reverse and you are done. I highly recommend this shredder. This is the second shredder I have owned, and I am impressed! This shredder eats several pages with ease. We got this shredder a few months ago for home use. The shredder bin is the size of a large personal office wastebasket, and is easy to empty: the shredder just sets on top of it. Former shredder was good, but lacked good manual input and did not perform like stated. The shredder is heavy but it has a handle that makes it easy to pick up. I had a Fellowes shredder but it would struggle, very noisily, if I put more than three sheets in at the same time. Daughter says she's loving this shredder and the cross cutting it does..  Nice sized waste bin, easy to lift off with built in handle and it will handle up to 11 sheets. When moving, we had to leave behind a shredder just like this. *UPDATE - 9/17/10:: We've been using this shredder since June & it doesn't seem so quiet anymore. We are still very satisfied with this shredder. We discovered that the shredder had  plastic & metal cutting blades. So we made sure to buy a shredder with all metal blades. I have had this shredder for six months and it still works great! I was debating between this one and the AmazonBasics shredder and I'm glad I went with this one. This shredder is LOUD but that's because good shredders often are. Good shredder, plows through unopened junk mail even when it sounds like it's having trouble (it will slow down but not give up). So it's a 5-star shredder to us.It has one other great attribute: for some reason, it doesn't scare our cat when we shred something (the same cat that eats through the roof when the vacuum cleaner gets turned on), so when he sleeps on his pad near us in our home office, we can shred away and not bug him. That's amazing, because this is NOT a quiet shredder. My old shredder had a pull out bin that inevitably left a mess of shredded paper on the floor. This Fellowes W-11C shredder is an excellent automatically-engaged shredder capable of shredding 11 double-sided color magazine pages into 1 inch to 1 and 1/2 inch in length by 3/16 inch wide cross-cut confetti strips. The best personal shredder I have owned. Automatically turns off when the shredder is lifted off the basket. This shredder is very good. I've had this shredder for about six months in my home office. Nice shredder with one problem. The shredder doesn't work unless it sits perfectly on its original basket which has a piece of plastic that hits a switch making the whole thing. I have been using this shredder for three years and it's still shredding. Although this is a very good shredder for the money, I will probably look for a more heavy duty model for my small business. This shredder is pretty good for the price but, if you are willing to spend more, you can completely alleviate any and all of the negatives with this shredder which are:-It's quite loud which is annoying in an office environment or even in a home.-It bogs down and can jam if you feed it more than about 7 pages and it can be a hassle to have to worry about counting out less pages to feed it.-The top part (motor) is quite heavy, making it a pain to have to lift in order to empty the bin, which you will have to do very often. If you need a silent shredder, this is not it. Tough and easy to use shredder.T
