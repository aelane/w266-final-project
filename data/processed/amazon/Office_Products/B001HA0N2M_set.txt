I also have a set of their neon colored ones!The best thing? That hasn't happened with this set at all. I would definitely recommend these as a great set of dry-erase markers. I could be wrong, though, as one of the set that I've been using has apparently started leaking. This set of marker is a 4-pack (colors: black, red, royal blue, and a greenish/blue) NOT a 5-pack as the description states.These markers are close to the same size as a traditional pen so they feel more comfortable when writing. They are also very long lasting - I have a second set of these that I've had for 6 months and they are still going strong, with only about half of the ink gone. This is a set of dry-erase markers that write clearly with good control, stay on the marker board till you're ready to remove them, and then wipe off easily. Perhaps it will help you remember that this is the set that really does its job. I really like this set of dry erase markers in assorted colors. I really like this set. I think this is a really nice set of dry-erase markers and I would highly recommend them. This set works great and no strong smell.
