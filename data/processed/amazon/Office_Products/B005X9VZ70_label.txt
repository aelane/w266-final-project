The other label maker, an Epson LabelWorks LW-400, was very impressive, but was $10 more at the time I received the Dymo.First, the Dymo uses six AAA batteries. Maybe I was spoiled by the other label maker, but the Dymo is somewhat unpleasant to use. Once inserted, then open up the label maker cartridge labeled 'D1' Label Cassette, and put it into the compartment that sits at the top of the unit on the back. To cut the label stream, there is a button on the right side of the label maker. It's quick to simply type in the label you want and then print it off. This label maker is very portable, but the Pnp is quicker and easier for me to use. So, I held the label maker level and pulled out the tape a little more. This label maker is best for individual labels. If you're looking for an affordable, basic label maker, this will serve your needs. The label maker does not print. The label feed does work but nothing is printed. So, since I can easily cut the unprinted label that is ejected, I guess this earns one star. Comparing this Label Manager to a Dymo Letratag label maker that I purchased a couple years ago, I personally like the smaller LetraTag. I've had a Brother P-touch label maker for several years now. The label prints out beautifully on a shiny strip of white shiny plastic paper. I really like how easy this label maker is to use. The label cutter makes producing professional looking labels a snap. Since I don't use my label maker regularly, I find that I often need to replace the dead batteries before I can use it. Having a label maker with an A/C adapter would be ideal for me. I've been thinking of replacing my old Dymo label maker (which is more than 10 years old, still sort of works). The label rolls aren't cheap. (I could even print a label for those buttons).Printed labels typically cost 10-20 a piece for short names, phone numbers, etc. This is my first label maker that I've actually owned, but I've used other ones in the past. Even though label rolls run expensive, I don't see myself using this device often enough to blast through the roll that quickly. I have a Brother label maker which was such a pain to figure out the keyboard switching commands; not this one. Just basic label making. A tiny label in tiny font wastes 1/2 inch of space on either side of the label. I've used several label makers over the years. I have been a Brother label maker user for years. I actually made my first label without reading the "manual". I have used a label maker for many years. For the past 4-5, my primary label device has been the Brother PT-2430PC. This label maker is so busy in my house, marking kitchen containers, office folders, light switches, and the like. Could not get a label printed. 's available for 1/4" label)., 16pt., 20pt. 's compatible with 1/2" label width)2. I've used several different label makers, and this Dymo ones stacks up well with the rest. I definitely recommend this label maker. I have been using Dymo label makers for over 30 years, going back to the embossed labels you cranked-out one letter at a time in the late 70's and early 80's. Unfortunately, when I use a label maker I expect the labels to stay attached for years, not weeks, or months, or even days, when used to label wires. When I received this label maker, I solicited the opinion of a friend who is a top-notch professional organizer. This DYMO label maker is super sweet. Looking for a good portable label maker, easy to carry, small enough for a backpack or book bag... this is the one for you. This label maker was easy to set up - just add 6 AAA batteries and insert the included label roll (1/2" wide and 10' long). I've owned several of these and to print a basic label there was no SETUP involved...) This unit would be 4 star. All very simple, however, though the label advanced, nothing printed on it. This little label maker is surprisingly fun and easy to use and produces a very professional looking label quickly. This is the first electronic label maker I have used; compared to the old press a letter label makersI have bought in the past this is awesome. Finally a label maker which has a large enough screen to see your labels easily. Test how other label makers feel and function, and I believe you will find this label maker superior to others. I remember when a Dymo label maker was the dial-and-click type, that left a raised character on thick plastic tape. Now, Dymo makes label makers that are modern and efficient, with some nice extra features.The 160 Hand Held is a decent size for portable use, although it is just barely hand-held size. The label tape is thin and easy to work with, and can be easily trimmed for a nice custom fit. The label tape comes in replaceable cartridges, similar to P-Touch and others. I have a label maker already - but it's enormous. This is a good, basic, few-frills label printer.Pros:-Easy/intuitive to use.-Can print 6 different font sizes, italic, bold, underline & vertical text.-Symbols & clip art; the basics & then some.-Qwerty Keyboard (computer keyboard letter/number layout)- The label backing is split down the middle so it comes off in 2 pieces which makes removing the backing easy.-Good LCD display.-Fits in my not-so-big hand; not too heavy which makes it portable.-Has last-label memory so you can do multiple labels without having to retype.Cons:-Keyboard is tight/small so it's easy to accidentally hit the wrong key.-Uses 6 AAA batteries or you can buy the optional electric cord.-Instructions are very basic 1-sheet photo instructions. If you're looking for a handy label maker for light home or office use, this is highly recommended. The first label I printed got stuck. The second label was fine, and I cut off the bad part from the first try. This label maker will get the job done, but I find it to be too complicated to use. In a label maker, I don't need a zillion different fonts, boxes, borders, icons, etc. Doing the easy label is difficult.This might be good for someone that has a need to get Really Creative ,but if you are looking for a product to just label items easily, it isn't for you! I tried to print the label, and it was jammed. I tried to print again, and it printed a nice label. I understand that the label cassettes are expensive. If I were a professional label maker I would not use this machine. The label maker just would not print. I tried readjusting the label cartridge. That worked and the little label maker finally printed!After I got it working, I liked it. My other label maker has the date function so I don't need to type in the date, but it comes out in the 05/01/2012 format.The display is nice and easy to read. ?Overall, a decent label maker once you get it to work. I've tested many label makers in the past. Most label makers I use and test fall into this category, but it's fair to say if you're used to a larger label maker, you might be challenged here. You type in what you want the label to say, you hit the PRINT button, and out scrolls your label. You can have a label that the whole label is bold, underline, and italic. You can't make a label where the second word only is bold and underline.-you have to do things its way-hit menu to go into the menu, but have to hit back to leave (menu again doesn't leave). But I feel that that's true for all label makers. I loved this label maker and it served me faithfully until last year when it stopped printing correctly (producing very light type, even with new tape). I have a DYMO LetraTag label maker that I really like and that I find perfectly acceptable even for some business purposes, and thus it is my comparison point.This label maker, with its QWERTY keyboard, and ~14 additional buttons, is much, much more convenient. It's portable and the label cartrdiges are economically priced. I have 2 dymo label machines. I have used a few different label makers -- this one is on the nicer side.The keyboard is nicely laid out. I checked the label cassette and found the ribbon had slack and was pulled away from the label tape. It spits out with my printed label. It's just not getting fused to the label. Finally I am able to print my first label. After printing a label, it seems you have to go delete it character by character or it stays as the active label, even after you turn the machine off and back on again. making the label maker on slight high end. The label maker itself is great nice keyboard and design is great. I found this label maker easy to use without reading the instructions and I'm terrible with anything involving buttons, I don't even own a cell phone, really. This label maker is quite versatile and does a nice job of making easy to read labels. I got this label maker to use at my office. This label maker lives up to it's description with a nice easy qwerty keyboard, clip art and symbol options.Pros:QWERTY keyboard with big enough keys my husband can use it with his larger fingersLots of clip art and symbol optionsEasy to find consumablesEasy to read LCD displayIntuitive to useCutter cuts cleanlyVery professional looking labelsSmudge and water resistant labels- I put one label on my coffee cup, and it hasn't faded with hand washingCons:Size- definitely not designed for smaller hands, I could only use this for a limited amount of timeBatteries- it takes a lot of batteries, if you're going to be leaving this in a drawer for long periods of time, I recommend just putting in batteries when you use them, then taking them out to use in other things. I bought my first DYMO label maker 40 years ago in 1972. As for the label makers themselves, Epson and DYMO are tied as being the best, and Brother is behind them. The label maker itself is very sturdy with an easy to view screen and has a comfortable computer style Qwerty keyboard. This label maker 160 comes with a white with black type label cassette that is 1/2 inch wide by 10 feet. The label itself is shiny polyester coated, scratch and chemical resistant and truly almost indestructible. These D1 label cassettes are more expensive in the stores, than here on Amazon. I'm not sure there really are any simple label makers anymore.I
