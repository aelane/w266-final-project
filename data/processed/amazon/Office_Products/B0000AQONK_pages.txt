The pages are nice, lined and numbered and can be used for a number of things.I would definitely recommend this product. The pages are also perforated so once you complete your tasks you can tear it out and start a new page. The pages are perforated for easy removal. The pages are on a moderately heavy (20-lb) paper stock and are easily detachable from the binder, but can also be left in the notebook as a work log, or whatever. perforated so pages can be removed easily without jagged edges or messy book. The pages are perforated for quick and clean removal.I'm using this to plan and track my students' individual progress, to implement an action plan to expand my business, to plan my spring and summer gardening, and to plan and track some home renovations. The pages are clean and uncluttered by lettering that someone else thinks you need. There are different pages for professional goals and personal goals. However, should you not wish to remove the pages, they stay firmly in place in the notebook, which is spiral-bound. The pages are a slightly larger than many other planners, (8 1/2&#34; x 11&#34;), and the paper itself is slightly thicker (20 lb, of which 30% is post consumer waste) than many other planners. The pages themselves are printed in eye-easy colors, and the covers are sturdy yet quite flexible.It's a good product, but I find it a bit pricey.
