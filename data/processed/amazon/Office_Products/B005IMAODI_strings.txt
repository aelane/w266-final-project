I was very pleased to see that the strings were long enough - in fact, they are 4 inches long, not including the little latching pieces. The strings themselves are pretty standard with little flare, but lock making them perfect for price tags. Instead of strings, these tags include professional permanently-closing ties, which were a double-edge sword. The plastic strings and labels seem to be holding up well but I haven't been in a wet situation to date. The white strings are included in the box so you just pop out the pre-punched hole on each tag and hang according to desired length, or if you want a fancier tie, just substitute with your own choice of string, wire or ribbon. The strings come with, but they are not yet attached as you have to print your tags first without them. The strings have a small plastic lock on them so they can be easily attached. They can either be attached with the sturdy strings that are included or taped to the box, package or parcel that needs to be labeled. They include the plastic strings and punch out easily. They're easy to print on, tear apart and use with the strings. They come with "strings" (unique zip ties) and you can download so many different designs from Avery.I am especially looking forward to using these 100% customizable tags for holiday gifts come this December. The strings make it easy to attach to all sorts of items. the tie strings work really well, very durable and easy to use. Though the strings that come with the set are fine as is, crochet cotton works nicely using a rug-loop type attachment to the card (and looped similarly around the item it's attached to), creating a softer look that, with this type of "knot," also helps the tag sit flat. The strings that come with the set, conversely, lock together for projects that need to be more permanent (like price tags).Avery's website has a free template available for download, but they also provide some free pre-designed tags on their site, as well. The strings, with a latching system make the connection secure, but of a fixed length. The strings are a lot nicer than expected.
