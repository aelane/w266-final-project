It's easy to change the ink cartridges. I don't like not having separate ink cartridges for each color because it makes for additional waste, and it seems these ink cartridges cannot be refilled at any of the big office stores which is another environmentally unfriendly element. The ink cartridge has a poor life I only print 100 sheets and the ink will be over soon, and if you finish one cartridge the color or the black you can print, you need to have the two, in my old printer you can only print with black or color you don't need two and the life of the ink cartridges is better so I will go back to my old printerEpson WorkForce WF-3540 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer, Copier, Scanner, 2-Sided Duplex, ADF, Fax. I guess they rethought that, as the ink for this printer costs $40! Install ink cartridges. Lift ink cartridge lever back in place with finger tip. Also, the ink that it takes is true to Canon form and is very affordable.The only problem that we have run into so far is that when trying to get it set up to wirelessly print, it will only accept letters in the password. Using black ink for most uses is best to prolong ink use. It runs out of ink quickly, too. Don't give up.The ink cartridges are readily available, it performs well with different types of paper, and it's quite sturdy. The ink lasts as long as most inject printers.Overall, Im happy with a printer that is easy to setup and simply works.
