What can you say about a paper clip really. Does it hold the paper yes, in my case my only issue is they leave a blackish dirt color on white paper as they where not washed before packing. I highly recommend just buying these paper clips at your local Dollar General store. Otherwise these paper clips are fine but honestly not some of the bigger and better ones you could find elsewhere with a little bit of extra searching. As long as you're just using them as intended for holding paper, they work great. I was shocked with how many paper clips I got when this came. So glad, I go thru paper clips like no tomorrow so won't need to spend money for a long time. I do not know how one can get paper clips that aren't, so the issue is price. Well, their paper clips. I mean a paper clip is a paper clip. These paper clips are good! I won't buy again, because I will never need to buy paper clips for as long as I live :p I like the non-skid paper clips. They grip the paper well with out falling off.
