So we leave this printer off and when we power it on, it is ready to print by the time we walk back to the pc! The Installation of the printer was relatively easy. The printer though, is not Airprint compliant, so you do have to download an app in order to print on your iphone and ipad. I was delighted to receive this printer to use and review. It sticks out about 2" and the printer still can print the paper. You might as well throw the printer out and buy a whole new one when you factor in the cost of replacing all of them. Glad this with be the printer that will get minimal use. I set the printer up to run wirelessly. The Samsung Wireless Color printer is the one that has worked for us. This printer is about twice as small as the smallest available color laser printer 10 years ago. I haven't had the printer long enough yet to comment on ink life, but again the print quality is great. So far, so good with this one.I'm too new to this printer to comment on ink life, but the description suggests it will be good.The unit IS rather big for a home printer, so just beware of that if you have limited space. It is looking like this printer is going to be WAY more expensive than even an inkjet. Stick the printer on your desk, behind you, across the room or house. Looked the same - so a sub $200 printer looks the same as the over $20,000 printer. Picked the printer (it was there instantly) set the options and printed. This one measures (I'm estimating) 19" wide x 16" in depth.This printer is a snap to hook-up and get it to connect wirelessly. Plus, the older printer was an inkjet, and frankly it was a pain to use because it was slow, the ink ran out quickly, and if I didn't use the printer for a while the ink would dry up.When it comes to setting up computer stuff, I'm dumb as a post. The printer claims that it'll make 1500 black and white pages; I've probably printed about 450-500 pages' worth of articles and the toner is out.

First off I want to say that this is a great printer.

I just wanted the printer to be wireless and the next step has you connecting to either the computer or with a network cable.

So is this printer.
