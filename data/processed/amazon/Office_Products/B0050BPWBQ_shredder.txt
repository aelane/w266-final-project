This is a good shredder, able to handle thicker items such as credit cards. Wanted to have a newer shredder because I wanted to pack some fine china and crystal for a future move and found that using shredded paper provided the extra cushion between the wrapped items to provide excellent protection. This shredder has easy to follow instructions and is compact enough that it fits nicely under my computer desk set up. The shredder fits well onto the basket, and you could easily rinse out the wastebasket portion. For the old cross-cut shredder unit I have (see link below) it make the strips smaller than 1/4 inch by 2 inches which makes it just about impossible to piece back together.STAPLES: I was very pleased with its ability to handle staples (they stay in tacked). oh I love this shredder this is my first one I've owned and so glad I picked this one. This shredder fits nicely in a tight spot under a table out of the way, not too big and not too small. and the shredder does a good job of destroying them. The shredder also does a good job with credit cards (no more having to use scissors to cut them!) Far less expensive than any comparable shredder I could find, the AmazonBasics does a fantastic job. This shredder has a lot going for it. First of all I compared it to my regular shredder (which does not have a cd shredder). It is a nice shredder and Amazon has a good warranty so I felt confident buying it. This shredder has no issue with those annoying credit card offers (unopened) and although it slows with each increase of paper, there is no hint of struggle until you get past the recommended 8 sheets. Overall, a good and quiet shredder for 1/4" strip-shredding. This is a good shredder, I used mine for about a year (light use) and then it stopped working. I hope my second shredder last longer than the first. This shredder works great, and it does indeed shred a credit card - i was kinda skeptical, but it does. I have a 10-sheet shredder I purchased at WalMart for about the same price as this one. When this Basics 8-Sheet shredder came available on Vine, I was happy to give it a try.The shredder and can are relatively petite, measuring 13.5" tall x 13" wide x 7" deep, and tucks nicely under the edge of my desk. The shredder top has a pull-out section, so if you want to use it with a larger can, it will fit up to a 15" wide opening.The operation is quieter than my WalMart cheapie, and sounds less like the metal gears are trying to chew each other up inside there. The CD/Credit Card shredder works perfectly, I was surprised at how effortlessly it chewed up a CD.The shredder feels solidly made, without being overly heavy. My old shredder had a sort of chute that would direct the paper so you could just sort of shove it in the general direction and it would work. Aurora AS810SD 8-Sheet Strip-Cut Paper/CD/Credit Card shredder ($29.99) is the same unit.BUT It seems to be overtaxed with a CD or Credit Card. NOTE THE Aurora AS810SD 8-Sheet Strip-Cut Paper/CD/Credit Card shredder:  It is EXACTLY the same unit (look at the pics!) The shredder works great. Likewise, if this shredder proves itself to be a shredder beyond shredders, a paragon of its species, I will be sure to give credit where credit is due. This is a handy little shredder for casual use in your home. I really like this little shredder. It's not a NSA approved crosscut shredder, but it shreds up my bills and scrap paper to add to my worm bin quite well.I
