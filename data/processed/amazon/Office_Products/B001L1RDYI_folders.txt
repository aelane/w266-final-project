Just when I needed to add some new folders to my ever-expanding file system, I saw these on Amazon. These folders have an extra large tab area which allows me to place extended titles in the tabs. These are nice folders. When I need more folders I will order these again. I use file folders daily, so I try to get as high quality ones as possible so they last. I suppose if you use them rarely and just want some tabbed folders to store paperwork, they'd be fine, but if you use the folders often they don't feel like they'll hold up too well. These are GREAT folders! These folders are as advertised. Not much to say about these, they are file folders after all.The larger tabs are great, and work well with Avery 5160 size labels. Normally I use plain folders or I might come into possession of a colored folder because someone gave me one but I've never bought colored ones before. I received the SuperTab folders that are standard letter in size and they have pastel colors.
