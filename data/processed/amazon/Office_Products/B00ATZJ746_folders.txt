These folders provide a unique alternative to traditional horizontal filing and will allow you to highlight folders of more import by tipping them vertical. The folders don't necessarily feel any heavier than most folders, but the laminate makes them seem more substantial.Despite how nice these folders are, I think they could be a bit more affordable....somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.5 a piece would be fair. I still found that I prefer to use folders that open fully because I found myself taking all the papers out of these folders to find what I needed. These folders are made of a heavy weight glossy paper. These folders are open on 2 ends only. Smead's new heavyweight vertical folders are of really nice quality and quite convenient to use. The folders are a slick finish which makes them a little more durable, you could wipe them clean from smudges and  dirt. If you don't keep too much in your folders, this isn't an issue.4.5 stars These folders are basically just that... something to hold your paperwork in. The folders contain 100% recycled content, or which 30% is from post-consumer sources.The card stock is glossy on the outside, and has a sort of eggshell finish within. Recommended if you want vertical folders, and if the price is right for you. (I actually went through all 6 folders in about 4 months, because they ripped on one end/corner, from trying to find a single paper discreetly without pulling out the full folder. When I store these folders at landscape orientation within theSmead MO File Box, the vertical tab extends to a nearly exact fit, without a sliver of additional space to spare.These folders are thick and durable, and they have a smooth, almost shiny outer finish. Smead's Organized Up folders are built to withstand substantial use. These are excellent folders. I thought this would be perfect for me because I take folders back and forth between my desk and backpack and you would be able to read the labels with the folder pointed in either direction. These folders are great for transporting documents. These folders hold a decent amount of paper as well (they're advertised to hold 25 sheets and will hold at least this much).I knew these folders were going to be "heavyweight" but I was still surprised by just how durable they are. These Smead Organized UP Heavyweight File folders are designed primarily for vertical rather than horizontal use, making them ideal for a backpack or paper sorter or rack. These folders also have the "Certified Fiber Sourcing" label from the Sustainable Forestry Initiative which indicates that "program participants must show that the raw material in their supply chain comes from legal and responsible sources" and that the primary fiber producer is third-party audited to ensure compliance with basic sustainable forestry standards. The folders come in varying shades of blue or green allowing you to easily find what you need.Recommend. If you carry file folders in a back pack or briefcase or other bag, these file folders are great. The folders are heavyweight and can withstand the turmoil of a backpack with ease nor will not disintegrate if they get damp when you're caught in an unexpected rain shower. It would be too distracting to use these folders at home and then go into the office, where they are still using old-school file folders, and expect my eyes and hands to immediately adapt back to using the old style of file folders. The folders make some aspects of dealing with files easier and some harder so it really depends on you needs when determining if these will help.The folders are vertical folders and closed on the bottom and side in and L shaped fashion. These folders allow you to look at papers from top to bottom since they are vertical. With horizontal folders, which are closed on one side, it is easy to review the papers while in the folders. The folders are sturdy.If you like the idea of vertical folders these are great. The Smead Organized UP folders have a glossy exterior. These folders would be much better if they did something about the tab situation and if they could fit the office furniture I already have. These Smead folders are unusual in that you can file them vertically or horizontally. Tabs allow you to label the folders regardless of their orientation. If filed horizontally, then these folders are slightly taller than the average manila folder, but they fit into filing cabinet drawers. The folders are made of a sturdy water-resistant 100% recycled material; I think that they will withstand use. These folders are closed on one end in addition to the normal closed, creased end.The folders can be stored horizontally in your file cabinet just like any other file folder.They are a heavier weight than your run of the mill file folders and seem like they will hold up for a long, long time.

These sturdy folders are closed on three sides as opposed to two sides.

The folders are temporary - once the project is complete, I rifle through each project file, toss the paper that I won't need again and PDF the rest.

I've carried several of these Smead folders around in my backpack for a few weeks and they hold up well - sure, a few crunched corners from being pushed around in my pack, but they are stiff enough to take daily insertion and removal from a stuffed backpack.What I like about them:Cool colorsDurable - tougher than normal foldersUnique two sided openingWhat I don't like about them:The two side opening means that to find a specific document, it is easier to remove ALL the papers to find it.
