You can get free templates for this label on the Avery website, but you do have to register with them to get their downloads. And just like in Publisher, they have both blank templates and templates preloaded with designs. Just go to Design & Print Online under the templates menu and enter product number 22804. The templates provided by Avery were useless on this product. I just wanted the templates for these labels, and searching for them would yield all sorts of hits of support Q&A;, etc. But I did appreciate the numerous available templates once I finally got there.The web interface did require me to set up an account, but only minimal information was required, an email address (I provided a disposable email address) and a name (any name). They've got multiple templates and ideas on-line that really helped me come up with a unique, custom label. The templates online are easy to use or you can make your own with word.

"You can download Microsoft Word-compatible templates from Avery's website BUT I don't personally recommend this, simply because you will drive yourself completely out of your ever-loving mind trying to figure out how to print just ONE label.

Avery does provide ample templates online for Microsoft Word as well as a online design interface.

The templates are easy to use and you can easily produce perfect labels for whatever purpose you choose.
