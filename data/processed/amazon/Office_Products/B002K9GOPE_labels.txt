And, I have to say, I would choose these labels just for how easy they are to peel from the sheet. We tested out these labels and found they worked well for us.Good:- Worked fine with existing 5160 templates.- Adhesive works well.- Easy to peel from sheet (page is meant to be creased and then edges of lables stick out for easy grabbing.- Reasonable price.Bad: nothing so far.We've used Avery, Staples, and other bulk generic brands of these labels. These labels are the best of the bunch, probably tying with Avery brand for ease of use and adhesive strength. These labels run well through our laser printer. They're just address labels--how much is there to say? Nice labels! Compatible with Avery 5160 labels, if you use the Avery or other programs that use Avery template #s.These labels are sturdy, yet are more flexible, and can reposition on paper and other surfaces.They are marked "laser", yet they work very well with inkjet printers as well.The flexibility of these labels leads to less jamming than other labels! I use mailing labels to send out Christmas cards and to create gift labels. Other labels are so stiff I have to use the direct feed tray. I have a Phaser and these labels work perfectly on that printer. The labels are easy to peel off from the backing, but they won't come off accidentally while being printed in the laser printer.I downloaded the template file (3M Template 3100-A.doc) for this label from [...]/labels and first tried to test print on plain paper. I got these labels for my holiday cards, since I mail over 100 each year. These labels were particularly good because they were ever so slightly wider than the labels I used last year. They are thinner than other labels, but have plenty of strength and adhesive to stick to packages and folders.The best part? These labels work great with my laser printer and they stay where you put them. "If you are like me and have had labels fall off after a year or more, this is the product for you. The labels are a decent size, so it is easy to fit longer addresses on the labels. I just finished making mailing labels for my Christmas cards with these and they turned out nice. These labels are the same as Avery item #5160. These labels are compatible with Avery 5160, so when formatting a document in Word, WP or Works, the Avery template can be used. These labels appear to be slightly more opaque than the shipping labels I also reviewed, but if you are applying these labels to something other than white envelopes, the underside envelope design shows through. With the white labels over red envelopes, for example, the red shows through. These labels fill the bill nicely. They're also handy for labels to place in books to identify the owner in case someone borrows a book. These labels worked really well. As I've had smudging with some labels and not others using the same printer, I watch carefully for label quality and a lack of smudging when I try a new brand. These 3M labels passed the test with minimal to no smuding as soon as the page came off the laser printer. The labels also have a strong, permanent adhesive that adheres solidly to plain or more glossy, waterproof envelopes. They match up with the ubiquitous Avery 5160 labels, so getting your program to work with them should be easy.I have tested them with an HP LaserJet 4+ printer, which was perfect, as I expected. I use these little labels to stamp my return address on utility bills, letters, etc. This labels are great because you can print them on your printer using your contacts from your computers to avoid adresses mintakes and to make clearer writing than with hand writing.You can use then for single envelopes or for multi mailing and they fit perfectly on microsoft's word templates.They are very usefull to for organizing and for inventory of goods.Highly recommended for home and office use. Just as advertised, these 3M labels are easy to use, easy to print on, stay stuck once you place them and look good. I've used Avery labels in the past and these are as good or better. Great labels. These are great address labels...easy to format and easy to peel off once printed. I used these labels with a Canon Pixma MP780 Inkjet and they went through and came out nice and neat. The labels are comparable to Avery products, and is a good choice for your mailing needs. The labels and the Word program lend themselves to this kind of use with much grace.I believe they represent a really good value from Amazon and can recommend them highly. Avery labels are slightly more expensive with little or no discernible quality difference that I can see.Bottom line, they work as well or better than other labels I have used in the past.P-) These 3M labels are great! The labels are easy to remove from the page because the border edges are already removed from the wax paper. I would definitely recommend these labels for home or office use. I have been very pleased with these labels. These labels are easy to run through my laser printer using the standard Avery 5160 template. We print labels for the local humane society so we print a lot. However, you don't need to use these labels with a printer. These labels work as they should, with no annoyances like laser printer misfeeds, hard-to-peel labels, or labels that come off of mail or packages. Although I have used Avery labels for years, I was happy to try this 3M Permenent Adhesive Address Labels. I have been using Avery 5160 or compatible labels for years. The first is the labels being made too thick to where they jam into my printer. The 3M labels had none of these problems. You'll have more labels and more time. These are great labels... print well and have "crisp" text with no smudging.They stay in place once placed onto an envelope or shipping box!These are the best print at home labels I have tried (and believe me I have tried them all! I've always used the Avery labels in the past, and while they were ok. At 1" x 2 5/8", it's not very generous and I already had a few (US) addresses that don't fit on these labels. There are 30 labels per sheet, 750 per package, and are suitable for both laser & inkjet printers. I highly recommend these 3M labels. Excel), you can attempt to do a Mail Merge.After you get all that filled out, you can insert the labels into your printer. After it is lined up well, you're ready to print!- It says these labels are meant for Laser printers. So you can get away with using these labels on your inkjet printer, but for the best results, these should be used on Laser printers. Not much else to say about address labels but don't hestitate to purchase this - it is a great, quality product. A LOT of labels. All the labels before have been the same as the rest. These labels are nothing fancy, but they stick very well and work quite nicely for mailing. The labels can be fed by sheet into a printer so that you can print out sets of labels. There are 750 labels per pack. If you like to print labels using a template, the Avery address label 5160 template will work just fine with this 3M product.A nice user friendly feature of the address labels is the Quick Lift design, which eliminates the hassle of trying to peel the label off of the sheet. These labels are the best I have used in a long time. I highly recommend these labels! I have been using Avery labels in the past and these 3M labels are as good as those Avery ones at a cheaper price. I can also use my old Avery templates with these labels. Usually I use the Avery Brand of labels, and when these came I was so excited to see that they have printed the compatible Avery label number right on each sheet. These particular labels correspond to Avery 5160. These 3M labels on the other hand work perfectly. Not only do the labels come off faster and easier, you don't run the risk of damaging or ruining the label by "picking" at it to get it off the sheet.And of course they adhere like nobody's business. 30 labels on a page, in three columns of ten. I thought these labels had an excellent quality once printed on. I often have my labels smudge because the label itself doesn't retain the ink well. These labels were easy to set up, worked well with the Avery templates. They do seem to be more "sticky" then the Avery labels, but I did have some smudging (printing with inkjet). Quite often when I print labels there is a discrepancy between the labels on the page and the presets in Word. These labels printed perfectly the first time. I usually use Avery labels, but these 3M 1 x 2 5/8ths inch labels are just as good. If you use an Avery Template Add-in to print labels (such as with WORD) then select Avery Template 5160 for these, and you'll be all set!My advise, find the best price on either the 3M or Avery version of these, and go with the brand that costs you less - as both work equally well. These new 3M labels are the best I've tried. Excellent labels. The labels are easy to print on, with strong adhesive. These labels worked well with my laser printer, a Brother MFC-9840CDW.The template was nice and converted without any issues to OpenOffice, lining up perfectly.I would buy this again. The labels printed easily, looked great and pulled off and attached properly.This product did what it is supposed to do...printed, attached and stayed attached. The labels were easily peeled off the paper, didn't have to wedge my nail under there to get them up. I am also going to use them as labels for my DVD collection. I used these labels with an inkjet printer even though they are labeled for laser. These labels are great. These labels are simply excellent.Right off the bat, printing with laser and inkjet printers produced very sharp text, which really helps to keep you from looking like... well... someone printing out labels out of their basement on an inkjet printer. The labels printed out with perfect alignment first try!The finish of the labels is a little more like plain paper, and less like Avery's more polished surface, but this really didn't matter to me in a mailing label. These are good labels, fairly-priced, and do what they are supposed to. Probably 3-4000 labels a week. The labels work very for me. These labels are great. These labels are cheaper then Avery and work well but do not work as efficiently with Word.N
