The template does NOT guarantee that alignment will be perfect. You could never tell where you were on the template. The Avery template is much more visual and user friendly and allows you to print a couple of labels, and then print more at a later time. Quite frankly, without this template, this product would not be very user friendly and a waste of money.Trying to think of another use, I decided to use these to label my daughter's moving boxes so that I can clear up my basement and get her ready to move out. I tried the template and the labels worked very nicely without any software adjustment (Mac running 10.6.2, Word 2008, and HP printers). The template I use is Avery 5366 and it displays a page of 30 labels. I used the template to print about 5 labels for some of my file folders and even included some icons/logos and they came out great. Locating the correct template on 3M's website was as simple as inputting 2100-H into the search box.I printed these labels using my laser printer -- the output turned out perfectly.Pros:- Removable! In using the Post-it template, text is positioned justified left, very close to the left end of the label. I also tried out the Avery template as these were said to be compatible. The Avery template justified center, resulting in a less crowded appearance without additional formatting. I preferred the Avery template, especially for using with student materials.Both templates print accurately in alignment with tabs on page. The template in Microsoft Word worked just fine, and printing on a Canon MF-series laser was also without issues. I ended up having to take them to work and print from a LaserJet-- that worked perfectly.Secondly, when I went into MS Word 2007 and searched for "Post-it", it did not find a matching template. Finding and downloading the proper template was easy as pie. I used Microsoft Office Word 2007 Avery 5366 template and it worked great. The template provided by the post-it site was easy to use, although I would have preferred guidelines or similar to let me know where the individual tabs are. Compatible with Avery template for 5366. I downloaded the template from the website before the labels even arrived, and when I received them, just popped them into the printer and voila, instant tabs for my files. The template is likely already available in your word processing application and in the event it's not, there is an easy to download version available on Post-it's website. The template works just fine as an Open Office document and I've had none of the printer problems others have reported. The Word template I downloaded from the Post-It web site for these Super Sticky Removable File Folder Labels worked flawlessly, and the sheets of labels went through my laser printer with no problems. I was able to use a free template from their website and print my first sheet of labels in just a few minutes. Getting the right template took two clicks of a mouse and the MS Word file came right up on my computer. I used the Avery 5366 easy-to-follow template to print my sheet of labels in the manual feed tray of my laser all-in-one printer. I have Mac Leopard OS X 10.5.8 and Pages '09 4.0.3.--For those that are picky, the template is slightly off in Pages - centered left to right, but prints slightly below center top to bottom (when formatted centered top-to-bottom) on each label.
