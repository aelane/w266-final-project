What a nifty lil product. Wish I had this product 3 years ago. This is one outstanding product. Wow, a product that actually works! I got this product because it promised to remove ghosting, permanent marker, and other things with just water. Also, because the product description states that the eraser will erase permanent marker, I of course had to test this out. This is priced like a premium product compared to the traditional dry-erase erasers, especially if you buy those during the back to school sales. Good product and it works, but I guess I thought it would work a little better on permanent marker. I like this product. I highly recommend this product. Overall a good product though. This product works better than other methods and whiteboard erasers I've used over the years.This actually seems to be a variation of the 3M Scotch-Brite Easy Erasing Pad (which competes with the Mr. Clean Magic Eraser in the home and commercial cleaning product market and is available here on Amazon as of March 2012). This product works similarly to the Magic Eraser cleaner. So I would say this product is good to try on an expensive whiteboard that has unerasable marks -- but don't expect a miracle. I have to admit, when I received this product I was a bit skeptical. It works, it works very well and I will purchase this product when the one I have wears out. Not much more to say, nice product. This new product will even remove permanent marker, if you accidentally get it on your white board. You will find this product, money well-spent! another 3m 5star product. We've used this product dry at first to clean off the board, then moistened it with water to rub clean a couple slight stains. Great product from a great company. Great product that does what it's supposed to very well. I was very impressed with this product. The product worked as indicated. I would recommend this product. 3M Whiteboard Eraser for Permanent Markers and Whiteboards, 5 Inches x 3 Inches x 1.2 Inches, 2 Pads/Pack (581-WBE)seems to be a good product. Overall, this product works the way it is intended. It is a good product with no chemical smell and little mess. The 3M product worked like a champ. I was hoping that this product would erase the marks on my dry erase boards that won't come off with my usual paper-towel-and-rubbing-alcohol method. So this product doesn't do much more than my much cheaper paper towel and alcohol method. Super product and super price! I moved on to the 3M product and it also started removing the permanent marker, even though it was dry, but there was no streaking. This product works well, so no complaints. This product works well with minimum effort & the board looks as good as new.
