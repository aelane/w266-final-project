I expected him to hook the printer up with no problem but even he had some problems trying to make the computer communicate with the printer.I'm very happy with the printer once it was properly set up but ease of set up wireless? I love this printer! I have this printer and I also had the 2140 before it. You cannot use the printer until you replace the cartridge.As I said earlier I had the Brother 2140 which was the prior non wireless version. Now that I have this printer setup, it works great. I found it mildly frustrating to configure the printer. This is not some magical printer. It was because I needed a printer immediately.Anyway, safe yourself a lot of stress. I set this printer up from unboxing to printing on 2 computers wirelessly (Mac & PC) in under 30 minutes.That is a far cry different than what it took me to set-up aCanon PIXMA MP560 Wireless Inkjet All-In-One Photo Printer (3747B002)recently. Quiet, fast, clear, and easy to maintain.Definitely RECOMMEND this printer. I have the printer in my office and connected it directly to my PC with the USB cable. I was able to connect wirelessly directly between the printer and laptop without going through the router. Try as I may, I could not connect the printer through the router like my other Brother Inkjet. Therefore, I can not blame the printer for something that is my fault. Since I do have the printer wired to the other printer in the office and that printer is connected to the router, then I can still access the laser printer through the other computer.I am still giving the Brother 2170W printer high marks because, except for the connection problems, it is an excellent printer.UPDATE: I was trying to setup the printer wirelessly, without plugging the cable in. I finally decided to wire the printer to the router as recommended in the manual. It is slightly louder than my last printer but my last printer died in 9 months so maybe a little more noise is good. It was an economical printer while it lasted, which was almost 4 years, but every time I printed from it, my voltage regulators would trip. Fortunately, since the printer lives a couple of feet from my Linksys wireless router, I could skip using the built in wi-fi and potentially a lot of time and headaches. This printer is no exception. This printer is close to plug-and-play with just a simple (and mercifully small) driver package to install. 'Bought this printer in 2008 and here it is 2013 and I am still using this printer. Turn off the printer. Then I killed my printer by putting something through that I shouldn't. As a wired printer, it's affordable and works great.
