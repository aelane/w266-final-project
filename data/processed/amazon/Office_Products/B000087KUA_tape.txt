Shipping tape is expensive no matter which brand or style you buy. You can probably get cheaper tape, but the time you save in not having misfires during application is a huge time saver. I would call it as thick as tape should be, and the rest are unnecessarily cheaply thin. We've all used this tape so what could possibly be better about this newest type?Well, I'm here to tell you that it is actually stronger. When shipping tape doesn't hold any better than Magic Tape, what's the point? I use this tape to attach PayPal labels to my packages as well as taping the packages themselves. They work very well, and the clear tape allows me to use paper labels rather than more expensive self-stick labels. What I like about this tape that it is not as thin as some other packaging tapes I tried, so it is easier to control - it lays evenly where I put it and does not stick with bubbles or to itself.Given Amazon's excellent return policy and a statement from the manufacturer that they will remedy the problem (posted as a reply to some of the complaints) this product is worth a try. This tape is excellent, but I dare I say it is almost TOO sticky. The tape also cuts easy and doesn't roll-up into itself. The tape I got sticks to the dispenser too well and if I can get the tape on the package it will stick there too. It seems the tape gets too strongly attached to the dispenser part to release. Voila, this tape does really well in that dispenser. I have received the exact same tape from a friend that placed an order on Amazon and just had spare tapes laying around.I tried it out for 3 months, most of the packages are being shipped overseas. Very strong tape! the tape isn't too thick and doesn't gum up scissors when cut. we used this tape to help my brother move stuff to the basement, and it held 20lb boxes with just one strip across the bottom. This is great tape! We use it with a tape gun and have no problems and occasionally we use it straight from a plain roll.After some disastrous experiences with a couple of off-brands we always use Scotch. I've been using this tape for a couple years now and I've been happy with it's secure bond. I will not be purchasing this tape again, or any 3M brand packaging tapes for a while, in the hopes that they correct this problem. Certainly this is very strong tape. I've been using this tape for years now and won't buy anything else. We have used the 3M 3850 tape for years and find it easy to work with, excellent adhesion and very strong. This Scotch / 3M tape is nice and thick so it is very easy to cut and use without the problems that come with thin inexpensive packing tape.Good stuff, I would certainly buy it over some of the less expensive stuff I have used in the past. I've been buying my tape from a shipping supply company for the past few years. This tape is strong; I wouldn't use any other for packing as a little bit goes a long way. I've used Scotch packing tape for years. I only use Scotch tape for my packages. The cheaper tape wrinkles up or you lose it on the roll and can't find where to start peeling again. I like using this stronger tape as it just takes one pass. This is the best tape for a multitude of uses. The very thin, cheaper tape can be a nightmare. Even as you peel the tape off the roll, you can feel that it's thicker and stronger than standard packing tape. When that happens, less secure tape may lift up off the box, breaking the seal.We've all received packages where it is clearly a miracle the contents are still there because the box is essentially wide open. You can rely on this tape to hold up under shipping. Brown packing tape looks better when reusing boxes, especially for covering previous shipping labels, but you should always have the clear stuff around too, as its useful for affixing loose shipping labels when you dont have a sticker or pouch.This tape is definitely heavy-duty, which is good not just for securing packages, but its also easier to handle as it doesn't fold back onto itself like cheap tape.For general purpose, I still stick to the cheap brown generic tape, but will absolutely keep a few rolls on this on hand as needed. This tape actually helps me get rid of that issue. I like to use the tape also to laminate over shipping labels to keep them on, and it works wonderfully.Scotch makes the best tape, and this shipping tape is sure to meet your most demanding shipping needs. Regular tape will tangle, fold back over, stick to itself and cause untold grief and frustration. This tape has a thickness and stiffness to it that will eliminate all that. I do not have a tape gun to test this in but I expect that you would need one with an excellent cutter blade due to the extra thickness of this tape. Though the tape is thicker, it does not sacrifice much in terms of plyability so I think it would still be able to conform to any odd shaped items you needed to tape-for example if you wanted to mummify my former boss... This tape is strong and clear and doesn't curl up. Instead of tearing it just pulls out more and more tape until I have a piece much longer than I need and I have to tear it manually. Yes, it is strong and clear but it REFUSES to be cut in the tape gun. Worst packing tape I've ever used, and I've used TONS over many years. This is seriously thick tape that sticks to just about anything and is much stronger than other domestic packing tapes on the market. I like this tape because it is thick. I have used pretty much every tape out there (but I admit I usually buy what is on sale). I do find it exceptionally thick and well-behaved in that it goes where I want it to and does not move around nor wrinkle very much.But this tape simply does not seem all that strongly adhesive to me. This Scotch tape is so thick that you don't have those sorts of problems. If you try to use this tape for Duct Tape type applications you will be disappointed in the lack of stickiness on some surfaces. This tape does not exhibit any of those problems.When shopping for packing tape, I make my selection based on what bad things it doesn't do, rather than seeking any particular 'performance' attributes. Because this tape doesn't do any of the bad things that many other packing tapes do, I strongly recommend it. This tape is great! I guess I've been using cheap tape over the years. This Scotch tape comes off the roll with practically zero memory, which makes it very easy to handle. This tape is as sticky as can be, and I've never had issues with it not being sticky enough. It's great tape and holds packages closed. Excellent tape. Also, it fit into my tape dispenser easily (but that's probably b/c of some universal size for these sorts of things). Also, I find the tape to be almost imperceptively thicker than usual, and solid enough that it doesn't snap/break if you try and break it.I recommend this product. I go through a LOT of packing tape so I thought I would give the Scotch Super Strength Packing Tape a try.Y
