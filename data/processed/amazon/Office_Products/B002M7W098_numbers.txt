However, given the numbers "1" to "10" are short, for many purposes like my hymnbook they could be printed so they are the right way up when the book is upright. The numbers stick out from the files/pages. If we do not like using those preset numbers, we could make our own using a label maker and tape over it. The Note/Tabs set I've tried has numbers on the tab, but I believe you can get them without or with letters. The numbers are in the actual tab part and they are clear, bolded in black and centered on a white background.These would also be very useful in legal briefings when you have several points to make and you want the section of backup material to reflect point number 3, for instance.Two packets of tabs numbered 1-10 are included. I really like these...the numbers are just a twist on the other tabs which are un-numbered. The numbers work great for highlighting the page I want to use for lessons. The numbers are large and in black centered on the tabs, so you'd have to squeeze notes on either side if you wanted to knowwhat the number stood for / extra info on the tabs. All of the numbers are on just a white background  so there's no visualcolor cue if you wanted that. the numbers only go up to 10, but there are 2 sets so you can easily edit the 2nd set with a black sharpie to go from 11-19. they are thick and sturdy, so easy to grab and use for turning to the location you need. The numbers are large and bold so there's no chance of losing track of what you labeled.
