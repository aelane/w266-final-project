There isn't that much to say about a file folder. Perfect for putting in a file drawer where you need things to stand up straight. These can be carried individually or added to a file cabinet. I've never seen these before -- file folders that expand to hold a couple of inches worth of documents. However, this does mean that if the file is not filled all the way (with a smaller stack of papers), then the file is thicker than the papers and gets bent or squished if handled too roughly.All in all, I'm glad I got these and I would get them again when I run out. The expandable file jacket will fit into the file cabinet. These are effective file folders. Wider would probably be more useful if I were going to use them to replace my open file system.

I was tired of my regular file folders because whenever I went to shuffle them around papers would come loose and fall out of the folders.

I prefer closed sided file jackets.

Also nice if your file has gotten a little larger than a normal folder can handle.
