The perforated pages allow me to easily remove it and put it in the file it belongs in,  No more frantic search in the piles of paper on my desk! This means no more cutting pages to try to get them to &#34;fit&#34; after they are printed, no trying to clip the edges of printed pages of edges, no more trying to crop pictures so they will fit. You get 100 pages of college-ruled paper, which is perforated so you can cleanly tear out a sheet if need be. The pages were the white college-ruled paper we are used to. &#8226;easy tear out pages&#8226;very sturdy plastic cover&#8226;pockets are in the front of the notebook right behind the cover&#8226;the back of the notebook is a thick cardboard, not the plastic cover materialA winner! The perforated pages tear cleanly with a fold on the perforation, but will not tear out with daily use. They had about 40 pages and a cardboard cover. At 100 pages, you have enough paper top cover a subject (many four or five subject notebooks have half this number of pages per subject). The pages have straight-edge perfs, the spiral is strong, the cover durable.

The pages are perforated but they don't come apart unless you tear them.

The pages can be removed due to the perforated edges.
