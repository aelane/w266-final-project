The paper is smooth. Although the paper in the notebook is strong, it would be nice if a slightly heavier paper had been used. The paper is college ruled and 3 hole punched.Biggest plus? The paper itself is a good quality and I love that each sheet is perforated for easy, clean removal from the notebook. The paper is easy to write on and it's big but not cumbersome. Easy to tear the paper out with a clean edge. The paper covers were really sturdy, but rain damage was always a concern. The paper is die-cut, so if you want to remove pages and place them in a three-ring binder, you can pull them out cleanly. The paper is smooth, but holds ink. The paper is of very high quality with easy tear perforations if you need to tear out a page without worrying about having a shaggy edge and standard rulings. I have found the paper to be much stronger than other notebooks I've used and I don't have the problem of pages ripping easily (especially on the outside edge and corners). The paper is moderately bright and somewhat thin, noticeably more grey than my 97 brightness printer paper. The paper is typical lined paper used in notebooks of this type. Although the paper is not as thick as some would like that is actually a good feature since it keeps the notebook from being too heavy and bulky. Anyway, the paper is decent, although I would not write on it with a pen that bleeds heavily, because it may go thru (which is always a risk). The paper, well, it's definitely not made like it used to be. The paper is college ruled, which I prefer, and the spiral binding wire is locked at each end. The paper is good quality.
