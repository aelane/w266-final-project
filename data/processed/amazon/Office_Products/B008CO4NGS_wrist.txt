Oddly, I also own the wrist pad, and it does not smell nearly as much. It helps keep my wrist from hurting.The Fellowes Wrist Rest is just as good. Apparently, Fellowes thinks you don't need a wrist rest when you are doing the 10-keys, since the rest gets even narrower on the right hand side. My previous wrist rest tore in the middle after a few years, so I needed a new one. But other than that, it's a good wrist rest! Of these, Fellows Wrist Rest seems softer, more flexible and definitely more comfortable than the other wrist rests I have tried. I REALLY prefer this gel wrist rest over all others. If you're looking for a wrist pad for your keyboard, this works great. This wrist rest is well-priced and works very well with a desktop computer. This is a well-priced, well-made wrist rest and I recommend. I was glad to see this offered on Vine, because my previous wrist rest had become annoying. With the PlushTouch wrist rest, Fellowes has made a compelling alternative to the traditional gel type. While I like this particular wrist rest, I'd probably consider a different one with similar properties in order to find one that actually did sit flat. If you already  have wrist pain, this wrist rest will help reduce it or at least keep it at bay and not aggrevate it. The wrist rest is comfortable and is great for preventing fatigue and straining of wrist while typing on the keyboard, however, I spend much of my time using the mouse and the wrist rest works but gets cumbersome after continued use. Now I use the wrist rest for all typing that I perform on the computers keyboard and no longer use with the mouse. Unlike my previous wrist rest, which was made of a vinyl type material, my wrists do not stick to this product.
