This is a nice looking, lightweight printer. I purchased this printer a month ago and though it does print wirelessly, it often takes an extremely long time. This Brother printer is one of the best that's entered our doorway. Having never experienced a Brother printer before, I was a little shocked at the ink. It will be interesting when I need to refill it.As far as set up, this Brother All in One printer set up pretty easily on my Mac, which is rarely the case with printers and my mac. The printer is a bit large and it's not portable, so find a good spot for this to stay. I certainly think that this Brother printer is an excellent value compared with what the HP retailed for two years ago. This printer surprised me in that it is everything I wanted in an inexpensive unit. I needed a new printer to replace a really old HP that had recently started to act funny (had trouble with the cartridges being recognized)... I have printed to the printer from iPhone and iPad 2. I was able to get this printer up and running in less than 10 minutes. This Brother Work Smart printer is perfect for my office space. I love the printer overall and highly recommend it. I decided to upgrade to this printer after I upgraded my Mac to Mavericks (OSX 10.9). Still love the printer! My first printer for my Mac was my old HP which served me for years. I told them I was switching to Epson.The Epson printer gave me nothing but problems. I switched back to HP.My last HP printer used a black cartridge and tri-color cartridge with built-in print heads, the 74X and 75X. This printer is amazing. But, I am almost ready to chuck my HP printer for good and switching to Brother. This seems obvious, but I've used other printer touch screens that required a fair amount of pressure and that had poor image quality. I love this printer. I would highly recommend this printer if you are looking for wireless printing. I like this printer, it is inexpensive but loaded with features. It is supposed to be frugal on printer ink usage and inexpensive to replace cartridges. I am glad I bought this Brother printer over an HP printer.However, there are a few issues with this Brother printer. Once I knew the printer worked, I then reinstalled the software and set it up for Wireless. For a home-use printer your cartridges will probably dry before you run out.

I really appreciate this printer's capabilities.

On this printer, it actually sucks the paper back in after printing one side, and then prints the other before spitting it out.

Lesser recognized printer brands like Brother, Samsung, Canon, etc.
