Who'd think to design an ELEGANT ink jet printer? I've had other ink jet printers where I'd have to buy a whole new color cartridge if just one ink color was low. The ink division of Epson is their most profitable (I've heard), so they aren't hurt if you have to buy more (just your wallet).Also, I wish it was white...the black shiny looks sort of old-school and not in a good way. The ink seems to last a long time and the print is very crisp. The ink is reasonably priced and really does last a long time.I am an Epson fan and will always use their products for photos. The Epson ink cartridges used in this printer are fewer in number and considerably lower in price.It is also an energy saver, as the printer uses up to 70 percent less power than laser printers.These are the features I like the best:  two-sided copying, the speed at which it copies, the 500-sheet paper capacity, scanning photos or documents and faxing capabilities, and the 7.8" touch panel. I checked, and the generic ink as well as the brand name last for about the same quantity of pages (about 500 pages for a standard ink cartridge and with the lowest quality printing).Overall, this printer is completely underpriced for the many features it has and the ease of use it exudes. I got some ink on amazon for cheaper then in the stores that I looked at Target Walmart Best Buy. Best Buy is the most expensive for the ink...Target was close to Amazon pricing but listed at on sale the day I looked. Install the ink cartridges and insert paper. The ink did go down by a noticeable amount, but all printers do when you print out photos. The ink isn't quite affordable enough to make this an economical daily use printer, but it's a great specialty printer, and has other capabilities that I need, that my Kodak does not. The instant dry ink it uses is also perfect for two-sided jobs and I have yet to experience any unsightly smudging. I'm anxious (but not really) to see how long the ink lasts. I would like the ink to dry faster on fancy photo paper...but again, not heavily concerned.Overall five stars! With the Canon we were replacing the black ink cartridges nearly every two to three weeks, even under less heavy use. The ink seems to have increased density and resolution so both pictures and text look much better.The only let down is the touch-screen interface. I still believe their ink prices are pretty high, and as I said before this printer itself is gigantic, but because of it's functionality and performance I can highly recommend it. It's almost 2012, and the current ink system is really outdated.Even though "Extra High-capacity Cartridges" are sold, the small savings are measured in comparison to color laser printers, which are in different league than standard inkjets. Once the ink cartridges are clicked into place, the printer will "prime" them for up to five minutes (mine took about 90 seconds. Priming does use some ink, but does not automatically print a test page unless asked. This is much faster and wastes far less ink than the obligatory alignment, print test page, copy test page that you go through when you change the ink on a similar HP printer.Setting up the printer (language, date, time) and the software on the computer, was fast and painless. One was that the cyan ink totally stopped working and cleaning nor new ink resolved. I no longer keep extra ink in stock in the office because of the issues i've been having lately.The downside of Epson printers are the way they have the inks setup. The ink capacity is amazing, as is speed, and most significantly the quality. It doesn't seem to consume more ink than any others in its class, but uses plenty of it. I tend to recycle my own ink using injector kits, but Epson cartridges are more tamper-proof than others. I love that the ink colors are individually tanked so that if one runs out I don't have to lose the remains of the rest in order to restore full color (a complaint from my old machines).
