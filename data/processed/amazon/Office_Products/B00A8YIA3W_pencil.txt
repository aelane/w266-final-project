I love a good electric pencil sharpener. Like all electric pencil sharpeners I have used, I can usually tell when it's done being sharpened anyways, so it's not like this sharpener feels any differently to me. And I have to say, if I were to go buy an electric pencil sharpener, I'd just as soon find one that costs less than this, considering the quailty and how it works. I have always liked to try using a pencil until it is just a little stub. Auto shut off when pencil is completely sharpened." However, if you're looking for a pencil sharpener that will do all of the things that this product description currently claims that it will do, you will likely be disapointed. I never saw that in a pencil sharpener.Bottom of clear front --holds the chips fro the pencil. When my new pencil sharpener arrived in the mail, I immediately plugged it in and sharpened my pencils. It doesn't bother me that the pencil sharpener only does pencils of one size, but for some people, this might be an issue. I would recommend it!UPDATE 2/13/14:I have owned a few different pencil sharpeners over the past few years, and most of them end up in my classroom. I have never had a pencil sharpener make such a sharp point, all the while being quick, quiet, and just overall awesome. It's not too loud, makes your pencil sharp, and doesn't slide around when you use it. Overall a good pencil sharpener that seems rugged enough for the price, we'll have to let time tell the rest. This electric pencil sharpener isn't portable, since it has to be plugged in, but that's a small sacrifice considering the speed and convenience it offers. I have had several electric pencil sharpeners before this one. This is the best electric pencil sharpener for home use that I have ever tried, and I've tried a lot! What I can tell you is that this can sharpen a new pencil in less than three seconds, and is relatively quiet (for an electric pencil sharpener). If you insert a pencil and keep pushing, you will be left with nothing more than an eraser. It's not the most attractive pencil sharpener ever made, but as Jeremy Clarkson might say, Damn, that was quick! Yet so far, it hasn't.-It can be messy removing the pencil shavings. I am not sure how much you can say about a pencil sharpener except that it work and works well. This is a heavy-duty electric pencil sharpener. Most pencil sharpeners sharpen unevenly. I can turn a new pencil into a stub if I don't pull it out. This pencil sharpener can sit on a table or desk and has a long cord that plug in to the wall. So far, this has been a nice pencil sharpener and I'll update if needed. I've had 5 different pencil sharpeners in my high school classroom. They were loud, and always ate up the pencil instead of getting it sharp. I have been searching for an electric pencil sharpener's and tried a couple models with no luck of anything really lasting or working that great. I think this pencil sharpener works great. It transforms a pencil into a potential murder weapon (nothing to joke about in Sunset Park, Brooklyn) in 3 seconds flat. I absolutely love this pencil sharpener. I tried leaving the pencil in long after I felt the pencil was sharp enough and it continued to sharpen endlessly.Aside from minor complaints, I would highly recommend this sharpener to anyone. I really like this pencil sharpener, it sharpens to a beautiful point, it is easy to empty, it is sturdy but not heavy, it is attractive and well made. I've had a few different pencil sharpeners in the last few years with less than positive results. They tend to be too weak to keep from stopping when the pencil is put into the sharpener.The Westcott Axis ipoint Evolution Electric Pencil Sharpener is the exception. It works great, no bogging down with a new pencil. My last pencil sharpener stopped working well after I stupidly decided it would be okay to sharpen a colored pencil. The pencil shaving reservoir  is fairly big and holds a decent volume before it needs to be emptied.M
