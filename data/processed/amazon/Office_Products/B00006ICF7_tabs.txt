It's not that bad, but it's not correct either.What I also like about the tabs is the fact that they are very sturdy so you do not have to worry about them tearing or falling out of your binder. The tabs alternate between 5 colors, though the dividers are still transparent.These are great, sturdy dividers! There are 8 multiple colored tabs. There is no cutting out and placing tabs into a slot. The colored tabs make these easier to divide by topic.The size is a standard binder size, so these dividers don't stick out from the rest of the binder and create a bulky appearance. I love these colored tabs! So I printed out the tabs I needed. These tabs are perfect for that. You could even write on the tabs themselves with a Sharpie if you wished,These dividers are really nice heavy plastic that is not going to break or tear if you drop your notebook -- very high quality and attractive.Highly recommended! The tabs are transparent so you are just reading the titles through the actual tab. Not only can you print out the Title Page for your tabs but you can also print out a Table of Contents that goes in the front of your binder behind the included protective cover.These dividers work great in any size binder.
