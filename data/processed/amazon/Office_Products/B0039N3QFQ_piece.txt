If you slide the plastic piece completely out of the track when refilling, you may have a little difficulty getting the piece back together;3. What is so difficult about tearing off a piece of tape. This is a very nicely engineered piece of gear. Also, having a piece of tape sticking up in the air on the top of your desk is asking for trouble. Each piece tugs up on the next piece so the tape is sticking up, ready to be easily grabbed with one hand.The only drawbacks are:The cost of refills exceeds the cost of a traditional roll of tape.The refills aren't as widely available as traditional rolls of "Scotch" tape. Perfect for when you need a quick piece of tape and your hands are full. It doesn't budge when pulling a piece of tape out, but it is easy to slide the whole dispenser off the desk if you need to move it someplace else. It is easy to move or remove but does not come loose when you dispense a piece of tape.Scotch brand tape is better than the cheap off brand tapes out there. Whenever I have needed a piece of tape, 2" is a fair average for the size of piece I need and this dispenser saves the aggravation of figuring out when to cut the tape. Then when you pull a piece of tape from it, voila! Only a small piece comes out at a time. Like Kleenex, that means you can simply grab a "piece of tape," which is remarkably better.

This enables you to obtain a single piece of tape just by pulling it out of dispenser with one hand.

As soon as you dispense one piece of tape, another pops up ready for use.

RIght now when you go to get a piece of tape the entire unit comes off, thus defeating the purpose of this product.I would rather have a weighted bottom/magnet bottom on the unit instead of a suction cup/tape adhesive type thing.The strips of tape were a convenient size but the lack of working bottom totally defeats the purpose of using the product.Would buy again if the dispenser bottom is fixed.
