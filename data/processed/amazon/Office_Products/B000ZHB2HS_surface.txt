The surface area is large enough that I don't have to lift my mouse each time I reach the edge like my old mouse pad did.This mouse pad is used a lot and recently I noticed a slight curl at the edge but it is not an issue for me. The surface is now made of a micro-grooved plastic which seems to move and track better. It's a slick surface and doesn't provide as good of a surface as the fabric mouse pads but for slick ones, it's pretty good.Overall, I think it's just average. While the surface feels a little like the original Precision Mousing Surface, the underlying pattern is designed to be responsive to an optical mouse. The whole surface is somehow infused with an antimicrobial protection that is supposed to inhibit the growth of bacteria. It's surface glides smoothly, and it stays pretty clean. There is enough surface area to move your hand at a 45 range. The surface has just the right amount of friction so that the mouse goes across the screen with ease and deliberate action regardless of how I have the sensitivity set. The surface of the pad has improved the mouse pointer accuracy.I really can't comment of the battery increase claim made by 3M as my mouse has had anyway great battery life.Overall, it is a recommended buy. The surface on this is SOOOO smooth that the mouse feels like it's floating across it. So the textured-looking surface is definitely something the optical beam doesn't have trouble reading.The only con I've got is that I mostly use a laptop, and I like to sit sideways on the couch and lead back, with my laptop on it's lapdesk on my lap. The surface of both the mouse pad & wrist rest are easy to wipe down and clean. The surface can be wiped clean with water.This is small enough to take with you on the road, if needed. Its surface was tested using Microsoft & Logitech mice & Energizer, Duracell & Rayovac batteries. The textured surface with its contrast print really does help my mouse perform with more accuracy. plus the surface is nice and my house moves easily on it The surface of the pad has a slight texture to it, which helps accuracy. Although thespecial mousing surface is said to offer superior performance with an optical mouse- and itcertainly does so- I found that my trusty trackball mouse worked much better as well. The surface is great, I have an apple magic mouse that is prone to getting confused and skipping around on the screen.This mousepad fixed the issue completely.However, frustration at skipping is now replaced with frustration at reaching the edge of the mousepad.

Because of its antimicrobial surface (which hinders the growth of harmful bacteria), the pad's surface appears to be cleaner and more attractive.

The surface seems to make every move more precise and responsive.

This lowers the usable surface from 8.75" x 9.25" to somewhat like 7"W x 8"H (including the gel pad of about 1.5"H).
