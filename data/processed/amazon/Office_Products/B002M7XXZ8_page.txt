They come off the page easy and do not rip paper. I now have NoteTabs stuck as page markers throughout my book, and I can get rid of all the crumpled Post-Its and other papers marking who knows what page. However, when using these to mark my current page in a textbook, I moved the tabs many many times and each time found them to be very sticky and able to be used again, no problem. You can easily see the writing on the page below the tab. Full page dividers work fine, but are inconvenient, expensive, and usually don't label well.These Note Tabs are perfect - they are durable, clear, and yet you can write on them. And they don't curl up and slip off the page--thanks to the plastic-like, fairly stiff make-up of the tabs.Consider the Avery NoteTabs an ideal compromise between writing directly on the text and covering it with loosely adhering pieces of paper. And when they're attached to a strong page, they function as dividers.Then why only four stars? It sticks to the page enough that you can grab it and open even a large cookbook by the tab and yet if you choose to move it, you can do so without damaging the page or lifting ink.

It is so handy to be able not only to mark a page, but also take a few notes about why I marked it.

You just write on the NoteTab (if desired), stick it on the page, and pull it off when you're done.

If you close the page too soon you could have ink left on the opposite page.
