The package comes with 6 rolls and each has its own dispenser. The first package I shipped I found the tape was easy to dispense from the self contained spool and the blade accurately cut the tape. It tears easily and is much stronger than other package mailing tapes I have tried. This package of 6 rolls of tape was cheaper than if I had purchased them individually in town, plus the rolls are bigger. This package consists of 6 individually labeled rolls, each of which works well. If I were using it just for the occasional package and Christmas shipping, then I would say buy one roll at a time as this would last many, many years!But for those who do a lot of personal shipping, this will be a great time saver. ** GOOD TIP ** Keep the package of six in your garage / utility room / utility closet / tool chest and put the tape back in there EACH AND EVERY TIME it is used. It's also very clear, so it can be used to tape package labels onto the package to protect them from the elements, while still being accessible by a bar code scanner. When I ordered this package I was thinking of convenience - I wouldn't have to be holding a box cutter all the time to cut the tape. I wish that they sold a refill package without the individual dispensers for cheaper, because I think it is a waste, but this ended up being the cheapest option, so I'll just deal with the waste.

One goes in the package.

I liked that this package of tape has six in a pack and that each roll comes with it's own dispenser.

It might have been better if the package had included one refillable dispenser for all the rolls.
