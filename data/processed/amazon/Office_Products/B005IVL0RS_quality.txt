The quality of prints and sharpness of photo prints is excellent.The 8 inch touch panel screen is clear, concise and easy to use and this printer also allows you to easily print from mobile devices through an addon app allowing you to print any pictures you might take on your smart phone. Epson quality is always the best. Print quality is good in BW/Color and copies are clean. I feel like they could have put more quality in this area.I'm still using the cartridges that came with it, so I'll have to update on ink useage once I get more experience with it.Bottom Line:  Its ok functionally and feel its a good machine for the value. Text quality is very good. On quality printer paper (you do get some samples courtesy of Epson) the image quality is very good and the ink is much brighter. The quality was still very good albeit perhaps a bit less sharp.Print is fast! The quality of printing was superb for an inkjet printer and I couldn't wait to try it out on a network. The Epson is much easier to operate, produces a better quality print job and has a more legible screen. The quality of prints is remarkable. Print quality is just as good as prior models but there are some great enhancements with this one:1. Printing quality is great.Highly recommended. I don't think they've designed this to be a full quality photo printer in any case - you can get a pretty decent photo but don't expect this to look as clean as if you'd printed it professionally. The quality is excellent. Even on the highest quality, there is a noticeable difference between what I get with the WorkForce 845 and the Artisan 837. It's hard to beat Epson for quality and value - especially over time. Text quality is very good. This is a fast, quality printer for a small office that wants one device to handle many tasks at a moderate price. Printing quality 4 Star. Print quality for office documents is good. The quality of scanned documents is good.I can't speak to the fax machine because I don't use it.In summary, this is a fine all-in-one for medium-duty office work or home use, with good networking capability, high ease-of-use, and good performance.ASIDE: Last year, I started using anEpson WorkForce 630 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer, Copier, Scanner, Fax (C11CB07201)in one of my offices and was very happy with its performance and usability. )The quality of the output is great, as well. No, it's still not the quality of a good laser printer but for most purposes it's more than adequate.

I used the Epson branded 4 X 6 Premium Glossy Photo Paper and the Pictures came out really fast and in great quality!

Very high quality - or, if you choose, very fast.

Drop the quality down, and you'll save on ink AND it'll print FAST.Oh, and this can fax, too (if anyone still does that.)
