I can;t believe they didn't think of this a  long time ago! Maybe with time you can figure out a way to get clean tears, but it isn't simple. The next time you are on Amazon, please order a pack. I use them all the time. I will have to spend more time with the new Post-it labels to see if their greater stickiness presents any problems when used for the same casual purposes as the original Post-it notes.I have used the word "easily" a lot in this review, and this is what this product is all about. So I'm an IT Administrator and I can't tell you how many time I see people write their passwords on a post it note and stick it to their computer monitor... Do you remember the time before we had "sticky notes" or "post-its"? Why didn't they come out with these a long time ago? A long time ago, I met someone who worked as a summer intern for 3-M. In the mean time, it can be removed very cleanly just like regular post-it notes. I bet this time he'll notice the "Not at this address!" Every time I tried to remove the perforated edge, I ripped the post-it.I had better luck peeling the label off the pad, then tearing the perforated edge, then sticking the sticker on the box - but you've got to be kidding me.The idea is nice, but the end result is just not neat. Most of the time it's just notes like, "Cooked breakfast for you; look in fridge," or "let the dogs out in the run before you go. Most of the time, with other post-it notes, they would fall off.
