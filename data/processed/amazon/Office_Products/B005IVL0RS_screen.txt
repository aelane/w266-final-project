This screen also displays photos from your memory card & lets you select them for printing.7. A large, easy to read touch screen (one of the big differences between the 635 and the 845) controls everything from faxing to copying, printing to setup. The touch screen may draw many people to this printer instead of the 645, but if you don't care about having touch screen and also dual tray capacity, you very well may suffice just fine with the 645.You can't go wrong with either choice as both are excellent printers. Touch screen control with tilt out is very responsive and easy to navigate3. Very cool.The screen is small but easy to read since they used a good color contrast for the menus.Printing is a breeze. That's how I like my user-interface.The screen tilts, which is great for me because I have it on the floor. Menu on screen is common sense, easy to understand by anyone without reading a manual. The touch screen display is intuitive and easy to use, and overall functionality has been exactly what I've come to expect from Epson. It also has a very easy to use touch screen panel.One of the things we like the most about the Epson 630 is how long lasting the ink cartridges are.

One is the touch screen on the printer; the other is from your computer.

The large screen is very nice as well, and I can say from my previous printer that Epson seems reliable.So, why not five star?

I found the touch screen somewhat difficult to use, even though I have small fingers it was easy to fat finger the numbers, especially since the touch screen is not particularly responsive.
