The pen also has a similar plastic bottle look. It's just an all around cool pen. At (as of 3.23.11) $1.80 per pen, it's a bit expensive, but I'd buy them just to encourage other companies to start producing their products from recycled waste. This pen may just be my new favourite. Although, refilling a pen may not be as easy as just reaching for another disposable, under normal circumstances it's not that much more effort to unscrew the barrel and pop in a refill if they are located next to the new pens in the stationery cabinet.My main criticism of the pen would be:- G-2 refills are not as affordable in the US as in the UK or Asia where it is more common to refill a pen rather than buy a new one for practical, environmental and economical reasons.- Smooth barrel may be inconvenient for those who need a more tactile grip.Whether Pilot is "green washing" or if a recycled pen barrel is more "green" overall in terms of energy and cost in recycling the original water bottle is another debate for another forum. I love a retractable pen and my pilot pens seem to conveniently "walk away". It writes as well as any gel pen I've used and it's made from recycled water bottles. The pen is even styled to look kind of like a water bottle - which has turned out to be my only complaint.Although the pen works great, the 'water bottle' grip isn't that comfortable for me. Great pen from Pilot brand. I LOVE this pen. I think the pen's aesthetics are somewhat marred by the green&white; label halfway up the barrel, but this can be easily removed (and the Pilot logo is embossed in the plastic underneath it.) Considering that the pen is refillable, I wonder why they come in a box of 12. I put the pen through its paces. The pen is well balanced (for plastic) and the barrel is a comfortable size. I was happy to keep that as my go-to pen, but this B2P pen is so good that I've been using it almost exclusively for the past week. Other than that, I love to use this pen and have even recommended it to my friends.Natalie S. for Amazon Vine I like how the pen writes - very fluid and smooth. The pen is a little thicker than normal and felt better in my hand. So, I'll look at this pen from various angles: comfort, ink quality, longevity, and nib sizing.When writing and taking notes, I prefer pens with grips close to the nib (or no grip at all) and that's the first thing I noticed about this pen. However, the pen is very lightweight. It wasn't very long ago that this pen would have been classified as a medium ballpoint (and in my mind, it still is based on the line it produces). This pen is 0.7mm; it's best to get this pen for the comfort, but grab the 0.5mm or 0.38mm refills.Since times are changing, it's best to rely on the actual nib sizing rather than the textual equivalent offered. *This pen is not recommended for signing checks or other legal documents because it is not water fast.
