I wouldn't personally purchase this after seeing how drab the colors are. The colors are bright and stick well-as I would expect from Scotch brand. I love the colors and it fits on a standard tape roll. The colors are really pretty and vibrant. Other colors are available. The colors are very pretty. Scotch Expressions Magic Tape is juiced up with bright modern colors and designs. I love the nice bold colors of the tape. The colors in this tribal pack are bright and fun, but the best part is how the tape functions. I like that all of the different colors go together. Beautiful colors and is great for making cards or other crafts. The colors are really nice, though. The colors in this package are a pretty Spring Green, turquoise blue and tribal colors of turquoise, Spring green, yellow, purple, orange and white. The colors are bright and bold but the tape is still slightly transparent. Be sure to plan your colors ahead of time. The two solid colors coordinate really well with the designed tape.It's nice for whenever you want to add a stripe of color (or design) to something, like a photo, notebook, or package. I like that it comes in so many different colors and patterns. It's actually still quite transparent despite the colors and design, so you can't cover unsightly text/markings with the tape and expect it to be unnoticeable.
