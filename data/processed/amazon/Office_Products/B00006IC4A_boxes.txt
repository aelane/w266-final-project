Folding these recycled "medium-duty" boxes into shape didn't impress me. They didn't seem better than the standard boxes, but they cost a lot more unless you pick up a 12-pack from Amazon (currently $36, or $3/each). The boxes are made of heavy cardboard construction and will clearly last a long time and hold up over time. I use these boxes to store my tax receipts and paperwork each year.They are easy and intuitive to fold, and are made out of 100% recycled materials.They can store traditional letter-size manilla folders, or turned to a landscape orientation, can store legal-sized folders.A get a year's worth of receipts into each box, so the size is adequate. I would recommend these boxes for all but the heaviest of applications. I like these boxes because:- They are 100% recycled- Price is not bad- They stack nicely in the attic Putting the boxes together is almost an instantaneous process that is quite easy, and it is very good to hear that these boxes are a 100% recycled which adds a good feeling of having the boxes around. And these boxes are no exception. You could use these boxes for files, but I mainly use them for other assorted items and they're great. The boxes are sturdy, easy to put together and best of all made from 100% recycled products. These were slightly less deep than some of my oldest boxes and frankly I don't mind that since some of those boxes actually sag in the middle when picked up repeatedly. The boxes arrived within a big box, within another big box. Kind of felt guilty for receiving two extra boxes that weren't necessary; I recycled them. The boxes folded out beautifully and didn't need any folding. These boxes are sturdy enough to hold either and stack up well. We usually buy the cheaper boxes which have to be folded in a rather complicated manner, but the sides have started to break down and cause problems with the stacks falling over spilling papers out of the top.
