I'm happy to have these letter-sized hanging file folders because I'm transferring all my files from a big heavy lateral file cabinet to two or three portable file boxes that I will stow on a shelf. Like my old Smead hanging folders, these fixed tab folders can be expanded by folding on the creased lines at the bottom. If you think that there is not much to say about a hanging file folder, you would be correct. Now my hanging files are so attractive I will want to keep them organized and up to date thanks to these convenient and attractive files from Amazon!Smead Hanging FasTab Folder, Letter, 1/3 Cut Tab, Assorted Colors, 18 per Box (64053) These should last much longer than the typical hanging folder. The hanging files themselves are this dark ugly green. I needed more letter-sized hanging folders for my personal/home file cabinet and decided to try these. The traditional hanging folder tends to get torn up by the plastic insert and who can find inserts when they need them? So if most of your hanging files are just a few pages of paper, these will waste space and will not be a good choice.But I would bet most people who use hanging files have them quite packed. I took out my old hanging folders (the ones with the tabs that you have to connect to the file) and replaced them with these new ones. I like these much better than my old hanging folders. Overall, an excellent hanging folder. These are as good as any other hanging file folders. I always tab my hanging files, even if a tabbed file folder is inside, so I know where to put it back later -- so these do save me time in that regard. Smead FasTab (64201) hanging folders are nice heavy duty hanging files with 2" expansion bottoms. These FasTab hanging folders are great. When my hanging files fail, it's because the hangers rip through the folder board wrapped around them.
