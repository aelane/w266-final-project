I have an HP 3600N but needed a printer in another location that I could also print to from my iPhone. It's a solid printer that does a great job. I have to reboot the printer repeatedly to get one piece of paper to print.I will try tech support one more time on Monday. I don't think it is the printer, it seems as if it is in the software that I downloaded.VERY VERY frustrated and disappointed in this entire purchase...EDITED: After three, yes three hours on the phone with HP Support, it is working...for now. This printer is great. Other than that it's a great printer and produces quality printed material every time, including color photos. I bought this printer after researching various color laser printers because I like the Hewlett Packard brand (have had no trouble with HP computers, scanners or printers for 20 years now). Because this printer is wireless, it can be used by others on my network. This printer is pretty big, and weighs over 40 pounds, so it has to be put on a very sturdy base. But otherwise it's a fantastic printer.

I'd buy this printer again.

It tells me to "check the printer for errors".

So, I sit here with a printer that does not work.
