It is much faster than the portable label printers I have used in the past.- Easy to open and replace cartridges, or to clean the print heads.- Labels are easy to use once they are printed. It's quick to simply type in the label you want and then print it off. If you have want a more portable label maker, then you'll want to choose a handheld model.All in all, it's a great label maker--just pull out the tape a little the first time! I was printing off my first label in under 2 minutes! I've owned a few different label makers, including an old style manual Dymo, a handheld Brother, and a USB Brother model. * Dymo Labelmanager PnP label maker, model 1768960* Li-Ion Battery (ships partially charged)* On-Board software (Dymo Label Light)* USB cable* Starter cassette of " D1 labels. Dymo label Light should launch when you start up the device in Windows. I have a Brother which advances the label to allow you to cut it and I use up a good deal of label stock that way. The label printer plugs straight into a computer and is ready to go. Printed the label and that sold me! This label printer is very good at the one thing it does, making labels, and doesn't do anything else. This label maker has a small footprint and works off USB power, so I can keep it in my laptop case and use it only when I need it. A very good label maker that connects up to a PC at a very good price. and snapping in the supplied label tape cart. I was impressed how easy it was to print out the first label. Instead this label's surface is shiny and it feels a bit tougher than the older hand held labels I'm used to. The blank label refills are a bit more pricey, but not by much and given the way they look when applied, I could deal with that. If you turn off or unplug the label maker, it acts just as if you had unplugged a USB external drive. The label size is a limiting factor - it only takes up to 1/2 inch tape. This is a good label maker if you are just labeling drawers or bins or something like that. This label maker comes with a 10-foot starter black-and-white tape cassette that prints black characters on a white tape. There are several other label cassette options, such as blue characters on a white tape, and black characters on a red tape. I've used other label makers - some handheld, some that require a computer. This is one of the best label makers I've used!It's SUPER easy to use - just insert the small battery included, plug it into a USB port in a computer, and start printing. Maybe you will---if so, buy a bigger label printer. I've got several label makers. In short, this DYMO label maker is a USB device that can be powered by your computer (bus-powered), and when you plug it in, it appears as an external drive in Explorer. I've owned several Brother PC-based label printers. My Brother label printers printed high-quality text, but the D1's print quality seems low-quality. You have a label. And Amazon carries the D1 label stock so it's easy to replenish.I find this much easier to use than the label markers with the built in keyboards. Being able to create the label via software instead of keying it in on a hand held label maker is a nice improvement in ease of use and is a time saver as well. I typed a label and click print and then the device hums to life but no label appeared. The DYMO LabelManager Plug 'n' Play Label Maker is a sweet little label printer that you can take almost anywhere. This label didn't even survive a sink washing.The concept is there, but I cannot recommend this for anything more than putting labels on file folders.The unit itself is very small - about the size of a hard drive. What you have heer is a very basic label printer that stays right on your desk next to the computer, for use on everyday p;ain labeling jobs. Buuut, the label glue is weak and comes unstuck mighty fast if on a slick surface that gets any rubbing etc. Plus it's a one-line label only, so it's not very good for addresses.If you only use this basic label maker for folders and files, it will do the trick well and is crazy easy to get started. I've tested many label makers over the years. I was enthusiastically impressed with the Dymo Plug n Play label maker - it was a sheer joy to use.This isn't a hand held label maker. Some label makers are great for labeling manila folders, wires, your toolbox, and anything else that you plan on keeping for a long time. Some label makers can print graphics and have many options for boxes. Many label makers can make bar codes, which seem to be ubiquitous in offices, factories and even homes.Electronic label makers have come along since the first label makers were produced. After all, this label maker plugs into a computer and has a neat screen for setting up your label. Suddenly, a label maker that sits on my desk is not such a good idea any more. This label will not print out cable flags, which the Epson LW-400 will do. This label maker will handle tape up to a half inch, which is useful for many things, but it would have been nice to have the option for three quarter inch.This label maker does some things really well. I have a Brother P-Touch label maker and have yet to see anyone complain about a defective P-Touch cartridge, and Brother has sold millions of those cartridges. Personally, this label maker is not my favorite. They are however, not inexpensive.To save on label waste, I like that the unit does not auto cut the label. If I were buying my first and only label maker, I would buy this if the project allowed me to sit in one place, making lots of labels quickly. The label itself comes out nice and clear and is waterproof. As I have come to expect from Dymo the label quality is top notch and easy to peel of the backing. I was able to print my first label in less than a minute. Definitely recommend this to those needing a simple label maker; maybe in an office setting where you want to label a lot of files and need something quick and easy.The only downside I found was the ink provided in the box doesn't seem like a lot, and I find the replacement ink to be a bit pricey (more than $10). I have two label makers both of the battery powered hand-held type and the Labelmanager is a giant step beyond those in many ways.The Labelmanager utilizes the computer keyboard for creating text on a label, making it unnecessary to peck around among those quirky buttons on a hand-held label maker.The Dymo Labelmanager runs on a Lithium -ion battery that recharges through an ordinary USB power port on a computer eliminating the need to continue replacing throw away batteries.The Labelmanager is well designed and small enough to place beside a computer when in use.The label tapes are standard Dymo D1 cartridges available in most office supply stores. I believe it tops any and maybe all of the hand-held label makers on the market today. Trying to do a new label took longer than it should have. Once you connect this label make to powered USB port, after assembling the label maker by inserting battery and label cartridge, it shows up as a USB drive on your computer. The label make comes with 1/2 in label cartridge - the widest size, which is barely wide enough to print 1 line labels. So this label maker will not work for multi line labels.BOTOMLINE: In short term use, this label maker works very well for labels up to 1/2 in width, how it holds in long term is something I do not know yet. If you want a label really quick it and your computer is not on you have to wait for it to boot up before you can use the label maker. This is a good label maker for small office applications. This label maker takes advantage of that ability.Good:Really easy to set up. I know that general label makers (my Brother machine) do make flags that work, although they are sometimes hard to get lined up.You CANNOT use the  or  1 inch tape in this machine which is not all that clear from the description.
