I ordered this printer back in January, and just installed it in May as I was still trying to use up the ink in my older printer, an HP F380, which has lasted for 9 years and really still works. This printer is fully wireless and extremely easy to set up. I will stick with my Epsons.This is an economical printer and scanner that should please most people. The HP ENVY 4500 is my first printer upgrade since approximately 2005. I desperately wanted a printer with wireless connectivity since we have 3 laptops, 2 desktops and 2 smart phones. Maybe I'm just accustomed to my other printer, but that is something that would have been useful to note in words on the instructions.Also, my printer printed the calibration page as indicated in step 6 of the setup, but did not offer the scanning portion of the calibration page. I am happy that this printer does automatic duplex (double sided) printing. Now I can email to my printer from anywhere and have it print documents. The HP Envy 4500 Wireless printer works perfectly with my IPad and IPhone. Just what I would expect in a printer from HP. I absolutely LOVE this HP Envy Wireless printer. Once printer was installed on wi-fi it is easily detected by every computer (both Windows & Mac), iPhone and iPad alike. Can be well supported in the printer foot print itself.Ink Usage: Can't comment yet as i have not done excessive printing at home.ePrint option: superb feature where you can setup an email address for the printer from HP ePrint Center and can print from anywhere if you send an email to this address. The printer will print the email and the attachments.Value for Money: A bit on the higher side, would be an amazing deal at about seventy bucks. This printer is super sleek, and set up was a breeze. It had fax, and this doesn't, but aside from that, I prefer this printer's look. Other printer manufacturers should be envious of this printer. The printer can be connected to a PC via USB cable also (not supplied).I find it difficult to find any big negatives. I found the printer to be easy to set up and it appears to work very well. This is my first wireless printer and I feel so clever when I print from my laptop on the porch or from my iPhone. He finds his printer to be noisy.
