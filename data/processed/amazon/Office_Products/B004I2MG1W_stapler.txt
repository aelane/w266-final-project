I've used a stapler for stapling thick stacks of paper before - a heavy duty thing with extra large and heavy staples. This stapler takes a different approach to the job, it uses fairy light, wire staple, with extra long tines, and it uses the leverage of the lengthened handle to drive the sharp staples through the paper. (My old heavy-duty stapler was silver and looked too tool-ish.) This stapler is HUGE. This is a great stapler for use in our home office. So for us, this stapler is a great thing to have- it easily staples through MANY pages without any wrist or hand strain or "errant" staples that don't quite do the job. I really like this stapler because it does what it's designed to do: secures important papers and documents and keeps them together in a professional manner. It's fun showing them how to maneuver this very large stapler into "firing" position to staple different textures together; from construction paper to cardboard and foils, my Stanly handles it all with safety and ease.The only thing that bothers me--since I'm fussy about aesthetics--is thatStanley Bostitch EZ Squeeze 130 Flat Clinch Reduced Effort Stapler (B8130)spoils the looks of my desk. :-)Highly recommended for those who need a more heavy-duty stapler; for routine, smaller jobs, a regular stapler should do nicely.Reviewed by Betty Dravis, September 21, 2011Author of "Dream Reachers" book series (with Chase Von) That's pretty normal but I'd been using an ergonomic stapler for awhile now that loads differently so if you don't get the button in back, just realize it's old school stapler style. I dont think you can use this as a tacking stapler either.Not a bad product, time will tell in an office situation if it holds up well, but if it does, you can definately staple some thick documents. This is a serious stapler. This LOOKS like a high powered stapler, but I haven't used it yet, because:1) There were no staples included with it, although there were supposed to be!2) There were also no INSTRUCTIONS included, and this is not a simple stapler with obvious loading and use instructions!Thus I am giving it only 3 stars, and must assume that since it came with no instructions and no staples, its performance may also be flawed.Furthermore, it took a fair amount of time to even FIND the required staples, on Amazon and elsewhere.I have e-mailed Bostitch with a request for the instructions, and if and when I hear from the company, I will update this review. it is far easier to use than any other large stapler I am experienced with. This stapler will be donated to the school class room where I work and will be receiving almost constant daily use. I was surprised at how quiet the stapler is, perfect for office/school use.The stapler is quite large and, unfortunately, does not have a lock mode. Also, this stapler is not able to open up to allow you to staple against other surfaces (e.g. This stapler handles the task with ease. This Stanley Bostitch stapler certainly fits the bill.To write this review, I took a large stack of papers and stapled it using different staplers -- the Swingline 390, the Office Depot Heavy Duty Stapler (Item #504210), and this Bostitch EZ Squeeze 130 stapler.The Swingline 390 performed relatively poor in comparison to the other two. This is not your typical desk-top stapler. Even though the stapler is BIG and bulky, it is super easy to use, and makes a nice neat staple regardless of paper thickness. I so needed a stapler of this caliber and magnitude! I can honestly say that this stapler has made filing things away in my home easier especially when I'm couponing and need to staple stacks of circulars to file them away. The Stanley Bostitch EZSqueeze stapler is without a doubt a professional industrial grade stapler. Overall I found the stapler to be easy and comfortable to use. I have had to clear out the stapler on several occasions because of it jamming. I wish that I had this stapler when I was putting together proposals at my old job. This is not a stapler for the light of heart; it's intimidating! If you are simply looking for a good stapler that doesn't take up too much room on your desk, look elsewhere unless you like impressing your co-workers! This is a very well made, sturdy stapler that looks as rugged as it feels. This stapler is huge! The EZ Squeeze stapler solves that problem quite nicely. When possible, I like them stapled, but I had given up on a stapler that could get the job done.I
