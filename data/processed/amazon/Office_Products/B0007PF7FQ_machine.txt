I purchase this machine about a month ago. Physically this is a nice, compact machine that fits well on a small desk. Overall, this is an excellent, flexible machine that is also an excellent value. This machine has the lowest price that I've found for a machine with so many features, is simple to set up, is reliable and has never needed any repairs.2. The machine can be programmed to automatically reset its internal clock in the Spring and Fall for daylight savings time. If you depend upon this machine, or any other multi-function machine, for all of its capabilities you'll lose them all when it needs repair or replacement.In summary, the Brother MFC-7820N takes up less space and costs less than buying a separate printer, scanner, FAX machine and copier. Also, I don't believe this machine is any nosier than any other printer out there. This machine, is much more basic looking (read slick looking) that my older machine, and holds 250 sheets inside the printer. All and all, this machine has met all my expectations for a home-office printer.

When my old, expensive FAX machine failed in 2005 I was forced to look for a replacement.

This machine also performs well as a digital 20 ppm auto-feed photocopy machine.

The machine's automatic document feeder, which holds about 35 pages, also works with its scanner, enabling anyone on the network to scan multiple page documents into any application that supports scanning.
