Good simple paper at a great price. As paper goes, this paper works as advertised. Hopefully, this is where I will buy all my paper in the future. This paper is high quality and it was a real bargain. The paper was just what I needed and fits my bill just great. At first I wondered if the paper had survived but it was OK. All five of the ream's packages were torn or had the seals busted. Even with this the paper inside was OK and I noted no damage upon checking each ream's sheets. This paper has worked fine in all 3 and I have had no problems with ink smudges, etc. I do recommend this paper. this paper is actually better than i thought it would be. Great paper, no complaints. I was pleasantly surprised when I began loading this paper into my printer! I have not had any paper jams occur. It is extremely close to the copying paper I used to use at work for so many years! Although this paper is not even partially recycled Georgia-Pacific is working with the sustainable forestry initiative. The paper is good quality paper. Excellent paper quality and exactly what I needed. This paper was a little heavier in weight than would be ideal, as it's a bit hard on the HP laser jet printer  It's a good price, but this is not a ream of paper, so value wasn't exactly the best. We go through more paper at my office than I care to mention, even though we are 'paperless.' This paper is bright, inexpensive, and does not jam the printer or the copier.Best of all, it beats other retailers because this is delivered right to our door vs. going to big-box store where you have to lug it in and out. Good paper at a good price. Between them they print out enough paper that I have to order toner every six months. Great paper, great price, never jams. The paper is - well  - paper. And are forever short on paper. The paper is stronmg and copies very well. I bought this paper for "every day printing"  I think about50 percent of everything we print ends up getting tossed away.If you need photo printing quality paper, or paper for animportant project... pick another product.I am a real estatesales agent and sometimes print out dozens of listings forclients... it is great for that as well
