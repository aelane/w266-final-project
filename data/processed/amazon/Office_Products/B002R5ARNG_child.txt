If only one child, think re-sale at HS book fair ! This is supposed to lead the child along the path to creative exposition in later grades. I would recommend this for any child who is learning to write and enjoys using their imaginations to write. This is great if you have a child who reads and writes well already. Any child, whether they read or not, could think of a few words that go with the prompt, but I think it's unrealistic to say that this book is geared to kindergarten children. The child then has to complete a short paragraph on the topic.I really like the logical, progressive layout as described above for the MEAD EARLY LEARNING IDEA BUILDERS STAGE THREE WORKBOOK. The child is then asked to write six farm animals in the lines below. They will work well for any child; but it takes a special book to work with a special needs child as well. She then has the child write vocabulary linked to particular subjects; I.e. Your child must think of three words that describe snow, write them down, and then write a sentence using those three words. Obviously you will need to sit down with your child and help them go through it, but this book provides structure which makes it much easier for him/her to learn.Recommended.
