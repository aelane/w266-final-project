We are very happy with these binders. All of the 6 binders in this box are white and each binder has pockets in the front and back. These binders are sturdy, and have a fold-out front cover that makes them less likely to break there. I had 6 binders DONE in less than 3 minutes! I have many, many binders in my home. I usually buy D-ring binders but these are round ring. I was excited to get these binders and try them out. You can find similar binders for between $3 and $5 each.#2 The design. I used the binders of other brands with tight plastic, but in those cases I would just cut the inserts a smaller width. That is what I bought before I realized the even ring binders have levels of quality. These binders are first quality. I like these binders and the price is less than one might expect to pay for a lesser quality binder. I don't know what to say about these binders other than they are quality binders, like you can find at one of the chain office supply stores... These binders are fantastic -- especially durable and resistant to getting dirty, even though they are white. They are sturdy and durable.These binders are made in the U.S.A. When you first look at these binders you feel that they really are not what you thought they would be. These binders are easy to label both front, back and side with the easy to slip in pockets, the spine and rings seem to be of good quality, I won't know for sure until school starts. I like the binders otherwise and will use them. These binders seem to be very well constructed with all the standard expectations like the spring loaded rings and the extra room on the front cover to prevent the paper from ripping. With these binders you can very quickly put a spine label in because there is about a 1/8 inch gap at the top of the pocket. Overall these binders are of average or slightly above average quality. I use about 30 1-inch binders each year. Like most binders, the pockets inside are limited in capacity, but the placement of the ring on the rear instead of the spine greatly reduces the occurrence of ripped pages compared to spine-mounted versions. These are great binders for any use, as long as you don't try to overfill them. If so, you'll find these channeled-spine binders are definitely going to make your job easier, as it is effortless to load even a light weight paper into the narrow sleeve slot.Before I actually had one of these binders in hand, I didn't quite understand what was meant by a channeled spine. So, if you plan on saving the binders for another job, insert something like a transparency sheet between your printed insert and the clear plastic. I am guilty of over-stuffing binders, and the way these are designed that is pretty hard to do. Overall, these are very decent binders. As for the actual binders, they look like many others with black bolts on the rear cover holding the ring bar. These binders are guaranteed for life but I haven't investigated the return policy for faulty binders. These binders are fine, better than many but not by much. I have found these binders to be very sturdy. I received these binders to review for the Amazon Vine Program. I have found that these binders are great for organizing my user manuals for around the house. Although I view binders as expendable products, it is nice to know that if one fails prematurely - the company will stand behind their product. I didn't want to carry the large binders, so these were just the right size. These durable binders are easy to load and look good. When these binders are on the shelf, there are a few wrinkles on the spine that hit the light and it doesn't look as neat as it could. With these binders, SRSLY... You just drop the appropriately sized piece of paper in there and PRESTO! And I am compulsive about the binders I use. I wanted binders that would last a while and allow for repeated use and display. If, like me, you use binders very frequently, you're probably familiar with the difficulty of inserting labels into the spine sections of view binders. These Samsill binders somehow make that chore a snap. These are very sturdy binders that I used to organize printouts of several online classes. After receiving these binders, I must say I was a little less than thrilled after seeing the price tag. Yes, they are more sturdy than binders you can find at Staples or Walmart, but... These are very expensive for binders, so they are either dramatically over-priced or marketed toward a demographic which can take advantage of their stronger points.The big selling point is the spine and how quickly you can put a label in it. When I received these binders, I thought to myself, "Isn't a binder just a binder? Well... these binders are very nice. I use MANY binders for sheet music, vocal scores and the like. However, I really believe you get what you pay for and I'll be using all 6 of my binders for large music projects because they are, indeed the best binders I own! Here's the good:  These are sturdy binders with minimal flexing. Some of my other binders cause the contents to hang askew, which risks damaging the bound contents. Other binders I own have a hole punched in the plastic cover over that bolt; over time I've noticed that hole can catch on things and tear. I have bought less expensive binders that were made of better material. I have the one-inch binders and those are perfect to fit in on shelves without over filling. These are nice basic binders The binders are pretty standard 1" binders--the covers and the D-ring work fine. With the usual binders running $3 - $12 depending on the brand and size, it got to be pretty expensive when there were seven classes asking for them.The Samsill binders come in a six pack (though my box had an extra in it, so I ended up with a pack of seven)and cost $37. Plus, these binders got put to the test and even after banging them around, putting a lot of force on the spine, and overstuffing them, they've held up so far. I am setting up Math / Writing binders for my 5th grade students, and I wanted something of real quality.
