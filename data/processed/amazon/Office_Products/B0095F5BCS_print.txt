", you can still usually get excellent print results without calibration by using Canon inks and Canon papers with this printer. If you mainly just change some common print options using the standard Microsoft Windows printer pop-up windows, the large number of options available in this "Print Studio Pro" plug-in may be a bit bewildering. The print plug studio software is OK, not great but OK - but printing from other photo software is easy.The printer itself is HUGE, and I mean huge - it also weighs almost 50 pounds so think about that before you buy.All the usual bells and whistles, wi-fi, mobile printing, High speed USB etc. Feature-rich with fine detailed print reproduction from digital images, the Canon PIXMA Pro 100 is as promised.I recommend it! I compared my 13X19 print to an 8X10 print that I got from Shutterfly and the color fidelity of the Canon Pro-100 is obviously significantly better - exact same file. The print quality is excellent and is aided by logic to get it right. If you like to print, examine, tweak, print, edit, print and frame however... then this printer is for you, it's *TOTALLY* worth the price. The print quality is amazing on this. )Secondly, the print quality. Since the print head moves fast, It might be nice to be big and heavy if I have a enough space actually though.Overall, this is a quality printer that offers 13" wide printing capability. The overall print quality is outstanding. If your print head dies (the thing that the cartridges sit in and contains the spray heads) in a Canon, you order a new one and pop it in and you're on your way. BTW, JPEGs are 8-bit, so if you use the XPS print driver you need to print from your photo editor while still in 16 bit mode. Here's how you get around that: in the print driver, select A3 13x19 Matte Paper regardless of what fine art rag you use. On an average 8 x 10 print I would say the speed differs very little from the Epson, HP and Canon printers on my desktop.INK ECONOMY:  Canon is the only company I have seen who publishes a realistic guide to real-life ink usage (available at the PRO-100 support site online). Installing the print head and cartridges just takes time - you can't get around it.Installing the software is pretty easy -- just keep hitting next mostly.Another thing to note is that, like the Pro 1, this printer is HEAVY. I was blown away by the print quality.
