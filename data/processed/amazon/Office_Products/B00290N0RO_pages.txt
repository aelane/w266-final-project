I wouldn't use it forWhat I like:-perforated pages; easy to tear pages-pockets to store pages-paper is acid-free, lingin-free, and fade-resistant-good size paper (14x11); I prefer this size better than the8-1/2 x 11 version (54404)or smallerWhat I don't like:-wire-bound allows for paper to move, and therefore smudge sketches (especially when using charcoal). She says she loves the huge pages because of the freedom the big canvas gives her when she's doing drawings. The pages are nice and big, the paper is a good thickness, and it's just the right texture. The pages are nice and big, 14 x 11 inches. I've even run the pages through my computer to print out art prints. The pages have a good thickness and are perforated perfectly to tear from the book. The pages also tear out nicely if you want to remove them--its perforated. The pages are a bit over sizes so that leave room for great creations! Spiral holds pages well and they are perforated and detach easily without need for pre-creasing. * The pages are thick, so you won't damage anything when you erase, yet they're (just barely) thin enough that you can trace something, provided it's backlit, such as with a light box. * It's spiral-bound, so you can flip through the pages as often as you like, without worrying about the glue loosening. * Best of all, the pages are perforated along one side, so if you want to remove a sketch for scanning, it will tear out cleanly. The pages are thick enough so that markers don't bleed through the the back of the page. I will update if the pages flunk this test, within this month. The pages rip out easily and cleanly with care. Nice, smooth pages for pencil and pen sketches.
