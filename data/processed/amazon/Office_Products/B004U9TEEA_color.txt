The color range is nice too. Tried a different color, that skipped too. These are nice color pans from Paper Mate, a trusted pen manufacturer.The pens come in 8 different colors, or course the blue and black ones will get the most use in my household.But it's nice to have the other colors as well.I find these to write nice and smoothly, a very nice product IMO. Given the color variety of the pack, the price on these seems worthwhile. If you're looking for some great color pens to add on, I recommend these. I loved the color selection in this set of pens. I really like the color vibrancy of each pen; you can actually use all of them without worrying about the ink not showing up. LOVE these pens.The color of the ink is vibrant.They write very smoothly.The clear plastic bodies make for a nice appearance, jewel-like.And best of all - much cheaper than the Uniball and Pilot brands equivalents that I usually purchase. Love the color choices and the rubber grip. I like the color choices in the InkJoy pens by Papermate, and the idea of the smooth writing sounded great. The color is pretty vivid, and they write well. The color of the ink is readily evident by the color of the pen's barrel and finger grip, a grip that is cushiony comfortable and lightly perforated to keep one's fingers from slipping.The medium point works well for most applications. I still like to write and it is fun to be able to choose your color. I was almost disappointed that it didn't include yellow, but that color wouldn't be very useful in a regular ink pen. I use color to keep my various tasks straight.
