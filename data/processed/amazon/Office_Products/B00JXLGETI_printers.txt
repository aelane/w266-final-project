Having used Epson printers for over a decade, the Epson WorkForce WF-7610 printer is my first all-in-one wide format printer and I was amazed by the size of this printer but also how convenient this printer is for any professional business.With the wide-format, there are a number of things that make this printer so much more appealing than any previous WorkForce which I have used.For one, because of its wide format, I now have a scanner that is the size of my previous desktop Epson scanners. I have gradually been replacing our printers with Epson finding the quality of the prints much higher, and to my surprise, the cost lower! Other than that, the printers are identical. I've had a few printers suffer scanning damage during shipment. Both my other printers are more expensive than this and much more limited. I needed to get two printers to replace two that I had that were not functional enough for my needs. I can say that these two printers are quite amazing in my opinion. These Epson printers have been known to be a little tricky to get installed, and in the past I have fought with some of them to get them working properly on the wireless network. Both printers are heavy and large, which is not unexpected given their capabilities. Both printers have still larger footprints when set up for printing with their paper catching platforms extended. I'll also be honest and admit that I will predominately use my B&W; Laser printers for 90% of my use.
