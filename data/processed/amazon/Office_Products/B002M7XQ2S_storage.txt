And there is a Lifetime Warranty.The storage rack that comes in the packaging is meant to be used "inside the box" they come in. The storage rack? It does say that it comes with a storage rack but it's really just two pieces of plastic with spaces for the scissors to stand upright with spots that can pop together. The touted "storage rack" is a variation of the molded clear plastic that holds many small items for display in stores; a soup-can plastic tub will work better, but this is minor and doesn't detract at all from the scissors. The "storage rack" is cheap packaging material, but it hasn't worn out yet. )The storage case isn't any good for storing, so I keep the scissors in a plastic pencil box purchased for under a buck during back-to-school.Great scissors, and at this price, they are easy to send a couple of pairs to school, and keep the rest at home. It comes in a storage rack so children can place them back so everything stays organized! The "storage rack" is pretty cheap and not very durable; it keeps falling down, too. I just threw the storage rack away because it's better to just put them in a pencil cup or storage box. First, there's no storage rack inside this package. They look nice and come with a storage rack.The scissors are easy and comfortable for children to use. The storage rack is made of thin plastic but is working fine so far.These are great for children to use and easy for the adults supervising them to use as well.
