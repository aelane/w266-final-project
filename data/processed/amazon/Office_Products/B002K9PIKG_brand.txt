3M and their Avery brand are really pushing to take a piece of the label pie from Avery and they seem to be doing a great job. I like this brand over some other brands simply because there isn't a strip around the edge and center. This makes it so easy to use with Microsoft Word.Another plus for the 3M brand is that the labels are on the page but there is no sticker "border" around each label. They're just as good as the Avery brand, which presently dominates the market. 3M is the brand of choice when purchasing labels of any kind. These are as good as any other brand you may have used in the past. The Avery brand exposes more of the edge compared to 3M, making it easier to peel the label off. However, the 3M brand allows us to expose either the right or lefthand side of the labels. Some of the more off brand products I have purchased in the past have nothing written on the labels, on the sheets themselves, including the avery template number, 3M template number and an arrow as to which side to feed the paper in first.When I am in the market again for these, 3M will be on the list of possibilities and probably be cheaper than some of the competitors as well. I now buy the 3M brand when I need any type of printer label.

I have never used 3M brand labels shipping before and found them well made, easy to use and had no paper jamming issues at all.

As with the other 3M brand labels I've used in the past, these are a great quality and used with a laser printer, I had no issues with smudging.
