Dry erase markers come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors - not to mention quality. My dry erase board has a narrow ledge on the bottom edge to put markers but unfortunately the ledge doesn't have much of a "lip" on it so my other dry erase markers were always rolling off and falling into my dog's water fountain. We use dry erase markers often in our house as my wife is a school teacher and she uses a whiteboard for teaching. No more Big Lots dry erase markers for me -- I'm staying with these. We have a dry erase board that our kids use and when these became available I picked up the set for them to use. I sprayed the dry erase cleaner on the board and wiped it with the eraser and the marker came off as if it had been put on yesterday.I am always cautious about using cleaners because of the toxic nature of some of them. They seem like other dry erase markers I have used. I get so sick of reaching for a dry erase marker only to find out it's dried out and unusable! My dry erase board is pretty humble.

We use dry erase boards throughout our house and office, and are frequently purchasing refill markers.

I use dry erase markers in my work, and I must say I'm very pleased with these.

We have several dry erase boards in the house for reminders and projects.
