The seat height on the mesh extended chair base is adjustable between 24&#34; and 34&#34;. Being able to adjust the seat height anywhere between the 24&#34; to 34&#34; range will give me the ideal setting for most any task I can throw at it.This chair looks nice with the industrial grade black fabric for the seat, and mesh fabric for the back rest. I found the seat cushion and mesh back both comfortable even after extended use.The seat height can be adjusted from about 24 to 34 inches. I would have preferred being able to drop the seat down further given that it is difficult to roll the chair while sitting if your feet can't touch the floor. It gives slightly when I sit on it and there is a lever below the seat that is easy to reach that allows a person to raise and lower the chair. I find the seat and back very supportive and comfortable. At its lowest seat level it's too tall for a regular desk. The seat and back are a nice size, not small.My problem is the pneumatic lift is so strong that I have to literally lay across the seat to push it down and adjust it. The seat is about 17 1/2 inches from front to back which is about 2 1/2 inches shorter than my big computer chair. The seat adjustment is easy to use. The seat is firm and the back tilts slightly. The seat is a little on the small side so I would not recommend it for a very large person.I was impressed with how high this chair could be raised.
