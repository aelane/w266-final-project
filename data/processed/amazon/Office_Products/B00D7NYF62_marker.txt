The marker writes very well on it and erases easily. The marker has a magnet to stick to it, but that's not quite as secure as the others. It comes with a dry-erase marker, and it erases cleanly, without leaving streaks, smudges, or other fading reminders of what you wrote the day before.I hung this near my door where I use it as a "to do" list. You can't have the marker like that after you remove the tape. The included marker has a magnet so you can attach it to the writing area. It also comes with dry-erase marker and two magnets; the dry erase marker has a magnet in the lid so that it sticks to the board and can be easily found. The marker it comes with is also magnetic, something I haven't seen before. It comes with dry-erase marker and two magnets, To mount it you can use the included self-stick tape or magnets. So I think the included marker is not very good. The marker also holds onto the board via magnet, which is nice, since previous boards we've had the marker attachment clip, usually on the top or side, has broken easily, and it's hard to find a replacement. Those marker rings have rare earth magnets and never fall off.

The marker has its own clip/magnet and easily hangs around the board.

I'm sure I'd be misplacing the marker all the time if it weren't for this feature.

It takes marker well, and it's easy to erase the marker completely.
