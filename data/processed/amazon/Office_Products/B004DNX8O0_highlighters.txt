And unlike regular highlighters, the gel won't bleed through thin paper.In sum, if you don't mind the somewhat crayon-like behavior, the fact that this gel doesn't dry out and that it lasts a long time makes it worth trying if you're looking for a highlighter. They do not dry out like regular highlighters, and it is actually kind of fun to use them while reading. For as long as I've need highlighters, I've always used the marker kind, so using Sharpie's new Gel highlighter took a little getting used to. I have used conventional highlighters for years, typically in yellow. The highlighters are smaller in diameter than conventional but are easy to hold. really like these highlighters. These highlighters have a very nice color. If I were to purchase highlighters I would consider either this type orSharpie Accent Retractable Assorted 8 Packhighlighters which I really love. I use these highlighters in my textbooks for fast referencing and the different colors are handy for color coding different uses.In the past I'd never highlight in my books because of the ink soaking through but there isn't that problem with this Sharpie Gel highlighters,pretty cool! Otherwise, I prefer the old-school highlighters with heavier ink flows--even if they might bleed a bit through some types of paper. These highlighters are made up of a long gel stick that rests in the body of the pen. I saw these highlighters advertised in our Amazon Vine review selections and I picked them without hesitation. I love these gel highlighters. Lately I've been so disgusted with highlighters that I had quit using them. The highlighters always bled through thin pages, dried quickly, and smeared. I have been using highlighters since forever. It's not that these are bad highlighters, it's just that they're not especially impressive. I was so skeptical when I read about these highlighters. To those geeks- I salute you!Don't worry, these highlighters make super bright highlights just like the old marker highlighters.Once you go Sharpie Accent Gel, you can't go back! I like regular highlighters better. I like these highlighters quite a bit. These highlighters are gel-based, so instead of having felt tips, they have tips made of a hard-rubbery, translucent material. These highlighters are the most unique I've ever seen! I like highlighters that glide on, but these seem a little too think to me, almost like markers. Safe to say highlighters aren't going out of style.These new highlighters take a twist on the standard highlighters. Well these highlighters are almost like a gel stick. I will use these highlighters because they are in my possession and at the end of the day they are practical. These highlighters are bright and crisp, do not smudge as they dry quick, and do not bleed onto anything underneath it. These highlighters feel more like a wax pencil when you are using them, but are smooth on paper, and don't bleed or leave permanent marks on your desk if you go off the sheet like a sharpie. These are highlighters in the usual fluorescent colors which are applied to the paper via gel (like a crayon), unlike the more common felt-tip marker.

The Accent highlighters bleed through - particularly thin papers like Bibles and newsprint.WINNER:  GEL HIGHLIGHTERSMEAR:  The Gel highlighters DO smear.

The Accent highlighters also smeared, but the excess ink would dry out quickly.

That's why, for now, I will be sticking with traditional felt-tipped, chisel-point highlighters (e.g.,Avery HI-LITER Desk Style Highlighters 4 Pack (24063)orSharpie Accent Tank-Style Highlighters, 12 Yellow Highlighters(25005)), which are easier to control and allow me to go over important passages a second time to darken the color and make the whole sentences really stand out.
