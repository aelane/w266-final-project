This means that I can't have the arms oriented very far behind the mounting pole (about an inch is all), which isn't too bad because they don't recommend having the arms behind the pole if you edge mount it (due to that making the base want to rotate off the desk, I'm guessing). These arms have made my work so much easier to accomplish now that I can actually use the top of my desk and not have to work around the stands that hold my monitors...While the arms may not be able to swung around regularly as they need to be rigid to support to the weight of the monitors as far out as they reach. Because these arms allow for so much movement, it felt like they were all cramped up behind the monitors. The two arms are separate so you don't have to use both and adding the second arm later is as easy as slipping the ring over the pole and tightening.I practically have a new desk now and am already thinking of adding a TV to the second arm. The arms are very strong and this is a product that is obviously built to last.The one drawback is that the instructions are rather difficult to understand. The arms are extremely adjustable and hold their positions while still being maneuverable. The dual arms have hinges at the base that adjusts the height of each monitor. It's not difficult but without it the arms kind of have a mind of their own and will rise or fall depending on how much weight you have on them.Final Verdict:*  An excellent product which I am happy to own. While the 3M's black painted arms were metal just like the Ergotrons, the cable management casing felt flimsy and actually popped out of place a couple of times when I was adjusting my monitor.The metal arms are also simple square-ish tubes, not much flair; the Ergotrons just seem like there was a bit more time spent on the overall look of the product. The Ergotron arms make a visual impact, while the 3M product just looks functional. However, if you plan on using these arms to move the monitor constantly (or even moderately), the ball joint when left semi-loose always seems to creep out of position.
