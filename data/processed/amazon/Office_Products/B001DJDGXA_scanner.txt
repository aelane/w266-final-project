I bought this Canon scanner to replace an old scanner that had bit the dust. I bought this as a 2nd scanner for home use. I bought this scanner to be used in the car. (Although the last scanner we owned lasted over two years and still worked great when we gave it to someone else)This scanner isn't as clear as the one we did own, but it works well enough for what we use it for...which is just basic document scanning. I purchased this scanner to replace a very old HP 6200 legal flatbed scanner that died after 10yrs of occasional use. We wanted an inexpensive scanner, and we got what we paid for. The scanner itself does a decent job of scanning images, but it isn't as quick as I'd like. I had been wanting a scanner for a long time but it wasn't in my budget. If I were to buy another scanner, I would explore the ones that just feed a sheet through, but this is great for this style. I bought this scanner to copy dozens of old photos that are fading or are odd sizes; and this scanner lets me do that very easily, and the price seemed like a bargain. When I connect the scanner to the USB port on the front of my desktop, it disables the MyBook external drive.
