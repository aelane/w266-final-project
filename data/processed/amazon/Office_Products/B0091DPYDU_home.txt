You run a home office and need a device to handle all of your copying/scanning/printing needs.2. Highly recommended if you need a great home office printer. I don't have a home office - nor do I have any experience in printers the way some reviewers do. It fit on my home desk and under the hutch but it takes up about half the desk (standard student size desk) and you cannot open the cover without moving it. First off, if you are a home user, or have some place that is a bit restrictive of space, make sure you check the size of this printer before buying it. I ruledout casual home usage due to its bulk. Having a home scanner is particularly useful -- we can scan documents to email them around for miscellaneous business, store copies of important legal documents, deposit checks with our bank, etc. I have a home business office with a minimum of 4 networked computers as well as iPad, iPod and smartphones. The Epson WF-3540 seems to be more for home use to me. The 3540 is somewhat smaller and lighter, and will likely fit a little better in a home office. I use this at home for my home office slash small business needs.
