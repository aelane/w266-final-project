I am very pleased to have this laminator! This laminator is FAR superior to the do-it-yourself pouches. This is a fantastic laminator. Nonetheless, this is a good laminator. The laminator does an amazing job. I also found the laminator to be rather slow. This laminator does not require you to wait very long at all.In operation, the feed is very smooth and what comes out is a well-sealed project with no bubbles and no frayed edges. I ordered both this laminator and the Fellows Venus2 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HVUYKN0/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0). This laminator is a good basic laminator! I have a cheap Scotch laminator that I use for the kids' crafts and school projects. This laminator is great. This laminator will accept pouches up to 7 mil thick and 12.5 inches wide.Overall, I'm very happy with this product! I got a basic Scotch laminator on Amazon years ago and even got the same for my college daughter for school. Summary - excellent laminator for low volume or occasional use.Prior to this I had a Fellowes Saturn2 95 laminator, so I'll be comparing the two.
