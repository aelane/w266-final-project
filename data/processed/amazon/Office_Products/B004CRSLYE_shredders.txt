).Electronic shredders can be a blessing or a curse -- the curse part is usually due to the operator not following instructions or heeding warnings.Using it is a breeze. It is relatively quiet compared to other shredders though. You will know when it is on.MAINTENANCE:Unlike most shredders, the Swingline EX100 does not need to have the blades repeatedly oiled! (All shredders can spill some paper shreds, but this one is particularly bad in this regard. It's relately quiet compared with some other shredders I had used in the past, a big plus for using at home, especially when someone is taking a nap or asleep.3. Well, as excited as one can get about shredders, I suppose.PERFORMANCEWith the Swingline Stack-and-Shred 80X shredder, you stack up to 80 sheets of paper in the storage tray and when you're ready to shred, just flip the power on and the Stack-and-Shred starts cutting the paper into confetti. Many shredders, especially at this price range, can handle 10 or more sheets at a time, but shredding 80 sheets in a row would probably cause them to overheat. All the shredders I had used until this one required manual feeding. Other shredders for less money do a much better job of shredding junk mail and non-standard-size paper. You don&#8217;t wait around like you would with other shredders, and it can handle multiple shredding for an extended period of time. I have gone through several shredders over the past couple decades and this by far is the best one ever.The annoying thing that kept happening to me with other units was the top heavy thing, a tiny waste basket with the heavy top shredder part that always was constantly knocked over, spilling the tiny papers everywhere and I always dreaded dealing with all my papers to dispose of because of this.This Swingline Stack-and-shred is the best built shredding device I have ever seen, it's a medium sized shredder that fits nicely under the desk with a bin that pulls out of the front to empty when needed.I just went through a stack of papers that had been here waiting for my new shredder to show up.The standard sheets of paper I put in a stack and the machine chewed them up nicely, while my legal sized pages and envelopes I put through the manual bypass slot and I was quickly done and off to continue with life elsewhere, done with my cleaning duties.As I said before about the top heavy thing, it went on for years with several shredders of other brands and I had never seen a Swingline Stack-and-Shred until recently but Swingline is the ONLY brand I will ever consider buying ever again....I'M SERIOUS!Who ever designed this deserves a raise, it's brilliant I've tried several shredders over the last several years and most were pretty fantastic. Unlike other shredders that'll hide away in a corner or tuck easily under a desk, theSWINGLINE Stack-and-Shred 60X Hands Free Shredderneeds a little space. All my shredders in the past you had to remove staples this one didn't skip a beat. I have owned shredders for at least twenty years now. To be fair, most shredders I've used tend to jam once in a while. I've two shredders in my office the Swingline and a Fellows DM17C. One of our shredders won't turn off when it is in the automatic mode so we have to make sure it is unplugged. You have to do this with other shredders, too, but you can usually see the shredded stuff more easily to judge when it's time.4. I have had several shredders over the years, and this is the best by far! It is very quiet, and does not jam like many other shredders.I
