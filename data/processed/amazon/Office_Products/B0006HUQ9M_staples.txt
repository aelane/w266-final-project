It does not come with any staples which is a disappointment. Just remember staples make a good stapler better so try to avoid the cheaper house brand staples. Just buy staples, pop em in, and prepare to pass this off to your kids when they move out. 4 staples. 1" staples. 1 staples and it works fine so far. Once jammed hard, it seemed easier to jam with staples, must be a slight bend. It takes standard staples. 4 premium staples. But it needs "non-standard" staples, as do my heavy duty staplers; these other size staplers aren't carried by all merchants. The staples load well with a sturdy spring pulling up as you lift and the copper colored plate at the end of the spring makes it a bit easier to keep track of staples as you do the loading, if your eyesight isn't what it used to be.The box calls for using S.F. 4 staples for optimum performance. We loaded standard staples first and they worked fine for our needs. Using standard #4 staples the stack stapled together ok with enough of a fold under bend on the bottom to hold the stack together well. The staples come out easily and are straight and clean. Yes, it takes regular staples and it also opens up so that teachers, for example, can use it on bulletin boards.It does not come with any staples, so make sure you order those.
