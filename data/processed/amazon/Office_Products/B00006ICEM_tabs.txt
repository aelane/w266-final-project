The Wilson Jones tabs are durable, sturdy and for non-generics well priced. I do like that they have insertable tabs, as I have seen some lately that do not. I also like that I can switch out the tabs - you write on them (I know - old school - who doesn't type them on computer and print out anymore!). Easy to insert into the tabs so you can find what you are looking for in just a moment. Having 8 tabs provides a wealth of sections for any notebook. I prefer 8 tabs over 5 so what I needed. The tabs are nice and sturdy (even for clumsy hands). The Wilson Jones tabs are handy because they come packaged together as an 8-tab set. These tabs are exactly what they say they are. The tabs are assorted colors which are on the pale site and I find this attractive. The tabs are well spaced and there are 8, and they look very neat in a notebook. Write on tabs with pencil or non-permanent ink for full erasability. Larger tabs allow for longer titles. These are great divider tabs. These are your average tabs, except that they come in a package of 8. The tabs do NOT stick out past the edges of the binder pockets, so they're virtually worthless. You can also change out the tabs do they can easily be reused for anything.A must have product for so many different projects. They have plastic tabs which you can insert custom labels into (though you have to write on them by hand or create your own custom template without any help from the manufacturer). The tabs are nothing new...but they work well for our binders and hold up nicely.
