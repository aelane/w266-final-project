This is a well-designed product and is very useful. This is a product with a very specific use: wrapping a lot of presents when you don't have someone standing by to help with scissors. I had to say, this product is almost perfect.It is very convienent to use when both hands are wrapping a gift or doing project.However one of the drawbacks is that if you pull a little too hard, the tape packet comes out or the little piece on top opens up. This product works well and is super handy if you're having to repetitively put tape on a lot of areas. I just didn't like this product. Often too little or too much product is dispensed. Very nice product! According to the product information, there are 75 strips of tape. It seems like a sanity-saving product to me. Don't get me wrong, the product does what it is intended to do, it's just not something I will use again. I only wish they had made this product decades ago because it was a terrific idea.The only reason I gave this product four stars is that it only contains 75 strips in the pack. It just seems so completely unnecessary.I'm giving the product four stars because it works as promised and does make dispensing tape quite simple. This product was perfect - she was able to pull out pre-measured strips and didn't have to worry about fumbling with the tape dispenser. This product will serve you best when you are planning to wrap, or otherwise use several pieces of tape. This product seemed to be made for the OCD wrapper like myself. I admit that I loved the product. This product is comfortable on my wrist. The product is much like a tissue box, where the next piece of tape sticks up, ready to pull, and doing so should make the next piece pop-up. It is a handy little product, but I can't help feeling lazy when using it. Yes, this product makes things slightly easier, but I guess my point is it isn't completely necessary, and regular tape will still work just fine. Easy to stick & pull.I got this product at the right time,on my daughter's birthday.E
