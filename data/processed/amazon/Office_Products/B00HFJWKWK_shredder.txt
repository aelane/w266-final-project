Very substantial shredder. I really like this shredder. This shredder is great for home use it is quick and easy to use and does a very good job. Although it is somewhat loud, this comes with having a cross-cut shredder - they are all loud. This shredder advertises that it does six sheets at a time. I prefer a shredder that has a pull-out drawer for emptying, rather than having to lift off the top and then reposition it on the base unit. It's very lightweight and comes easy to put together (just place the shredder portion on top of the waste basket) and plug in. This shredder works well for the money. But if what you want is a basic shredder, get this one. We purchased this shredder for home use; bills, credit card applications, etc. The shredder has a nice heft and feels solid but it's perfectly manageable and easy to cart around. This is a great shredder to have in an everyday home office. If you want a basic shredder without extra features that are ultimately unnecessary, I recommend this shredder. But, I like how this shredder cuts it into smaller bits unlike the strip shredders.

However this is impossible in a crosscut shredder as the pieces are way too small to do anything with.

This is standard with any cross-cut shredder as even the larger office shredders require periodic lubrication.

I can also attest that the shredder cuts right through staples as well as credit cards.As far as price goes, the $29.99 Amazon Basics shredder is somewhere in the middle of all the 6-sheet cross-cut shredders that are offered on Amazon.
