love this phone and i think this is one of your best phones i can only hope you or should i say at&t don't stop making this phone Yet to be extremely fair, you could make a phone call - just don't expect even a simple led to light up when you select which phone line you want to use or even to light up if the phone rings.I have had a few Panasonic multi-line phones over the years and they all worked perfectly, even without a power adapter or batteries.This phone also has a POOR interface: When I plugged this phone in - using the supplied AC adapter - I got a bright red light on line 2 saying a message was waiting. The old phone looked almost identical to this, but this one has nicer buttons. The phone itself is decent enough, but the loud-speaker wasn't very clear. AT&T said they will replace the phone for $15, but it would be with another Model 993. That's important.But it is the user-interface that make me like this phone more than any other I have used. You can preset if you want the phone to default to handset, headset or speakerphone when you answer, and for me I often wear the headset most of the day and I can answer by touching only one button. First phone developed multiple problems in less that 15 days. Weight is not enough to keep phone in place when handset cord is stretched near to 2/3's length.Volume through Plantronics headset purchased with the phone is very low. Don't know if it's the phone or the headset. Speaker phone and handset volume seem adequate.Would not buy this combination again.
