These are really nice laminating pouches, and the 5mil thickness is a definite improvement over the 3mil. Just as with their laminating machines, their pouches seem to be of slightly better quality and are worth the additional cost. The Fellowes Glossy Laminating Pouches, 5ml, Letter Size, are thicker than the standard 3ml laminating pouches so make sure your laminator can take a thicker stock. Have never had one upset our laminating machine which can be finicky at times. We don't own a laminating device (at least not a large enough one), but I figured there was a good chance this could be sealed by our FoodSaver. These hot laminating pouches are great! The Fellowes laminating pouches are good and thick, with a glossy finish that is, understandably, reflective. These are great and seem to be to be even thicker than the standard 5ml laminating pouches.

I strongly recommend Fellowes Glossy Laminating Pouches for all of your laminating needs.

I have a Scotch laminating machine and the Fellows pouches fit perfectly and the end result is  beautiful.
