I kept hoping Post-It would make a Post-It note sticky "all over" and they have with Label Pads!I have always liked Post-Its as I can put a note where I want it and then remove it with no residue. I found that you can take one note and move it - from paper to clothing - and it doesn't lose its stickiness. How many of you have used a standard post-it note to label something & thing taped the bottom of the post-it to keep it stuck down? Now the Post-It note's are known all over the US and probably most of the modern world.These Post-It's are a new label idea. While moving one note to another page, my daughter ripped her math book because of the strength of the sticky note. If one wants to remove the note, it pulls off cleanly--no residue--and can be reattached to something else without tearing. I appreciate that these are brightly colored and stickier than normal, so when I leave a note on my copies, it's less likely to be inadvertently left on or lost. They are stickier than a regular Post-It note, yet still easy to remove. They stick again and again--longer-lasting than a typical Post-It note, too. They are stick over the whole note, rather than just one edge. Simply put, these 3M PostIt note work.
