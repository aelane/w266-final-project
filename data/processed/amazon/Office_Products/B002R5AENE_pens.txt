It is convenient to have these pens in various colors to signify who did the editing, and because of the ink there are no smudges to worry about.It would be great if there could be multi-colored pens (i.e., one pen with 2-4 colors)... These pens are pefect. I recommend these pens to anyone, whether you are a pen person, or whether you just need something to write with. The pens ship with annoying little plastic globs on the tips, and these don't come off in one piece but fragment into a mess of plastic bits when you remove them. They now appear to be price-competitive, but I'd still recommend the Sarasa and the Pilot G-Knock pens first because of their smoother writing.Update on function: After more than a week of paper-grading using various colors from this pack, it is clear that the manufacturer's claims of smooth, skip-free, clog-free writing are simply false. These pens skip considerably more than their competitors. These pens work great, write smooth and really stand out on paper. The comparable Uni-Ball pens offer a faster drying (and more permanent?) I love these multicolored pens. I love gel pens for their smooth writing and these are no exception. What is exceptional about this pens is the bright colors and the no-smudge quality with which they write. I hope not, because so far these pens are great!The pack comes with 8 colors: light blue, dark blue, black, orange, red, purple, green, and pink. Overall, I really like these pens and will probably pick up another pack when these run out or inevitably get lost! These pens write well and have a great selection of colors. Gel pens are the absolute best to write with - smooth and lots of great colors. I'll probably stick to my G2 and Signo pens for my regular black and blue purposes, but for fun colored inks, this is definitely the pack to go with. The pens write beautifully! Not sure, but after figuring this out, I really like the pens. So all in all, I'd recommend these pens. Very nice pens. These pens by Paper Mate are quite nice. The pens in this 8 pack are Black, Blue, Red, Purple, Green, Orange, Lt. Blue, and Pink. My pens worked well right off the bat. The black and blue pens will work fine for school projects. These pens like most roller-ball gel pens are a delight to use when the ink flows freely. I prefer gel pens over ball-point for their bold and fluid strokes, as well as the benefit of putting less pressure on the paper. These pens are no exception to this: the writing comes out in an uninterrupted line that is thicker than that of their ball-point counterparts. I have found myself using these pens for two main purposes.First, they are great in general writing. The pens are perfect for that.I have being regularly using these pens for the last couple of months, and would definitely consider purchasing them again when they are used up! Paper Mate usually makes good pens, which is why I chose to try these. Gel pens are always a security factor as they are hard to erase.Love the colors and they are strong enough to stand out! I really like these pens. These pens write SO smoothly! These pens come in eight vibrant colors; black, blue/black, red, purple, green, orange, light blue and pink. I couldn't find any, so I checked the pens more carefully and discovered that they had small bits of a sticky substance over the tips - I assume to keep them from leaking. I was pleased to discover that the pens will write "uphill" without skipping, and was even happier to find that they don't smear on glossy paper, allowing them to be used to label and sign photos (give them a few seconds to dry to be on the safe side!). I shared these two pens with my daughters, one a college student and the other working a job that requires meticulous organization, meaning she uses several different colors. We all agree that these are our new favorite pens. Love these pens!Nice bright colors.Smooth ink flow and is fast drying.Very comfortable to use and who does not love click pens so have no caps to worry about.I use gel pens all the time and these are by far my favorite now replacing my pilot pensthey have a similar feel to my pilot but are a little brighter ink. These pens also have a rubber piece so the hand doesn't slip. These are gel pens and they work fine. Grip was comfortable.The pens come with wax on the tips, which took a couple scrapes to clean off. Bear down and these pens don't work as nicely. Overall, for scrapping, they're better than the more expensive pens I've tried, so that did please me! I love pens -- especially gel ones, so I was thrilled to receive these which I had never tried before.COLOR SELECTION - is excellent: black, dark blue, red, purple, green, orange, bright pink an teal.CLICK FEATURE - no caps/tops is a bonus for me as I tend to lose the tops for pens, and they end up drying up --not these!GRIP - the grip and feel of these when writing is very good.SMEAR FACTOR - The ink DOES NOT dry instantly, so like many gel pens, let the ink dry to avoid messy smears.VERDICT - Recommended - 4/5 stars I was lucky enough to try these pens out for free through the Amazon Vine program, and they are very nice pens. I generally use Pilot G-2 pens, and these seem to function very comparable. The pens come in great colors and work fine for typical use. Plus I would worry that the pens would sprout legs and disappear. I have been using these pens for a while now and find them all to work nicely. Not so with these pens! These pens last and perform without a hiccup. These pens are useful for note taking students and others who want to organize by color. At a little more than a buck each, these pens are a bit on the pricey side. These pens do indeed create a smooth line. Great pens, perfect grip and super colors. These pens write very fluidly, dry quickly and the wide barrel cartridge holds a good quantity of ink. I would recommend these pens to everyone! I like gel pens and these are good ones - very smooth writing tip and bright ink. Although the pens are retractable, they come out of the package with little rubber covers on the tips that are a pain to remove. This pens are good but really nothing wonderful.

I use these pens for grading papers as the colors are easy to distinguish from the black text and they give me an option beyond the dreaded "red pen."

It's hard to get excited about pens but sometimes a product just working as advertised exceeds expectations given so many don't.These pens have a great variety of vibrant colors, a comfortable grip and smooth flow of the gel ink.
