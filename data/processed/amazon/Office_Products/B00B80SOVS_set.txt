A great set of gel-pens. And this set delivers. Overall, the set seems like a lot because you get a lot with this. Overall a nice set, but like I said, I don't understand why some are duplicated while others aren't. )This is a great set of gel pens for adults or students. What a wondeeful set of pens! A set of 68 colored gel pens for about 41 cents per pen (based on the current Amazon price) seems like a very good deal. The pen set is still a staple in their arts and crafts sessions.I grabbed a few pens and began writing with them. Despite the set not being 68 separate colors, it is a decent set that provided my children with hours of entertainment. The set is shipped with the pens in little bags so you have to put them into the stand, but that's no big burden. And this TEKwriterUSA set is an amazing selection of 68 fluorescent, opalescent, and shimmery metallic colors. This set works nicely for those purposes. I couldn't believe that this set came with 68 different colored pens!I am extremely satisfied with the quality of the markers. I would definitely recommend these and will definitely get another set in the future (or as a gift).I like that the set comes with a stand to display the pens, should you like this option. This set of pens has been tested by a doodle happy teenager who journals and draws all the day long. This is a set that would go well in a classroom, an art studio or a craft room.This is a very nice set of gel pens that offers a very good variety of colors and types, suitable for all manner of creative projects. This is a great set of gel pens for the price. This is the nicest set I have had thus far, and out of 68 pens, only one was dried up. The set includes regular gel, metallic, glitter, pastel and neon pens, but there are a lot of duplicate colors and it seems to me that there are too many darks and not a good selection of pinks or purples as you'd expect to find in a collection like this. Overall though, this is a good set. Overall, I will gladly give this set a glowing 5 star review. So I would say this is a fabulous set for any crafter, scrap-booker, artist, or kid with some cool coloring books! I would definitely recommend this set to other party planners.
