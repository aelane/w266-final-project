If it were a long draw tool like a grinder or sander running at those kind of pressures you would need a much larger one.A point worth mentioning is that contrary to what you read here in the reviews, the retail packaging model does not come with staples. POW at 100 PSI setting this tool kicks some serious butt. This tool is a winner! I would recommend this to any one looking for a tool like this. This is a fine tool for small tasks. Overall, a good tool and useful for a DIY homeowner. The tool is solid but not so heavy you'll get hand fatigue after a few minutes.I tried it on some soft wood things I had here-I think pine? Overall this is a great tool for your home and craft workshop. The Arrow Fastener Arrow PT50 Staple Gun is a great tool to have in any collection.

What I wish this tool had was a little window  in the magazine.

This is a great tool for a homeowner type and would be very useful for upholstery, crafts, and things of that nature.
