Saving paper and getting the ability to duplex is worth the extra cost.- Scanning works fine.Honestly I don't use this feature as much as I should because I copy more. Coming from the Epson R380, loading more paper from the rear was very easy. I usually archive paper documents into digital form. The paper tray is made of light-weight plastic and it feels flimsy. There is no paper feeder for scanning/copying. I have to scan/copy each paper individually. It prints lined paper and grid paper, which has been very helpful for my home-school. You don't have to change the paper out.Cons:*Depending on your needs, this printer might be a bit bulky. The paper tray seems a bit flimsy, but I have not had any problems with it. The paper tray holds 120 sheets of plain paper and 20 sheets of photo paper. It accepts paper sizes from 3.5 x 5 inches to 8.5 x 14 inches, including No. If you have it loaded with photo paper, you will have a beautiful 5x7 photo print waiting at home. I am printing on Kirkland Glossy Photo paper in both 8 1/2 x 11 and 4x6. This is great paper, and the Epson produces extraordinary results on it. That is great for saving paper when printing text documents but of course, do you really want to print text documents with this printer? You can keep plain paper loaded and 4x6 photo paper at the same time.
