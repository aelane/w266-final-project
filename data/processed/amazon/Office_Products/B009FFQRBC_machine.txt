It is also intuitive to use this machine. The Swingline GBC Fusions 1100L Laminator is a great laminating machine. I use my machine for laminating signs and pictures for the church bulletin board, my study group, and my TOPS chapter.These items can be reused over and over again. The machine I have now takes forever to warm up and is old enough to worry that it might give up on me. Having this machine in the house might make the process easier - certainly without the elaborate warm up and wait - and the one-minute setup makes it more likely to be used.This is the best laminator I have ever used. This laminating machine makes extremely clear and sealed lamination.It is compact and good looking for your desk. This is a very simple and intuitive machine. I love that this machine takes all three thicknesses, by the way.One thing I've noticed in laminating thicker paper (Epson matte-surface inkjet photo paper, for example) is that the trailing edge tends to bend a bit--it's not perfectly flat. This is a stellar machine and I'm thrilled to own it. Sure, it's a nice machine, but not at twice the price. They glided through the machine quickly.I don't understand why Swingline doesn't include a few lamination pouches with the laminator. My last machine could only handle 3mil.There is a bit of a smell when you first use it, but that eventually goes away. This is a cool little machine which I have been using for the last three weeks. The machine takes documents of less than 9 inches and the nice feature is when the lamination is complete, the green light indicator goes on.The laminating paper is essentially a bag into which I slide the picture/poster/certificate and feed it in crease first. What goes for one may not apply to another.This Swingline GBC Fusion 5000L 12" Laminator is a sharp looking, well made machine. The machine heats up quickly and can be adjusted to feed different sized pouches. The machine goes to sleep (power down) automatically after 30 minutes in case you walk away and forget to turn it off.There is a cold setting on the machine that allows you to use those self stick pouches. The machine heats up quickly enough, and the speed at which the page goes through is about the same amount of time as it takes to set up the next page, so you can work almost continuously. Don't know if it is the machine, or The Heat Seal pack I am putting them in? This little machine was a new experience for me.The Swingline is small and compact with a solid footprint. The machine does get warm, but not warm enough to burn yourself (or for a child who might accidentally touch it).Put whatever you're laminating in between the two pages of the laminating pouch, sealed edge first, and put the pouch in between the two marks on the laminator until it "catches" and then it slowly goes through the machine on its own and comes out the other end. Because this compact machine has no sleeve, though, it's important to wipe it clean after each use. Should the machine jam, it automatically reverses, and if it doesn't, you simply press the reverse button. The machine also got really really hot. With this machine, it still got hot, but not as much. I love how this machine heats up so quickly. I used Scotch Thermal Laminating Pouches with the machine and it worked like a charm. This machine must be the Queen of Laminating machines! This machine feeds front to back.
