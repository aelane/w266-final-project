Regular paper is less useful than ever in the modern office, so I'm not sure why they are doing this product. It's nice that it comes with paper clips and paper, but it has very little utility, even as a paperclip holder. Pro - The paper clip and paper tilt backward so it keep them from sliding out of the unit.3. Con &#8211; The paper area is larger than that of a standard post it note so when I go to replace the paper that was provided, it&#8217;s not going to fit right. If you use paper clips all the time like I do then I doubt it will hold enough. It does come with paper and paper clips, though!The sleek, modern design would work nicely in just about any office environment. And, why does the paper overhang the actual device? When I take one paper clip out for use, more than one tends to follow despite the slight angle of the holder.The area for the memo pad sits post-its, sticky notes, and notepads no bigger than 3.5 x 3.5 inches perfectly. However, I wouldn't recommend it for paper clips. I really appreciate that the paper pad isn't post-it type for once. I use it for note paper (as shown) & the slots for post-its. Personally, I make note paper out by cutting up old documents and the slot size is fine for that. However, I don't use it to hold paper clips, as I already have a holder for that. I did not find one listed on Amazon, perhaps Swingline will be adding those later.The paper slip slot is not that great, I prefer a magnetic paper clip holder.

This is a paper clip and small note pad holder and does exactly what it is intended to do - hold paper clips and post its.

This could easily double as a sturdy paper weight.

The paper section is the right size for not only the paper that is included, but also those larger square post it notes.I know the picture shows the middle slot as great for paperclips, but that isn't my choice.
