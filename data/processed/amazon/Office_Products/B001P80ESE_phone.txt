I have owned this phone system for more than a year, and love it. It replaced another Panasonic phone that had been in service for about six years. Although that phone still worked, it appeared that the battery was starting to fail. This phone comes with a lot of useful features, such as answering machine, handsfree speaker (on the base station and remotes), caller ID, and intercom. This has been one of the best and most dependable phone(s) I have ever owned. This is the best phone we ever bought. The phone base for the cordless handsets recharge the batteries. The phone ringers have a variety of nice tones and tunes to choose from.8. I researched this phone system on various web sites before buying it here, and they all say it has an option of an audible message alert. LOVE IT!I'm very happy with this phone. The phone will not fall out! Great phone all around! In short, this is a nice phone to have at home! This phone comes with two cordless which is what I really need at home so that I could easily make and pick up a call anywhere in the house. Also, the phone has great features (answering machines, caller ID, miss call, etc. ), though you need to subscribe with your phone service provider to use certain features. I believe the phone system itself had developed problems when calls would be dropped without warning, low battery no longer beeped etc.Replaced the system with this one. Even moved more phone usage to mobile phones as my nest gets empty. As I use Cox phone system I likely will not use the answering machine.

100-number phone book, which can be copied between units either in total or one entry at a time, and nine phone number groups that you can give custom names.

The phone will ring (about once) until it identifies the number, then beep and goes to a busy signal and then drops the call!

This means when the phone rings, you answer it by simply picking it up off the charger.
