These dividers are very nice and will last a long time. Very stylist and very study.write on your dividers and then when need to change and just erase andre-wirte on it.A great buy! I love these dividers. These dividers are very pretty in the orange and green mod print. These dividers are made of plastic and will not tear from everyday use.The tabs are also reusable, easy to write on and wipe clean with a damp cloth or pencil eraser.They are available in two sizes, 5.5 X 8.5 and 8.5 X 11, but haven't hit the local stores yet. But if you want inexpensive sturdy little dividers, these work. These dividers are STRONG. This dividers have given new life to my agenda since now I have information easily accesible by colo code. Nice, sturdy dividers. These dividers are much more durable than cardboard or cardboard/plastic tab products. They are great dividers and it's easy to write on the tabs. You get what you pay for and these are write-on, durable dividers. I find these dividers to be extremely useful for organizing my many scattered lists and helping to contain my notes all in one place. I was excited to try these dividers as well as theAvery Mini Durable View Comfort Touch Binder with 1 inch Round Ring, 5.5 x 8.5 Inches, Green (17346)The dividers are fun and colorful and if aesthetics appeal to you, you'll find yourself smiling every-time you open your mini binder. The dividers are made of a hard plastic, very sturdy, and colorful. These dividers are good because you can erase them and write on them again. The dividers themselves are pretty thick and durable, so they would probably last a good long time. These dividers work great with the mini binder and notepaper. I like that the dividers are plastic, so they're no tearing where the holes are punched like sometimes happen with paper dividers. These dividers are for use with half-size folders (8.5 x 5.5"). These dividers look exactly like the picture. I'm really enjoying using these handy dividers in my mini-binder. These dividers go in the Avery Comfort Touch Mini Binder.They have extra holes though so you can use them in other small binders or 3 ring organizers.I've had good luck writing with rolling ball markers on these dividers but if you really want to keep changing what you write on the dividers use a pencil. These dividers are easy to write on and (just as important) it's easy to erase what you wrote on them. Sorry, I can't recommend these dividers because of the strong plastic smell. There are five dividers; each one has an attractive pastel color: blue, gray, aqua, yellow and violet. It's great to have dividers for use with my DayTimer. The dividers are made of a fairly thick plastic with write-on tabs. These dividers are a nice quality plastic, with 7 holes, to fit 5 1/2 x 8 1/2 binders. The dividers were great for allowing me to keep notes for each subject. The dividers along with the binder and filler papers (sold separately) is a perfect size for carrying in a purse.The product information advertises these as write-on tabs. I just received the dividers with no binder.Unfortunately, I do not have a binder small enough to be able to use these dividers. I wish that I did, because I think it would be helpful to have dividers that are reusable, where you can write on them, erase what you wrote, then write something else on them, as needed.These dividers also seem very durable, as they are plastic. If your somewhat klutzy like me, you can easily erase or if you want to use the dividers for a different purpose later, you don't have to shell out more money. These dividers work very well. The dividers easily fit into my Avery 5.5 x 8.5 Binder. These dividers are very sturdy; the entire divider sheet is made of an opaque plastic, making it near-impossible to accidentally rip/tear it. The dividers themselves take a lot of abuse, pen or pencil. Not only did I receive dividers but a great notebook and paper as well. Bought these  dividers to go with my other purchase of: Russell+Hazel Mini Red-Orange 9 x 7 Inch Binder (10730) - they fit perfectly and the colors go so well together. The dividers seem durable and although I only have them a short while, they seem like a long-lasting product. These dividers are sturdy and well made. I had originally planned on using the dividers in my Franklin Covey 7 ring notebook but I was pleased to have a binder to use.This notebook is a great size (5.5 x 8.5) to bring to meetings, especially lunch meetings, so note taking won't take over the whole table as it does with a full size notebook. Since the dividers are plastic, they're sturdier than the typical paper dividers and they're nicer looking, too. The dividers themselves have 7 holes punched down the side so you have flexibility to use them in almost any type of mini binder. I would not hesitate to buy these dividers again.As an aside, Vine reviewers were also sent a Comfort Touch BinderAvery Mini Durable View Comfort Touch Binder with 1 inch Round Ring, 5.5 x 8.5 Inches, Green (17346)so we could insert the dividers in to an actual book, and I was really impressed with that item as well. The Comfort Touch Notebook is very sturdy, well made, and it is very easy to get the dividers in to and out of the binder. These dividers are wonderful and very durable. These are sturdy little dividers, and I love that they are so cute! The dividers have held up well too. I especially like these dividers when it comes to planning homeschool lessons.I recommend using only a ball-point pen.I generally like using Avery products such asAvery Easy Peel White Address LabelsorBusiness Cardsin my home office. These dividers are designed for use in mini binders (5 1/2 x 8 1/2 inches). These dividers are perfect for organizing papers within your mini binder. The dividers are seven-hole punched, so they fit into a variety of binders, including many planners. Labeling the dividers is easy; you can write on the tabs directly with pen or marker (they wipe clean), or you can make labels for the the tabs. I thought I was getting only the dividers, that I was planning on using in an old small folder that I have, but instead Vine sent me the binder and the paper, too!T
