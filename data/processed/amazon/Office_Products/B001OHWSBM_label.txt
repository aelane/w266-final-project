I was excited to find that a repositionable label is now available.The labels are the same size as the 8160, although when comparing both sheets of labels they appear smaller because the 8160 has a permanent white strip between the label columns. This actually makes the newer label, template 5160, easier to remove from the sheet. I mistakenly stuck the wrong label onto a bottle. I was able to stick this label to an envelope, remove it without leaving behind any sticky residue, and repeat several times. If you try to remove the label, you struggle and often tear the paper that the label is glued onto.These labels solve the problem by giving you the ability to remove them after they are pressed to paper. So often a label is placed not quite straight or on the wrong box or envelope. Then, the label is easy to remove and reposition on the object to be mailed. Once repositioned the label again remains firmly affixed.No more crooked, pooly positioned mailing labels! Being able to remove the label without peeling off half of it with the sticker residue, and wasting time trying to clean a label off, is a time saver. Who doesn't love actually being able to fix that crooked label. Avery has actually perfected the perfect label with these repositionable labels! That's what you need in a label, right?If you have ever wasted a label because you stuck it on crooked or on the wrong box, your worries are over. You then must hold it down or really rub the label to make it stick. *Rounded label corners, not squared/pointed. You can remove them if you haven't pressed them down firmly yet, but often it causes the label to curl, the writing to crack or the paper rips. That allows you to remove and replace the label on an envelope or box without damaging it. If you wanted to place a label on the outside of the box of labels itself, to inventory stock for example, you'd have no problem removing the label when you no longer needed it. When peeling off a label after several days, the damage was more severe, and I needed to be careful to avoid pulling up the surface. You can choose a specific label template, including a blank one, one with an address layout, and several with images that will print in addition to your text.

Because you often need to remove a label, but conventional labels leave a residue; these don't.

For Printshop, you simply choose the label size and they have templates (I don't use them) or you design it yourself.

Then you choose which label on the sheet of blank labels you want to start with--then you choose how many labels to make.
