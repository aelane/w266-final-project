There isn't too much to write about when it comes to labels. And, while I'm sure they're not environmentally perfect, these are more "green" than the traditional labels. The labels and packaging use vegetable inks. So when you need labels, be sure to grab the "green" ones. These labels fit that requirement.I printed 10 sheets of these with my OkiData laser printer using the Avery 5160 template. Like other Avery labels, these came out fine making the turn thru the normal path.They peel easily from the backing and stick firmly to the page.The Bottom Line: They meet the requirements as stated above, and I will continue to use them. Avery always makes the best labels and these are no exception. I love that these labels are both "eco-friendly" AND work well--too often I've found environmentally friendly products that sacrifice quality, but not this time! They work great and I'll continue to purchase these whenever I need labels. The labels are a crisp white color and stick well, and look professional and clear on my envelopes. In the past, I have found Avery labels to be reliable and easy to use. These labels are no different. The labels peel easily and adhere well to any envelope. These labels are easy to use and great for the environment. These are not glossy labels and do not have a high end finish or sheen, but for everyday use as labels which will need to be functional and then recycled, these are perfect! If you need many labels for mailings, I'd recommend this product. If you are looking for a more environmentally friendly alternative to other labels I can recommend these. Avery labels are awesome. These enviro-friendly labels just seem gimmicky. The labels peel from the backer sheet easily. The generic labels might seem a lot cheaper, but these are well worth the extra dough. I've been using Avery labels since my first pacbell PC in the early 90's; maybe even longer than that! These labels are great and I love that they're eco friendly. Why buy regular labels if you can be a little green and get these? I was honestly expecting these green labels to be different from the regular white ones but surprisingly, they're pretty much the same. Now to be perfectly fair, the EcoFriendly labels and their packaging are made from 100% post consumer content. While these labels are different in terms of materials, they are every bit as good as the non-green version. What these Avery labels offer is a way of being eco friendly. The labels themselves are recyclable. So in a whole these are labels for the eco conscious, which I am. (I find that the clear labels stick better than the non.) They function as well as the regular labels made by Avery. They print well and avery always makes it easy to make great looking labels with their free templates. I applaud Avery for finally offering "green" labels made from recycled paper. Incidentially, the labels are crisp white. These labels work as well as any labels you may purchase, but have the nice added feature that they are made from recycled products. These labels pretty much the same as the regular ones, so I am not sure of the point. Why didn't AVERY just make their regular labels more eco-friendly without making a fuss about it? These labels work great in my laser printers and I've not had any jams with them. These adhesive labels are extremely easy to use. The labels printed straight and in the middle of the labels with no smudging or any other problems you may find with printing on something that isn't regular stock paper. And these labels get bonus points for being made out of recycled paper. I have used these labels with great success. the labels i printed using my inkjet/photo printer dried quickly and the prints crisp. the labels peel easily and stick well.T
