This is the best printer i have used along with the epson 845. It drys immediately it comes out of the printer but it jams on heavy paper like papers as thick as 300lbs. They were easy to put into the printer. Sadly the WF 7010 is discountinued and I needed the same printer so I bought this. Over all printer is a great printer. Otherwise, I prefer this printer. This is a stunning printer -- beautiful visually and prints great, too. The printer is HUGE, though, which I don't mind, but it could be a turnoff for some people. It would not fit where my current much smaller printer is, so I had to find another spot in my home office. The printer takes about 5 minutes to initialize after installing new ink cartridges. All in all, the Epson WorkForce WF-7510 is just a great all-in-one printer for home or the office.Pros:Fast.Excellent features.Excellent all around performance.Easy to setup.Wireless connection.Moderately priced.Cons:Large and heavy.Photo printing results good, but not great. Upon trying to figure out if this printer lacked anything, the only thing I could come up with is the option for automatic two side printing. This printer also appears to take the same cartridges as the 635/645 ( and I assume many others), but also takes the same version in extended size (and I believe comes with these as well), which means you probably will save a bit on ink, and will have to change them less.Overall I've loved every Epson printer I've had, and this one continues that tradition. It's not a negative on this printer really... it just makes it looks more professional and less susceptible to bumps and damage. But this Epson printer really does all of its functions beautifully. The printer is a tad more `old-school' than many of its current competition. For a strictly-business printer such as this I wish it had a 500 sheet capacity. Look, any WorkForce printer is great. I absolutely love this printer! This also allows me to put the printer in a location other than next to my computer and/or router as all these features are running completely over the Wifi.Finally, the printing. I've had EPSON printer previously and they always seem challenging to set up, and so was this one. The printer was quickly and I printed out a test page. This is a very high-quality printer with great speed and functionality. )This printer has a fairly large footprint, so if you intend on using it on a smaller desk, you may want to think again. The printer is fairly easy to set up. If you need a printer to handle duties in your small office this is one printer to really consider. Its got all printer functions you could need and then some. I was very pleased with this printer. This is a great little printer - set up was a breeze, and I can automatically print to it using Google Print from anywhere on my iPad (I've even sent things to it from school to home). ), this printer scales them down to about 40% of their size, making them kind of unusable for mailing. Then, if you open the printer from System Preferences or leave the icon in the dock, you have to scan from the application in order to scan directly onto your computer. My very first printer was an Epson and I used to get so frustrated with it because it constantly jammed and it was really expensive to buy ink for.Well, today I am COO of a major financial advisory firm and I was at a conference in Atlanta regarding operations and technology (yeah, I was really bored). I tried it from my lap top and I was astonished.Before, I had a Brother (which is also a very good printer), but I have to say, my "techie" friend was right. I bought this printer because of its capability to print, copy, and scan 11x17 paper, mostly engineering drawings, as well as letter and legal size paper, and also because it has a wireless interface. When they titled this printer a Workforce they knew what they were talking about. Warning - check the printer dimensions before purchasing. I turned on the printer and it walked me through all the steps, from installing the ink-cartridges to getting set up on my wireless network. All I had to do was choose the printer under settings and in seconds I was printing from my phone. )The printer does come with USB and card reader slots, but I may never use them again.The ONLY drawback to this printer that I have found (apart from the sheer size) is that the paper tray is finicky. Because the printer is still under warranty Epson is sending me a free replacement and shipping label to return the defective printer. I have both this printer and the Epson Artisan 1430Epson Artisan 1430 Wireless Wide-Format Color Inkjet Printer (C11CB53201). We put the printer in the closet and print from our laptop, desktops, and ipad/iphones and it works great.Unlike the Artisan 1430 you DON'T need a USB cable (it doesn't come with it) for the initial wi-fi setup. Instead you print under a generic Epson printer. I hated my previous printer. It was an HP printer, and it messed up just about every time I had to use it. This Epson printer is wonderful. It is a rather large printer, so make sure your desk has enough room for it! But if you're planning on hiding this printer in some cabinet or on a small printer cart, you may want to rethink things. If you think about it, the printer can print up to 13" x 9" and scan up to 11" x 17", so of course it's going to be bigger than your standard printer.- We have this printer on a good-sized table, and I was thrilled to see it doesn't violently shake while printing! it printed - I could easily use this printer to print good quality color photos.- The wireless setup is an absolute breeze (though you do have to install software on every computer you want to use it from), and I love that I can use the free Epson app to print from my iPad/iPhone.- I don't fax, so can't speak to that function, but it seems to be simple to fax a document from your computer wirelessly, judging from the program installed on my computer.- I love the 200-sheet paper capacity!All in all, if you're looking for a color wireless printer/scanner, as long as you don't mind the size of this one, I can't recommend it highly enough. Bigger than I expected.Sure, I read that it is a printer for `large format' documents, but I must admit that I didn't read the dimensions in the description. I've mixed feeling about this printer. The printer manufacturers seem to insist on passing on the USB connection cable, and there was no Ethernet one either. It shows a streamlined printer options, but everything else is almost the same, and has a "Windows 98" feel to it.As, a summary,Pros:+ Great build quality/materials+ Fast prints on normal mode+ Really vivid colors for photo printing+ Easy WiFi/Cloud connection+ Large paper sizes+ High capacity ink included with the deviceCons:- Only a single tray- Slower on fine quality printing- Illegible draft prints- Windows driver installation hiccups- Lackluster fax optionsOverall, this printer is a really high quality product. I've wanted a wireless printer for some time, but really couldn't justify the purchase since I already have a print/scan/fax device as well as a very nice photo quality color printer. This printer is by far the best and easiest to use of any printer I've used at home. I love being able to store my printer in another room and simply print to it.It prints really quickly (15 B&W;/minute, 8 in color) and it has two trays that can hold 250 sheets. Overall, it's a great printer and has a lot of options for everything from printing, faxing and scanning/copying.
