I can't imagine every buying a printable label that WASN'T made by Avery. I hate taking a label off even a little bit because then it will lose it's sticky-ness sitting there in a drawer until I use it next.-If you REALLY have trouble peeling off labels, then get this. They are easy to peel off and you get a perfect label every time that actually sticks to the envelope and becomes part of the envelope as well. I hate wasting a bigger label (like an Avery 5160) for return addresses and have even cut them in half sometimes. There are many address label companies but Avery is a home run every time, no matter what size label or need. It might be better to just go for a larger label. Not a cheap label. If you're looking for a really small no-nonsense label that sells with plenty in a pack, this product might be for you.However, I personally feel they're a little too small for practical use. Using a larger-sized label allows users to fit four lines of text, a larger font size, or even a piece of clip-art.

Whenever you need a label, just peel it off.

At first, I wondered if I would want to use a label this small and then when I printed a sheet, I realized that these are perfect for use on envelopes, notes, and anything you want to identify.

Like every label sheet I find it takes a little working out a template depending on what program you're starting with.
