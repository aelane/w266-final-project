They go through my laminator quickly and smoothly. I  own the Swingline laminator and use these Swingline Laminating Pouches. They go through the laminator smoothly with no problems. Coupled with a good laminator (I have a Fellowes Saturn), this works very well to create clear, bubble-free, wrinkle-free laminations.I'm planning to send laminated photos of my family to my toddler nephew so he can handle photos of us without worry about ripping them, sticking them in his mouth, etc. They worked well in my laminator, and I didn't have any trouble with bubbles or creases. I have a laminator I use at work (which I bought for laminating charts I use frequently.) Ever since I got my personal laminator, it seems I am always finding another reason to laminate something around the house. Just remember to set your laminator to 5 mil so you get enough heat to seal the pouch. I don't own a laminator but have used the self-laminating sheets for years. Works great with my Fellowes laminator. You will need a thermal laminator. I use them with my Fellowes Saturn laminator. It rolls smoothly through the laminator. I tested the Swingline Thermal Laminating Pouches in a 9.5" thermal laminator by another leading manufacturer, and they worked beautifully. First of all, preheat the laminator to the appropriate thickness setting. When the laminator is ready, slide the laminator in according to the laminator's instructions. I have a Scotch laminator, and have always used Scotch laminating pouches, as that's what we have available here. We have Scotch laminator and the pouches can get expensive to buy. I love my laminator and these pouches are wonderful. I've positioned carefully and fed straight into the laminator (in my case, theFellowes L80-95 personal laminator), and so far I've had no problems.These pouches work well, though they're a bit tight on space for full-sized items. I used a Fellowes laminator with Fellowes laminator pouches and Swingline laminator pouches. I didn't think I'd be using my laminator that frequently when I purchased it last year but it's fast becoming a handy tool I use for lots of jobs. I recently invested in a laminator and immediately forgot what I wanted/needed to laminate. I used a Fellowes laminator and experienced no problems at all. I used a Swingline GBC laminator that I got on a deal of the day before Christmas and the pouches work perfectly with it. When your laminator is ready, feed pouch into the laminator entrance. I got a laminator for Christmas and just a few laminator pouches, so I looked forward to receiving these. I use these with a Scotch laminator and they work very well.

My former laminator had control over how hot the laminator got and I'm sure I could have used this pouch with no warping or bedning by making adjustment.These are in the middle of the pack value-wise.

I have a laminator, but didn&#8217;t have any of the smaller pouches on hand for when I wanted to do a smaller item.

It is amazing what you can find to laminate once you have a laminator.
