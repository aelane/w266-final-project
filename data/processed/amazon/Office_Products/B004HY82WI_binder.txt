The binder is not the sturdy plastic white binder kind, but instead has somewhat of a malleability to it. I decided to use this binder for pages of photographs, etc.It looks great on the shelf! OK, this is a plastic binder. This binder has a good look, definitely a step up from the standard plastic ones you see. This is a sturdy binder, with solid rings that looks like it will hold up to a great deal of use. The binder is strong and looks much more elegant than most binders but I wonder how the stitching will hold up over time. It's pretty cool really because the binder clips separate from the cover when the binder is at the end of it's useful life. This is an average binder which a couple of nice qualities and a couple that aren't so great.The upside is that it is made of a durable plastic and PVC free. This Wilson Jones Durable Hinge Poly Binder with Removable Ring is a very good, durable, inexpensive binder. Very attractive and functional binder with stitching around the borders makes this just a cut above. I am the binder QUEEN. I have a binder for just about everything (and I love sheet protectors and pocket dividers!). That said, I'm not thrilled about this binder. This binder has some pretty serious flaws, at least for me. This binder was about eight dollars as of the time of writing this review, which is indeed more expensive than your average cheap three dollar white binder (we all know the type). It's not a binder to use and bring with you to class or to a project site. Very nice durable binder. I probably should have gotten a 1.5 or 2 inch binder, but this handled the job. Having the 3 ring binder on the back fold instead of the center binding is a HUGE benefit. The binder can be easily disassembled for recycling. The binder has a leather appearance, resplendent with stitching. It is a unique binder that will stand out from all others. The binder is available in three muted, old-fashioned colors of brown, pink and green.The binder really doesn't need customizing. I was a little disappointed with this binder because I was expecting a much thicker cover material, not a lightweight compressed recycled material which is an attempt as resembling leather. The binder has the feel of a more standard three ring binder, but despite the firm structure, it is very, very light in weight. This is a more professional looking binder. I expect to pass this binder down for many generations. This is a really classy, professional looking binder. This is an attractive binder. This binder is made from a sturdy poly material, and it has quite a few positive aspects:- It's attractive. This binder does look like leather but is made of a heavy plastic. This is a neat looking binder that would be perfect as a notebook. The binder has instructions to take out the metal parts for recycling. The binder is made from PVC Free foam polypropylene material . The binder is well made and sturdy. This is actually a very nice binder, despite its added ability to be fully recycled. This binder is instead durable and stylish! I suppose if you don&#8217;t expect to put your binder through a lot of abuse, and you&#8217;d like a more sophisticated design, this binder may be just what you are looking for. The three-hole binder clip is well-constructed. I like that this binder is recycled and recyclable. Wilson Jones produces a practical binder that any student or anyone seeking out a way to keep papers organized. This binder is about as solid as you can get. This is a very attractive binder that would stand out from others when sitting on a shelf. The Wilson Jones Durable Hing Poly Binder is a very nice looking binder suitable for professional use at the office. Functionally is as you would expect and I would recommend this binder to anyone looking for this style. Nice looking binder. I really like this binder. For them, I have found that a flexible binder in general will make it farther though the school year. The binder is flexible, yet thick and sturdy feeling. This PVC free binder is made of an easy to clean material...just wipe and go!I found this binder perfect for keeping plastic pages I use for storing film negative strips.
