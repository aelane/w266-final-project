Each has a color coded clip and color-coded rubber grip. I think it could work if you use the right color and if your Bible doesn't have ultra-thin pages like mine. Some of the color names sound like desserts, others sound like Jimmy Buffet drinks :)Just like theBIC Great Erase Grip "Pocket" Dry Erase Marker, Fine Point, Assorted, 6 Dry Erase Markers (GDEP61-Ast), they have a comfortable rubber grip that matches the color of the individual marker, and you can attach them pen-style to your shirt pocket/pocket-protector.Some of the colors may be too close to each other, which can be a plus if you like them or if multiple people/kids are sharing the same set. I love the broad, vivid color selection and the easy-open organizer pack is great for keeping things neat at my desk or to toss in my bag.These pens write super smooth with an ultra fine line.This is what the package states:* Marks on glass, metal,plastic,photos, foils, coated paper, oily and damp surfaces. I love the color variety. You can easily see the color bands (to identify what you need, something you can't always do when you store them vertically in a holder) and more important, the plastic package they come in opens out to easily access the pens in each of three separate sections.This packaging makes it even more gift-friendly.Ergonomics: I'm used to thinner plasticy pens but I liked the feel of these. I have every color and width of Sharpies that was ever made. But for the occasional color I don't have to blend with them, I bought these. The color lasts a long time, but dries very quickly. We love the color range and as a parent, I especially like the storage box.

I've been using theBIC Mark-It color collection permanent marker, Fine Point, Assorted Colors, 36 Markersfor several years for various crafts projects, so I jumped at the opportunity to try out this Ultra Fine point version.First, these are *permanent* markers, intended to compete with the Sharpie fine point markers.

One has solid color cap the other just a band of the color.

I've found every color that I've looked for so far.I can think of any number of ways to use these markers because of the wide range of colors.
