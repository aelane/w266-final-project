Sharpens reliably and writes like a good pencil should. World's best pencil? I love this pencil. It erases easily.Simply the best pencil around... and the only one I use.Great for kids who need to erase! Very happy, even if it is just a pencil. I was a little sceptical about that, I haven'e purchase a pencil for years that could make that claim. This pencil can make that claim and because of that I can recommend this pencil to anyone. They are a very close 2nd to the Black Arrows and will be my pencil of choice unless the Black Arrows come back.

The pencil is made of top of the line cedar wood.

They sharpen SO nicely in a pencil sharpener, which is a GREAT thing if you are a teacher!
