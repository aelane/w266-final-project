This printer gets the job done both as a photo printer and document printer. It can be argued that this helps make sure the printer size is small, but it is clear that Epson can make small front loading printers (as seen with the XP-850). I own the XP-310 Epson printer, not this model. My printer connects easily and I can print off it from my computer or laptop which is a bonus. Seriously great printer for the price. This printer was very easy to setup, comes with proprietary software that makes connecting to the internet and to the online storage solutions it connects to very easily.Whether scanning in black & white or color, this does a great job. So far this printer is fine but I have used it only for printing and copying, not yet for scanning. It was a little harder than my previous printer, an HP All in One, to set up. It is the smallest printer I have ever owned. This printer works with the following OS Windows XP, Vista, 7 & 8 plus MAC OS X 10.5.8-10.8 xThe printer has a 2.5 inch LCD & touch panel which is very nice to work with. This printer does not have an auto feeder for copying  thus you are limited to a single sheet at a time. This printer follows the past couple years of Epson design, but adds a few new features to keep up with new devices and ways to print. I like the printer so far but I fear the ink is going to be expensive. Decent little printer. We purchased this compact printer to serve as an &#34;on the road&#34; business printer. We tried to figure it out...finally gave up and just plugged in the printer cord. What was truly amazing was that, while we were unable to connect with the printer with our Mac computers, another guest in the hotel somehow connected to our printer and printed out her boarding passes. So...the printer works great...if you can figure out how to make it work wirelessly, please let me know. (If you buy this printer, order extra cartridges at the same time to avoid being caught short. For the printer to operate, it must have one black and three colour cartridges, all with acceptable ink levels - otherwise, it goes into a mode of having only non-printing functions. I gather that the printer adds magenta, cyan, and yellow even in grey-scale printing. If you don't have a printer cable, you can still set-up the wireless part manually.The onscreen touch functions are fairly simple and straightforward.There is an SD slot, which is nice, but if you want to make "adjustments" to your photos first, then you're better loading them into your computer first and using your preferred software.Scanning works fine. The printer has several good features (cloud printing, easy Wi-Fi setup, etc. This printer is small so fits in tight places and is great if you don't have a lot of room...actually, it's great even if you do because those giant printers are a pain. This printer has all the bells and whistles of a bigger printer and does just about everything, is a breeze to set up and copies, scans, etc. Such a great printer for $100.00. I bought another printer 2 years ago with 1/2 these features and it cost $200. It's a fully wire-less printer, though. Then I set about putting the printer through a few tests. I did notice the printer was a little slower than my big printer. I'm going to have to give this printer five out of five stars. It's a fine printer and scanner, but the Epson Connect features are what really shine. If you are used to having a printer that automatically prints on two sides without having to manually flip the page over, you are really going to miss it with this printer.- Moderate to slow printing speeds, depending on the document.- Also, the inks that come with the printer are starter sizes that I seem to have blown right through very quickly.If the above points aren't a big deal to you, then you are getting a great deal on a printer that you can send documents to no matter where you are and what device you are using. I recommend this printer to anyone who doesn't require faxing, automatic duplexing, or faster printing speeds. The printer also has an AirPrint compatibility. It's a basic all-in-one printer but there are better Epson options. Physically, the printer is small, as advertized, and lightweight, making it easy to unpack and set up. This little printer is so superior to any other scanner I have used; scans are beautifully sized, trimmed; efficiently sent to Evernote (or any other destination you program). This printer is so simple to use even an untrained monkey could be printing or copying in minutes. Very compact printer, easy to set up. This printer does not feature an auto-duplex capability but two-sided printing can be accomplished with manual intervention.For photo reproduction, the XP410 seems comparable to lower quality prints available from retail sites, which is fine for me as photographic reproduction beyond basic prints is not a priority. If you want a powerful printer (which, apparently, some mistakenly think this is), please look elsewhere and be prepared to spend quite a bit more money. I also knew exactly what I wanted: An inexpensive printer for light household/personal use that was wireless, and could also copy/scan. Especially in a printer that costs under $100. Again, I use my printer infrequently, so not a huge deal. I did not know about the Epson Connect features when I purchased the printer, so that was a VERY pleasant "bonus" that Epson, honestly, did not need to include with a budget-level printer. I recommend you do this (from either the printer menu or the computer software/maintenance). I have a Mac, and this printer works seamlessly with my OSX 10.8.4 (Mountain Lion). It's amazing how good a printer you can get now for under $100. My first printer was an Epson MX80, purchased back in the early 80s (for $500!) I have had the printer for a little more than a week now. This printer should be consider more of a light usage printer and not a high volume home office printer.There are many items to like about the XP-410.The printer has a small footprint, so depending on the size of your desk you will not need a special printer stand.The setup was easy including the Epson connect features.- There is not need connect the printer to your computer to get it on your wireless network. The printer will find your wireless network and just need to use your passcode. I am running WPA2- Even though the printer comes with an install disk, I downloaded the printer software from Epson to ensure I am running the latest. This printer is one of the best I have had. The printer had great printer quality for an ink jet. The printer software was easy to use. I always put my printer across the way. At under 100.00, this printer is a done deal. Unfortunately, I feel like the printer goes through ink pretty quick. You can tuck this little printer amid the stuff on your computer desk- it's made to be small and capable. The printer GUI doesn't make it easy to find. So although I recommend this printer, there are too many good deals out there for just a few more dollars to settle on this one. I bought this printer because it is fairly inexpensive and it is identical to one I have in another location, thus making for painless establishment of wireless compatibility with my family's numerous and varied mobile phones and computers.The wireless operation is very convenient and I don't have to do a lot of color printing, so the fact that this little beast literally slurps up printer ink is not such a big deal for me. Decided to upgrade to a new printer. This is the perfect printer for anyone that does not want to shell out the money for an expensive laser-jet printer. It's also best to locate the printer in an area that will not get bumped as it's pretty light weight and a I've found a small child can push the printer off the table with just a little force.So, for the money, print quality, and design it's definitely 5 star material. A good minimal printer. So to get the most out of this printer, use the correct paper.So I can't say enough about this machine. Epson's C11CC87201 Expression Home XP-410 Wireless Printer, Scanner, and Copier might not be the printer with the most options on the market, but it does have some neat features at a great price.Firstly, the footprint is fantastic. It's your standard printer with black ink and three colors.Wireless functionality is fine. It's an extra printer for me, so I have no complaints. I am so thankful to have this great printer. It was super easy to set up and since it is wireless, i can print without a printer cable. If you get this printer, don't be intimidated by the set up process. The Small-In-One printer offers a scanner, copier, and printer in a sleek design. The printer didn't recognize my router's SSID when I went through the setup wizard, but I think that was more due to my router than the printer. It would be hard to get a better printer in this price range. This is especially useful if your printer is on a shelf below your computer. The printer can be used as a wireless device with Wi-Fi, but it can also be connected to your computer with a USB cable (which is not included).For the money, this printer is definitely a good buy. It's a fine printer for standard home use. First you work on getting the printer. Then the printer eats the ink from the starter cartridges "priming," or something else happens. What this printer has that the other one doesn't have is the ability to print directly from the web, cell phones and other devices. This printer may be small but packs big printer features. The printer features a touch interface with a decent size screen making it easy to setup and use away from a computer. This printer is very quick to respond to print request, printing almost immediately and FAST! The printer also accepts a memory card for printing pictures. The printer comes with a driver disk, and unlike other similar disks that often contain out of date software, this disk downloads the latest drivers directly making the process very smooth. With this printer, it's easy. The printer's test pattern showed that the heads needed cleaning, and I had to go through two rounds before it showed that it was correct. At $138, the printer is far less of a bargain, so I had to deduct a star for that 40% immediate add on.I mentioned the side by side photo I posted, and you have to keep in mind that there are two levels of degradation since it meant printing things out and then scanning them back in. This printer has the minimum pieces to put together and install. The printer takes up less space than my old HP.

Once that was done, the printer's drivers and supporting software "found" the printer on the network and installed automatically from the included disk onto my Windows 7 computer and via downloads from an Internet connection.

The printer was able to recognize the subject and automatically correct the red-eye in the second print.Epson advertises on-line features that allow printing directly from smartphones, tablets and from remote locations via the cloud and/or by assigning a unique email address to the printer and simply emailing photos and documents to the printer.

@highlight

The printer works fine on a modern wireless network or with a direct connection to a Windows or Macintosh computer with a USB cable (not included) but the printer has no CAT-5 network connection nor does it support Bluetooth.
