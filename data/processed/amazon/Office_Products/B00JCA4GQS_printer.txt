The Samsung SL-M2020W/XAA printer is just right for the occasional printing task. It&#8217;s very easy with this Samsung printer.Another aspect I like about this printer is its compact size. If you're considering this printer, it's probably because you are familiar with the differences between laser and inkjet devices. Otherwise, this little printer ships with all the hardware and accessories you need to get started. And the printer's wireless ability on my secured network is quick and dependable. When the printer is not in use, the paper-extenders fold snugly against it, making for an even smaller footprint. I highly recommend the Samsung Xpress SL-M2020W/XAA printer for black and gray shade direct and remote printing. The printer is easy to setup and get working with your phone. This is a wonderful little wireless printer. I have to admit that I was surprised how loud the printer is. The printer is next to my  desk and is very quite.

This printer replaces a 10 year old monochrome laser printer (a Samsung ML-1740) that is much larger and heavier and lacks wireless capability.The footprint of this Samsung, when &#34;closed,&#34; is only 13 x 8 1/2, which is not much larger than an 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of paper.

The printer can then be covered with something to protect it from dust.I set up the printer to work with a Sony Vaio laptop and a HP desktop, and in each case this only took minutes and went without a hitch.

for the printer, compared to nearly twice that for the ML-1740.Highly recommended for anyone in the market for a reasonably priced, good quality, wireless capable monochrome laser printer with a small footprint.
