I specifically wanted a black and white laser printer. If you want a basic laser printer this thing seems like the mack truck of printers. Then finally broke down and got this laser printer based on the review. The Brother laser printer sounds like the fan on your computer; only a little louder. I wish I bought this laser printer years ago. What I can tell you is that though this laser printer comes with a lame starter cartridge, we are very happy with it. Thii is a great laser printer. This laser is one OR the other. Great laser printer that connects with WiFi and will print both sides of a page if desired. My third laser printer and so far my favorite. My last laser printer before this one was a HUGE HP that cost almost a thousand dollars, weighed a ton and couldn't do half of what this ninety-nine dollar printer does.

Additionally, Brother laser printers have the ability to upgrade firmware.

This didn't happen with my old laser printer, or with the new one I eventually got after returning this dud.

I have been using Brother laser printers for years now, and I chose this model to replace my HL-2040 because of the wireless and automatic duplex printing features, although it has other advantages as well.
