The back cover is just cardboard, but it is sturdy enough that you can write with this notebook on your lap or wherever. The cover is strong and won't break off in the first week of class. Great plastic cover and thick cardboard back with quality paper but the best part is the double-side loose paper holder, it makes things so much easier for you. The cover and backing are very sturdy and look like they'd easily survive a college semester. The cover is nice quality and should stand up nicely to heavy use. The cover seems durable and the binding seems strong. Front cover is plastic, back very thick cardboard, and the spiral binding is noticeably tough &#8211; coated vs. wirey. The cover is durable and still looks great after a month of daily use and carrying in my backpack. The back cover is also pretty thick, so the whole thing holds up very well.If you don't have any expectations of this item doing more for you than providing a stable surface on which to take notes, make lists, solving problems of the math variety, or doodle, then you won't be disappointed in this item. The cover is sturdy pliable plastic and there are reinforced pocket pages in the front. The cover is plastic and fairly tough. The cover on this notebook is very strong and sturdy and I don't see it ripping anytime soon (if ever).

The cover is very sturdy and attractive and the spiral binding is well made with ends that are crimped so they don't snag.

The cover is nice quality, the paper decent enough.

The cover is a kind of plastic, making it sturdier and more long lasting than the ones with paper covers.
