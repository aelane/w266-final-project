This is accomplished by lifting up on the back of the seat; you'll hear a clicking noise as you do this. The back and arm rests are adjustable. I found the back to offer more support than the typical mesh chair, especially in the lumbar area. The back ratchets up so you can adjust the level of the lumbar support, but unfortunately for me, the highest setting still didn't feel quite right.The armrests had a surprising amount of adjustment, allowing both their width and height to be move (although surprisingly, not the angle). I wanted the back to have some "give" so I could lean back a bit (and adjust the angle of the back for my body). The back of the chair does allow for adjustment, but the back is rigid and again not comfortable. The back can be adjusted up and down, but it's hard to adjust properly. And if you grab the back of the chair to wheel it around, it's very easy to accidentally change the height when you don't mean to.It's a stiff seat, and it won't accommodate tall people at all.

The back is the same way: firm and minimalist.

The back of the chair can be moved to six heights.

No, the back does not tilt independent of the seat.
