Another use is to simply place a transparent "PostIt" over the passage of interest for easily locating it.The advantage over standard Post-Its it obvious:  since these are transparent, you can actually READ what's underneath your note--no need to move the note aside.They have the added advantage of being easily repositionable and reusable. But I am not clear on what the use is of the huge body portion, though there are probably some specific scenarios when it might be useful.The tinted see-through body portion is 3 by 7 inches, but the length can be reduced to 5, 3, or 1 inch with the perforations (of course you could use scissors to make a custom length). Never use on very thin pages, such as in a bible.You may remove and reuse but each time you do, residue clouds the product. After the 3rd or 4th use, the adhesive is too loose for use and the item too cloudy.All-in-all, a very good product but it has its disadvantages.Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews. It is transparent, but I have no use for that, so I would rather have an old fashioned paper post it. I'd hate to throw them out after one use, like I do the paper kind, but they're useless if the adhesive dies (or if you've written on them!).3. I can't see much use for these.Plastic post it notes? I can't see a use for these in my world or work atthe moment, I seem to have discovered a bit of stationery for which I can'tjustify purchasing or using. I can see these would be of use if you do a lot of in-printediting, at the moment most all of my work is online and only sharedelectronically.I bet if I hang on to these I will devise another off-label use, but at themoment they go into the bottom drawer... while this is a sturdy and well-madeproduct, at some point we have to say, "do we really need more little pieces ofplastic in our lives? (1)  For rapid and convenient use, I prefer Avery's product where all of the stickies have a tab sticking off of the edge. However, I have the most use for the tabbed part (it is great for marking spaces in textbooks that you have to refer to again and again). I don't really find much use for the rectangular parts that you separate from the tabbed part.
