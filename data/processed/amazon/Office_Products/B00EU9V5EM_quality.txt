If, you have been looking for a quality photo printer that will not break the bank,look no further...You have just find it! The quality of the pictures are great. I also print on DVDs and CDs and the quality is outstanding. I'd heard that the quality of printing on this machine is exceptional and far surpasses many of the larger ones made for photo printing.I concur. And the quality was equally as fine.At first it seemed very intuitive when going through set-up until it got to finding my network...then I had to get the book out, which made it a snap. Print quality good on all of them.LEAST FAVORITE FEATURE: the output tray. I love the quality of the prints - both documents and photos. Many AIOs I have tried featured only 2400dpi scanning.The quality of text printing for business documents is very high quality. Considering all it does and the quality  of  the results  I would highly  I would recommend. Again, good quality, quick feeding, no jams.And perhaps the best feature of all, is probably at the bottom of most people's feature lists, is easy on-board wi-fi setup. I like the quality of print and I use a better grade paper, to get better results.

The quality kept getting worse and worse and the ink cartridges are not recognized by the printer.

I'm very impressed with the quality.

Photo quality is quite good and the printer also includes an option for two sided printing.
