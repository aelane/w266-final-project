Though I do recommend using it for the first time outside, as the first time the rollers heat, there is a definite burnt plastic type smell. I didn't time it but I believe the time was faster than four minutes. For a long time, I thought laminators were mostly for crafty people and teachers. It smelled just fine from the first time I used it. Warm-up time is just under 10 mins, and then you can so multiple sheets in a row. From the time I turned it on to when the alarm sounded that it was ready to laminate was 3 minutes and 50 seconds. The first time I heated it up however, I thought it was going to catch fire it smelled so bad. It does seem to take a long time to warm up, but it works well enough and the price is even at full price ($70) it is a good deal with the 50 free sheets. It doesn't happen every time, but often enough it is a hassle and can make things look bad. : )We actually got this to test at a perfect time, it is not that expensive, Swingline is a very reputable brand, and having for my grandson's first year of school made it priceless.He drew the most adorable card for mother's day, and it just had to be laminated, there was no way it could not, btw, I think there is a very special place in heaven for the pre-k teachers that help little hands create masterpieces like the very first mother's day card that he gave to his mommy. Being a first time laminator, I was disappointed that the unit did not come with any laminating sheets, so I had to purchase some which delayed the whole experience. I use that warm up time to prepare items by slipping them into the laminating sleeves. What was a time consuming nightmare should a jam occur, is now solved with one push of a reverse button with this Fusion 5000L.To begin with, no paper sleeves are needed with this laminator.

I have had a terrible time with laminators in the past because they were rarely made well but this one sure is.

The first time I tried this the laminating worked fine except that both papers ended up with a wavy look (as if the paper had gotten wet and then air dried).I tried it a second time, and this time I took greater care in smoothing the papers and pouch (from the closed end to the open end) before insertion into the machine.

It took a long time to heat up and the lamination couldn't be cut or would lose its seal.
