I'm constantly writing in my planner to book appointment for my real estate work. This planner begins August 1 and ends August 5 one year later. I typically use a planner that isn't broken down into hours of the day like this one is, but I do like the format. Realizing it is an Academic planner and not just a regular weekly planner, I can't fault it for not having all of the days of the week in the same format. This is an academic planner designed for the 2011-12 acadaemic year. I find it very convenient that this planner (unlike many others) doesn't cut off the workday at 5 pm. This planner is laid out exactly as shown, with hourly slots. Honestly, it's a planner. This is a useful academic weekly planner that is environmentally friendly as well. I had a planner, but it was smaller and I was keeping tasks separated. In this planner, I can put everything, from my customers' appointments to pending errands.

Overall a very nice planner and I would recommend it.

This isn't a planner that will allow you to make detailed lists of tasks you need to accomplish or record pretty much anything other than appointments.

Still, the planner will be even more useful for people who work in a corporate environment and have many meetings each day.
