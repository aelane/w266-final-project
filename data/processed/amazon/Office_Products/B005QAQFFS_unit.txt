I highly recommend this unit. You just set the main unit into the basket, plug it in, and you're ready to go. I was not sure what to expect from an "Amazon Basics" unit, but they have delivered a fine unit at a fair price. I have only had this unit for a day and my first impression is this is a solid machine. The unit has a small footprint, easily fitting INSIDE the footwell of (under) a desk, but that also means the basket is small, so more frequent emptying is necessary. I am using the unit for personal use. The unit is almost twice as heavy as my 5 year old current shredder. The unit has not jammed or gotten bound up since I purchased it.

The Amazon unit is infinitely better and seems quite solid.The instructions recommend using shredder oil once a month, although a plain vegetable oil may also be used.

Also, the unit must be on the basket properly or the shredder will not work.

This is a solidly built unit, the shredder fits tightly and securely on the bin and it is also an attractive unit.
