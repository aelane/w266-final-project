You can automatically download your cell phone directory, but I don't need or even want all my business contacts on my home phone. You can then choose to call via your cell phone or landline by pressing the appropriate button. A cell phone just can't replace a home phone when it's used this much.I should also mention that we use voicemail, so we haven't really tried out the answering system on this phone at all. I hate talking on a cell phone, and being able to use a landline is just the best.Great phone! Unfortunately, I don't have enough cell phones to try to see if I could "force" the system to allow me to trade-off between two cells but then I can't imagine why it would let me do that. I love being able to leave my cell plugged in and charging by the base station and being able to still receive calls in another room. I just do not use my cell phone very much.The wireless frequency of the handsets does not interfere with most wireless devices, wireless routers, baby monitors, etc. And with the Bluetooth I can register my cell phone so that while it is charging somewhere I can pick up a call using this phone. And you can link it to your cell phone and use this system to answer your cell or to even MAKE calls on your cell from this handset. And it shows up as if you are calling from your cell phone. This allows you to have your cell calls go through the house phone and you don't worry about not hearing your cell phone.You can only receive one call at a time though.the sound quality couldn't be better. She really did not need the cell phone part since she will probably not use it. One can even transfer cell phone numbers to the address book.However, some obviously convenient features are lacking.

Although neither my cell phones (HTC EVO 3D &HTC Rhyme Android Phone) nor myAliph Jawbone II Bluetooth Headsetwere certified, I've been able to connect them to the KX-TG7742S and use almost all of the Bluetooth functions.

From then on, calls coming in on your cell will also ring the various handsets.

You can also call out via your cell (maybe that long-distance plan is better or if it's your work line essentially...).
