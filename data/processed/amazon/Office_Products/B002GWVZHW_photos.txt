I highly doubt I will get as many photos per ink cartridge, but the quality is great, so I cannot complain. I made a few photos for family and they thought I got them developed. I can print photos; envelopes; letters or information, and can scan. I have used it primarily for printing photos, as I think that is an area where this device really shines. You can also connect directly to Snapfish to print out your photos. Once my LG Env3 was paired with this HP, it was easy to print 4x6 photos. The Epson's photos have very deep, rich colors and vibrancy, while the photos from this HP were sometimes not so rich in color depth, and not as vibrant. In some photos (lots of sunlit trees and grass), the differences were very slight. In other photos (for example, photos with a deep blue sky), the differences were more apparent (see the customer images I loaded showing this difference). If good-looking photos is "good enough" for you, then be assured that this printer will print good looking photos. After printing 21 4x6 photos and maybe three dozen sheets of everyday 8x11 (mostly black text and a little color), the yellow and cyan ink cartridges dipped into the "replace me" levels.
