The chisel tips are sufficiently hard that they don't turn to mush quickly and start to draw lines that are three times wider than you want. I found the the chisel tip to allow precise writing whether for think or thicker desired lines. Like the chisel tip design and vibrant colors. And with the chisel tip, you can vary the angle to change the thickness of the line. The chisel tip is quite firm, which helps when you need to use the sharp end to get a fine line.The visible reservoir is a great idea. It has a chisel tip for fine writing or a broader stroke. These have a nice chisel tip that allows for thin or thick lines to be drawn, or to color in designs. These are nice chisel tipped dry erase markers. The chisel tip is decently nice, writes well, ink flow is great! I like the chisel tip as well as the wide tip on these markers. The chisel tip is an angled tip that allowed me to write in either a thin or thick line.One common problem I've had with markers in the past is what I perceive as a horrible smell but these are odor free. The chisel tip is my favorite of the three kinds of tips (bullet, fine and chisel). The chisel seems to hold up the best, for my purposes.The color flows nicely and the shape of the cap keeps them from rolling off the desk onto the floor like the other brands.

The chisel tip allows you to write bold or thin lines.

I like the chisel tip for the large broad strokes needed for students to see in the back of the classroom.

The chisel tip allows for easy writing, and laying it flat is great for drawing boxes around different items.
