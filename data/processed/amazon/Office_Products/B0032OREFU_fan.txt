The fan and heater are of marginal use, the air comes out of only a few holes so you don't get much of an effect. While the fan isn't obviously pouring out a lot of air, in the confined area under the desk, it does circulate the under-desk area air very well.Even so, I found it to be a bit noisier than I like and deducted a star for that. The fan is weak but makes a considerable amount of noise for how small it is, like the fan of old computer PC's. But I wouldn't want a stronger fan since the footrest makes enough noise as it is; I get irritable after a while of hearing it, but that may be because I like silence.If you wear shoes all the time, this footrest will do nothing for you since the air won't reach your feet and the knobby surface won't massage your soles. The fan that is supposed to cool would work but nothing else happened. The fan isn't very strong. Nevertheless, the fan is the problem. The fan isn't cold, but it provides a nice breeze that helps me keep my temperature down.I like the texture of the footrest, it keeps my feet from sliding off and can be used to massage one's feet :) The cord is short, which could be a problem for some people, but a little extension cord should fix that quite nicely. The cool fan air feels nice on my feet but I don't think I would use this in an office besides my own private one. The fan speed does not change, just the overall temperature of the heat blowing. I found it uncomfortable.As for the fan and so on, again I didn't find it useful. It is just a fan lightly blowing up into your feet. it's not a very strong fan, but that is not the biggest issue. since the fan is not too strong, you have to put your feet smack in the middle, which can feel awkward and uncomfortable for long periods. It's not a powerful fan that puts out allot of airflow, it is very minimal... but nonetheless, it is very welcomed.I dare not use the heat feature, as of yet.
