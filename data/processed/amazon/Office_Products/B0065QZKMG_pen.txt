I ended up returning the pen -- it is rather ugly and the writing wasn't enjoyable.However, if you are in the market for a flex nib on the cheap, then this will do. The pen does not write no matter what I try. This pen is my favorite to write with. This pen is something I will have with me for years. The pen is fantastic, no need to go to whaling. I am fine with having to baby a pen, wash it, reset the nib, all of that. Right now, it's stuck I think permanently and honestly I'm about to throw it out.I so wanted to like this pen, but I can't. I can't use a pen where I&#34;m going to have aggravation every time I have to refill it! The pen is perfect sized for me, it is easy and comfortable to grip, the steel nib flexes very nicely, and allows for superb control over the line variation. This pen does not always come out of the box functioning perfectly, so it may or may not require some tinkering.

What i like about the pen is that it is of suitable size and fits well in the hand for general writing.

It's just not fair to compare a $500 pen to a $20 pen.But at the end of the day I need something that will write well and this isn't it.

This pen is great!
