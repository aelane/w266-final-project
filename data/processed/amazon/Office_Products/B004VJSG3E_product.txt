This is another great Avery product that helps us all. I recommend this product. This product works great. I definitely will use this product for my textbooks to preserve book resale value while gleaning the knowledge! What's good about this product is that the arrows are transparent, although they come in bright colors (bright pink and bright yellow),  they have removable light adhesive (it let's you easily remove it without ripping the paper underneath), and they have a writable surface, you can actually use pens, permanent markers and even pencils! What also struck me about this product is it's large size.A good product to have at home, at the office or even at school. They seemed like a wonderful product... at first.After using them for a while, there were three things I found annoying:1)The size - They are huge! This is a pretty neat product. The Avery "Sticky Notes" product line seems to be attempting to cut into Post-it Note's business -- however, it's kind of like RoseArt markers or crayons vs. Crayola -- if you've used them both, you know right away that there's no substitute for Crayola! Nothing overly amazing, but a neat product. This is an amazing product that I will be looking for online and in stores. I found that theirAvery Steps Sticky Noteswere a good product with a different presentation, and the notes themselves held up very favorably to Scotch.This package gives you two colors of a specific sized product for a specific purpose.
