They quickly clean the board without much pressure, and while I don't know how, they seem to make less mess than the standard erasers. My nephew wrote with a Sharpie on a dry-erase board that my children play with, and I've never been able to get rid of the markings. They leave a clean white board and no colored dust. It cleans our board perfect every time. I would definitely recommend this before junking that white board. If you are like me, you inherited your white board at work from many other people. I then took the 3M Whiteboard Eraser and went over the board again. It really does, even 'stains' that have been on the board for a long time.It is easy to use, just dampen with a little water and rub on the board. I wiped the board dry with a piece of paper towel, and the marks were gone. I had purchased white board erasers for our family at a point where I was so ill I could not speak. I tried the old board hanging on our fridge, and a newer one I have in my office. they rock the board clean like nothing i have seen before... no resedue left over and no lines visible after using these they are wonderful almost as good as the mister Clean maybe you guys can combine or get their formula... Our board is kept on a wall so it would be ideal if these had velcro or something similar that could be used to attach to the board so you'll always know where it is. It is a white board eraser. Wow, the white board is now totally clean! HOWEVER, this does NOT restore a tired old worn out white board and we did get out of breath, literally, racing to scrub our halves of the giant board.These erasers are great for the price, and great fun, too.If you do have a board where the coating is just shot - these erasers will clean them, but not restore them. I use a white board outside and sometimes it is hard to get it clean. I plan to try cleaning the whole board with cleaner (when I can) and then trying it as a "fresh start" but for now, I'm not getting good results. After investing in a costly white board on an easel for the farm, a few bucks for the3M Whiteboard Eraser for Permanent Markers and Whiteboards, 5 Inches x 3 Inches x 1.2 Inches, 2 Pads/Pack (581-WBE)to keep it clean will be a small expense when and if we need to repurchase the product. All in all, the board now looks almost as good as it did last year and we look forward to using it again as soon as the farm shares are ready to deliver! And the board looked a little dingy. I used these on a very old, very messed up dry eraser board. Better than the standard white board eraser and easier than the spray cleaner. My white board looks pristine after using it. To wet them for this purpose seems silly because you have to dry the board again.The white portion is very similar to texture of 'magic erasers'. I have a white board that I have used for 30 years. I wiped my board and all but the old marks came right off. open).In summary, this is much better than any other white board eraser that I've come across including those that often come with the markers themselves. A regular magnetic white board eraser works just as well on marks made with dry erase markers--the erasers do need to be cleaned/replaced once in a while. This board is pretty big, 6 foot by 4 foot, attached to my wall. It's not perfect, if you pixel-peep the board up close you'll see some VERY faded writing, but you'd have to look pretty closely. But seriously, if this board came clean, most other will. Just wiping down the board makes it look like the day it was new! It does erase very well and leaves my white board clean...just like the magic eraser that I already have does.My problem with this eraser is that it has no way of sticking to the white board. Traditional white board erasers are attached to a magnet so that they're always right there stuck on the board when you need them. So if you have a white board like mine, that does not have a tray at the bottom to store things like this, you might find it somewhat inconvenient. The board looks great and I cleaned it without using a toxic spray.The only disadvantage is that it does not have a hard cover like my other erasers. This happens also when I use a white board cleaner, so it might be due to my board. It gets the board dirty with the residue dusts. Easy to hold, yet not so small that it takes forever to cover the board to erase. As far as I can tell, if your board is not badly stained, no water is necessary to remove normal dry-erase marks.I reluctantly moved on to test permanent marker, mollifying myself with the knowledge that I can get off most modern permanent marker (the ones that can't make you high) with rubbing alcohol. I've also used it wet to clean up the board when he got a hold of the markers I use to write on DVD's and, again, it cleaned up just fine even though I didn't see it until it was dry. They work well on the white board dry or if the wet if the stain lingered on for a long time. They restored my white board to brand new. It cleaned the board so well that I don't have to use it each time, I can wipe it with a regular eraser and it comes perfectly clean again. I was so excited, I ran to another board to try to find markings ;)  It worked again (and I know those were really old markings). I have a board that had stuff written on it from years ago.

I have a white board in my office for impromptu presentations.

There's a white board around the house which gets used a lot during the school year.

I had tried to clean the board with windex (or another cleaner) and a paper towel, though it left the whiteboard clean, it only stayed that way for a couple of hours.I was very impressed when I first tried one of these sponges.
