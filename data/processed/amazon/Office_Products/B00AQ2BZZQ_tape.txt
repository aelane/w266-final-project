Functionally, this tape can only be used on top of a box. It's not simply a clear tape with which you can tape just about anything even if you originally buy it as packaging tape. no, this tape is specifically designed to be used for sealing boxes with merchandise on it. Put this moderately sticky tape over the seams of your box and then secure the box with clear packing tape. I find this tape a little thin as a sealing tape for heavy boxes. This tape works very well for that. This tape is useful as both a deterrent since it will be obvious if tampered with and as an indicator of potential problems for the receiver.The tape is not meant to be used as shipping tape, but rather in conjunction with standard packing tape. This tape comes in a 300 foot long roll so it's sufficient to package roughly 150 small to medium sized packages. The tape is dark red and gets your attention. The tape seals boxes very well just like all other Scotch packaging tape that I have used. Not all tape is created equal. This tape is very good and I don't have that problem at all. It will not be strong enough to use as tape on its' own. "This tape is printed in red with this message, but again see #1 in that I am able to remove the tape, open package, and realign the tape without problem.3. It fit right in my tape roller, went on easily and sealed my boxes very well. The tape works well, but I usually use a heavier duty packaging tape for added strength. It sticks well enough, but I found I needed to use more tape to seal a package properly. The tape also has an odd smell from the adhesive used. So, the Printed Message Tape is harder to replace than the clear tape and adds another layer of security. The tape is real strong which I love. Perfect tape for packing and shipping. Another great tape from scotch. The actual tape itself is CLEAR with very small red printed font reading &#34;check seal before accepting&#34;. The tape sticks just fine but is a bit thinner than expected. This tape is often mistaken for packing tape, which it is not. This tape is meant to go onto a box/product AFTER it has been packed for shipping. When I first got this tape, I noticed that it was not heavy duty tape. This tape is almost impossible to rip and just stretches. This tape peels off with ease and can be re-applied, leaving no indication that a package was opened. Even when I cut the tape and then reapplied a new layer over the top, you really couldn't tell that I had tampered with the package.I tried this on regular cardboard boxes and also on a mailing envelope. This tape is only moderately sticky and isn't strong enough to safely keep a package sealed. That said, this tape does get the message across. This is a light tape that serves primarily as a warning to recipients to &#34;Check Seal Before Accepting.&#34;  It works well on paper envelopes, leaving evidence of tampering when pulled off if applied properly. Rather, the tape is simply communicating a public service message to check the seal before accepting the package.The tape has a double whammy. Since it is easy to lift the tape up and put it back down without it being evident, a package recipient may glance at the tape see nothing obvious, assume no tampering and accept the shipment. This tape, in my opinion, is intended to alert the recipient of a package that the contents were not tampered with after being sent by the seller. Isn't that what I was trying to prevent?For this tape to work properly, it should be clearly evident that the tape was removed and re-applied. So, this is the tape that you use on top of other tape after you finished packaging up the package. I am confused by this tape. Otherwise, it is pretty standard thin sealing tape that is designed for small mailers. I hoped the tape would work for sealing as well, but this is really more of a &#34;check seal before accepting&#34; marker. This tape is very thin. I put some tape on regular paper and could pull it off without a minimum amount of damage the paper.--Diagonal lines on tape are impossible to realign if package is openedIt was so easy to pull off this tape and reposition it that I have to doubt this claim.SUMMARYI typically buy Scotch tapes. I like this tape because it alerts the recipient to inspect before accepting. This tape would be far more useful if it had higher adhesiveness and more tensile strength. As it is it's a secondary tape. It is important to realize this is not packing tape. Sorry, I'm sure that seemed hyperbolic, but it IS good tape. I really can't rave about it, because it's *just* tape, and honestly, something like tape is either good (it sticks to things) or it's bad (it doesn't stick to things).Well, this is made by Scotch, so you know it's good. So yeah, get this tape. It's almost like masking tape even when applied to some cardboard boxes. This tape is just as pictured, but not as described:"High adhesion and holding power resists popping for a secure seal throughout the supply chain" - is a fully false claim. This tape barely has any adhesion at all. This tape is so weak, that it will actually encourage your employees to steal from you. This tape is worse than nothing at all.----  Edited, and upgraded from 1 star to 3  -----We'd originally given this 1 star, because it didn't stick to the boxes that we use at our facility. Use this tape when you want to guard against tampering and peeking. Meant as a tape for alerting if the package has been tampered with, not used as a packaging tape as it is not very sticky.This is a wide clear tape of about 1.5&#34; with message 'check seal before accepting'. But since it's not, this tape is best used in conjunction with packaging tape. The tape says so. I've seen tape where the printed message stays on the package or the tape comes apart. If you remove the tape completely, it would come down to replacing it with an undamaged piece.
