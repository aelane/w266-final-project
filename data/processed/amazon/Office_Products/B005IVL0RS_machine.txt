I was using the Windows XP embedded in a virtual machine on Windows 7, for anyone interested in the detailed configuration. While it's quite the large machine, it's functionality in printing makes sense for both home or office use.Just like previous Epson printers, if you are thinking about buying this to start your own money counterfeiting ring, it's not going to happen. (2)  This particular machine isn't something you're going to just tuck away. Power the machine on and it will be up and running and ready to print in less that 6 seconds! While the WP 4550 is a sturdy machine, scanning was very slow and glitchy (although of a VERY nice quality). I can happily report, however, that the machine comes with a "full" supply of each of the colors.So far the controls on the printer and the controls on my computer are friendly and easy to understand. The Epson WorkForce 845 Wireless Color Printer is a competitive machine that delivers as described. Leave the machine ON in Auto Receive mode to receive faxes at any time.Printing seems average. It's an all-in-one machine, that does copying, scanning, faxing AND printing: it's INKJET, black and full color (RGB), prints fast and over the wireless network. The machine maintains a chronological fax log, but then that has to be manually matched against the transmitted faxes...an error-prone and time consuming process. It not only locks down the machine until it's finished, it's a time waster.
