I love pens, especially smooth, flowing ones. Two pens came in the package :) I fully intended on sharing one with my co-worker, but once I used it-forget it! I want both pens!!! I was very happy with these pens. I am going to be looking for more of these pens to buy. Can be difficult to find relatively inexpensive pens that write well. These pens write fluidly and they have a nice grip. I take my pens seriously and one pen that passes my tests of quality is BIC Velocity Bold.This pen meets my minimum standards and then some, starting with its thicker lines of ink. These pens are thicker than Medium point. So if you prefer finer tipped pens, I would suggest looking elsewhere. I love pens. I've been using these pens for a few weeks now.Pros:- Grip provides nice comfort.- Writes smoothly. However, the old Erasermate pens had a tendency for the ink to clot a bit and go on the paper in globs when you changed directions with the pen. These pens seem to have the same problem.I played around with the pen and while not as pronounced as the Erasermate pens of 30 years ago, there was still a definite smearing issue with the ink in this pen. Because of this, I've taken to buying my own pens. This is one of those pens that left a bunch of ink marks on my hands. These are very good pens - the grip is good, the ink flows well, the mechanisms work smoothly and relatively quietly.For the most part, the marks they leave are clear and closely follow your intent, however there are occasional "globs" that can mar pages significantly and this problem seems to occur mosly when writing on newspaper stock. I used many Bic pens while in school back in the 60's and as I got older I went to the snobby pens that cost mucho bucks and I am always paranoid about losing them while out & about.Then recently I've gotten several different Bic pens and my opinion of the Bic has done a total 180*.I'm really loving the feel of the Velocity Bic in my hand and the wonderful smooth writing experience of the pen to paper is great.The beauty of this pen is that it feels and writes like one of my expensive pens,but if I lose it,the Bic won't cost me an arm & leg to replace it.For the cost of a refill for the pricey pen,I can buy several of the Bic Velocity pens and they're really great.The gold pens stay home and the Bic Velocity hits the road with me! I tried both of the pens and they are the same.I would have given more stars if it did not bleed. I really want to like these pens because they're comfortable to hold and write very smoothly, but the nib easily gets congested with ink and I can't write for very long without getting inky blotches on the page. I like Bic pens. I found these pens to write smoothly and dry quickly, working well for their chosen task. I'm pretty picky about pens, and these were a pleasant surprise.Compared with normal ballpoints, these pens require less pressure to write, which makes writing smoother and quicker. I feel like these pens give me the best of both worlds.These have replaced thePilot G2 Retractable Gel Ink Roller Ball Pen, Extra Fine Point, Clear Barrel, Black Ink, 12-Count (31002)as my favorite office pens. These are nice pens. I've had these pens for a few days now and I'm really attached to them. Unlike many other - even more expensive - pens, this one writes the first time without skipping.Good pens are important to some people; like me. I usually don't like bold-tipped pens, because the thick tips don't generally accommodate small writing in the margins of books, which I do a lot of. It is definitely better than other pens I have purchased for standard note taking or writing. I can't say I've tested enough pens to confirm the latter, but I can definitely confirm the former.I wrote the same phrase with this pen and with the pen I was using previously (also a Bic Velocity but a 1.0 mm vs. this pen's 1.6 mm ball) next to one another, and there was no contest that this 1.6 Velocity writes bolder/darker AND smoother. It certainly doesn't look too very different than most other pens out there today. You can never have too many pens, right?So I popped le pen out and took it to school with me and...wow, this one was really good! And let's just be real here...I am territorial when it comes to my pens, and this one's so good, I actually have hidden both of them to keep them away from my family! Yeah, I know I'm nuts, but once you try these pens, you're likely to be doing the same thing. But there are other pens out there such as the Pilot G-2 that write just as smoothly without the mess. However, these are not indelible as are the Uni-ball pens, so they cannot be recommended for check writing. I am very particular about my pens. These are nice pens. My other pens (mostly gel uniballs) also smear under those conditions.Anyways, these pens are now on my "approved" list. I ended up giving the pens away.B
