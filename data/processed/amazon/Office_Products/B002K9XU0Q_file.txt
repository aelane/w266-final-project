These file folder labels and plain white. These file folder labels are perfect! Thumbs up on these Post-it file labels! These are standard-size, standard-template file folder labels for 1/3-cut file folders. I tend to keep file folders and re-use them, so I was really hopeful for this product to be good. Well, these file folder labels are just the ticket for that. They are easily removable and fit perfectly over the file folder tabs. Since most of my file labels are 1 or 2 words, I'd have to use a 16 or 18pt font just to fill out the entire label without leaving too much white space. Their file folder labels perform well. They also stuck very solid to the file folders that I had. These removable file folder labels make the tedious quarterly project a snap. We've got many old file folders with otherwise still-usable labels on them. The Post-it file folder labels come in a nice stiff cardboard envelope and Amazon packaging and shipping prevents them from being bent. If you're starting out with new file folders these would work perfect. I didn't get these as file folder labels. Besides labeling file folders, I also label pantry items - jars, plastic containers, cereal, and so forth. At first I thought, "Post-it's for file folder labels, not a good idea, I can't have those falling off. Too often when you want to change your file name or create a new file you have to try to tear the existing one off and leave a mess. And I re-use older file folders if they are still in good shape. Obviously they are made for file folders, but this isn't why I wanted them. When I start a new file folder for a category of papers, I don't always necessarily know how quickly it's going to fill up. It's nice that when I have to upgrade to a larger file size, I can simply pull the label off the old one and restick it. Since they are removable, they make changing file labels a cinch; it's so nice to be able to peel them off, instead of having to put a new label over an old one.These are also designed for both laser and inkjet printers, and they fed just perfectly through my inkjet.As another reviewer mentioned, you can go to 3M/Post-It's website and download a template to use with these, but they are also compatible with an Avery template, which Microsoft Word comes with.The only downside I can see is a problem I have with all labels:  if I only need a few, I don't want to waste an entire page of labels and you're not supposed to run these through your printer more than once.Other than that, these are great! If using on file folders, or a smoother surface (blister packs, glossy book covers, etc), even more. This gives you a .doc file, which I was able to use easily in both Word and OpenOffice. And I really love that these can be removed without damaging my file folders when needed. If I ever have to re-name a file, or no longer need a file, I can't re-use them. I toss them out because writing a file name in pencil doesn't cut it for me, either. I can now easily mark my file folders and not have to worry about it being permanent. Start with a new file and replace it as necessary. These file folder labels are useful and handy. This is just what you'd except: removable file folder labels for 1/3 cut file folders. Although they are marketed are as file folders, they can be used for a variety of purposes. These Post-It are the most expensive file folder labels and the dullest white shade. I use it to cover over old file folder tags but it doesn't work super well. I've been using Avery removable file folder labels for years, with mixed results. Or at least stuck on file folders......... Actually on anything that you would need a label this size for.I don't have a print program that will work for these labels, so I do it all in pen. If you want this to lable file folders this is a good product that does what it is advertised to do, stick and be removed easily. They firmly adhere to the file folder, then when you are ready, they will peel off so that the folder can be nearly re-used.After several uses of a few file folders with these labels, I can say that I highly recommend this product. You can adhere them, then remove them easily and reuse the file folder. I tend to reuse my file folders since the topics for which I use them change monthly or bi-monthly. I use and re-use my file folders and change their labels frequently.W
