This Epson portable scanner draws power from the USB port of the computer via a 60-inch USB 2.0 A-Male to Mini-B cable; no power transformer or cord is necessary.Two software CDs come with the scanner, one for Windows and the other for Apple Mac. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE USER DOES **NOT** CONNECT THE SCANNER TO THE COMPUTER BEFORE OR DURING INSTALLATION OF THE SOFTWARE or the scanner may not work properly. This Epson WorkForce DS-30 portable scanner will not replace a desktop scanner but is a useful mobile accessory to a laptop on travel.Footnote: See my comment below for the link to the user guide, which describes the optional programs in more detail. As I mentioned, my NeatReceipts scanner is 2-3 years old, but the tech fellow told me that the specifications are "similar" to the current model. It is an excellent scanner in a very small, light and portable package. It is somewhat faster than my four-year old Neat scanner on ordinary scanning tasks.I installed all of the software and verified that it all worked with Mac OS 10.7 Lion. Then I hooked up the scanner and I don't know if I got a lemon or what but half the time it does not recognize that there is anything in the scanner but I keep getting a message that the scan is complete and do I want to scan more. I am sincerely hate this little scanner even if it did work right there is very little that it can do. It's well packaged, and inside is the scanner itself, a USB cable with a Velcro strap, a simple carry bag with a drawstring closure, two installation CDs (1 PC and 1 Mac), some calibration and cleaning sheets and a setup guide. This diminutive scanner is decent for general home office use when using it on the Windows 7 PC, and it takes up just a small amount of desk space. That is now wrong, as that scanner has developed issues over time, and my review on that product has also been updated. Now I still have a flatbed scanner but what a pain to lift the lid, position the image, scan it, remove it, etc. This little scanner is great. The scanner comes with a microfiber cover with interior pocket for storage of the usb cable, along with callibration sheets, wet/dry cleaning sheets and installation CD.Express installation from the CD took about 15 minutes . This is the second portable scanner I have owned (the other is a Neat portable scanner that bears a strong superficial resemblance to this one). This scanner seems to be on par with the Neat in both scanning time and image quality. The scanner is so small though, it slides easily into a laptop bag. The DS-30 is a very acceptable portable scanner, and while I definitely prefer my flatbed to it, it works well in a pinch. Now that I have my portable scanner my experience has been almost the same. This is a wonderful scanner! But for me I want a scanner to scan documents. This scanner does everything, AND IN COLOR that those large bulky scanners do.Remember those days when you'd travel and need a scanner, asking the hotel if they had one or looking for a store or friendly business?
