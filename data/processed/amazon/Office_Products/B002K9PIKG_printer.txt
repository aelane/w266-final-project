There was no printer jam, and the alignment was also perfect. You can feed them through a printer, and they ink well. It also seemed to work well in the printer. They fed well in the printer. We have had no printer jams, like we did with Office Depot & Office Max quick lift brands. They feed easily through my printer and have a standard layout so no special template is needed. Once I figured out how to nuance my printer, everything was great. My printer and these labels resulted in a professional job. Because my printer is not great at aligning the pages on which it prints, I frequently end up with text that is not centered on the label -- in fact, it often gets cut at the label's edge. This may be my printer's fault, but I find it easier to use a standard size address label, with margins that are more forgiving of printer error. They fed well into the printer and I didn't have any problems with them jamming or getting stuck. I printed them using a Minolta Color Laser printer, with no problem with feeding or peeling inside the printer.Even though the packaging says that these are laser labels, the paperwork inside mentioned that the labels should work in inkjet printers as well. Occasionally they jam up the printer because of the slight warp. Not sure how long 3M has been making adhesive printer labels, but I just found them and really like them more than the other brand that starts with an A and ends with very.

For the commercial printer, these are great;  and for the person home printer, it depends on the quality of your printer.Handwriting addresses:  I also handwrite addresses in my business (when the printer is down).

These are super easy to use, both in the printer and as just regular labels around the house.

They work great in my HP printer and the matte finish takes ink very well.
