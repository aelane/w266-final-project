Bundled OCR software allows you to scan text documents into editable Word and .pdf formats.Two small things keep this from five stars: printing may be fast, but is also rather noisy...especially when printing text. So, I uninstalled all of the Epson software and ran the process again, except this time I connected the USB cable when I was instructed to do so, and I was able to complete the installation and print WIRELESSLY in about 15 minutes. The software and capabilities are glitchy, then you factor in the inferior quality compared to the Canon, I could in no way say I choose the Epson over the Canon for scanning. I did not have to wait, it was already there.It should be noted that the included Epson software does not work with Mac OSX versions 10.6 (Snow Leopard) or later. I also believe this software let's you type in the wireless key (or uses it from your computer) without having to type it in. I have seen the software package included for Windows to scan with, and it looks a bit outdated, but it seems to work ok.  Would be nice to have something a bit more modern though.Speed. I didn't have to install any extra software to use any of the functions with our Apple or even the PC out in the shop, very pleased with that as I hate the software that some printer manufacturers develop as it rarely ever works correctly.Networking it was a breeze, just selected wireless, choose the correct network since I have two in the house and it saw both along with the neighbors, entered my WEP passcode, and it was ready to rock and roll! So I'm making do for now, until it bothers me enough to fix it or until I'm lucky enough that a software update will fix itself. During the software install process you should also plan to be monitoring your screen as you'll be prompted about allowing access through firewalls as necessary. Once I installed the software on my wife's laptop and set-up wireless, all of my computer are able to see the printer on the network and print to it. After I installed the software on my laptop I had the same functionality minus faxing that my wife enjoys.One of the selling points of the Epson Workforce 635 AIO is of course the ability of a mobile device like an iPad to print to the unit either wirelessly (Epson App).

If they'd send their software developers back into the cave until they returned with a good WYSIWYG web printer driver I'd be more inclined to recommend this.

You will be installing this software on to each computer you want to be able to print wirelessly from the printer.

While it may sound lengthy or complicated, the software makes it a simple and painless process, guiding you carefully through each step.Once the network is set up, printing is just as fast as if it was hard wired in.
