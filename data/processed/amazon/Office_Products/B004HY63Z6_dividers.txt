These colorful dividers make a charming addition to a recipe collection. The actual dividers are of a heavy weight paper but not card stock. Generally, dividers are a little sturdier and are more of a cardboard consistency. All five dividers have different prints on them. Some of the dividers are black or dark brown on one side, with a busy print of very high-contrast shapes on the other, and since the so-called erasable tab is a transparent piece of plastic-type material, how are you supposed to easily read what you've written on the tab? I like the colorful use-again dividers. These dividers are extremely lightweight and clearly not intended for more than an occasional movement. I weighed the dividers and was surprised to see that the entire set of 5 weighs only 1.6 ounces. The dividers are made out of thin paper material that much really isn't heavier weight than standard printer paper. These dividers have pretty bright colors, but they are very thin. These dividers are really pretty and fit nicely into a 3 hole notebook. These dividers are pretty, but are very flimsy. Functionality would have been better served if these dividers had been just a little thicker. These dividers have fun patterns, but they are thin -- almost flimsy. Definitely makes these dividers more useful and no need to worry about the silly slips of papers that inevitably fall out of the older style dividers with which I grew up. I simply adore these dividers that go so well with the binder. These dividers clearly are geared toward form over function and they do have an interesting design. Since the dividers are relatively thin, they do pick up bends in the paper easily from handling. I have these cute dividers in a standard binder that I'm using for some crafty patterns.

These are beautiful, colorful dividers that are erasable.

These dividers are pretty and will add pizazz to a binder- if you can get them in.

For binder dividers they are also quite thin- almost too thin to support the tabs on each one if they have any paper against them.
