The other board has a purple background and it is lined, it has 17 white dotted lines, making it a good candidate for lists (or writing practice). Each board weighs under 5 ounces.The whole back of the boards is a magnetic surface. The dry-erase board is actually about the same size as the original 7 inch Kindle Fire tablet (obviously not as thick).I tried using different colors and types of dry-erase markers on them. Each magnetic board is 5x8 inches with a magnetic surface that covers the entire rear of the board. The second board isn't as useful without a pen.The colors are interesting. Even on the white board, the purple marker shipped is very, very light. You can hardly see it on the purple board, and after a couple of uses the ink is VERY faded. What's the good of a dry-erase board without a dry-erase marker right at hand? Each board is around 4.5 x 7 inches with rounded corners. There is a white board and a lilac/purple one. It could be read easily on the white board, but not so well on the purple one.
