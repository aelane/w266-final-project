I'm also going to connect our cell phones to test out that feature. If you are using cell phone as your only phone and do not have a phone at home, this system can be used in that setup as well. Now if I forget my cell in my purse I can still know that I am getting a call. Both cell phones are relatively new and should be compatible with the Panasonic KX-TG7643M dect 6.0 Link-to-Cell Bluetooth Cordless Phone.Since the main reason I decided to buy the Panasonic KX-TG7643M dect 6.0 Link-to-Cell Bluetooth Cordless Phone over a few other brands I looked at was the stated ability to link it to a bluetooth enabled cell phone and this feature is not working correctly for me with neither of my two bluetooth enabled cell phones, I have to rate this product at no more than 2 stars. Even better, while a cell phone call is being handled with one extension of this system, a completely separate land line call can be made or received by another person on another cordless device on the system. Plus, if you're on a cell phone call using this system, and another call comes in on the land line, you can place your cell phone call on hold and answer the land line without losing the cell call. Downloaded my cell phone contacts in minutes and was on my way. When the cell rings, I pick up the house phone and it is game on! I have not used it but your cell phone can be connected via blue tooth and you will have a 2 line phone (land line plus cellular). The cell feature works great but was driving me crazy so I disabled it. The Panasonic handles 2 cell calls ringing at once without a problem. Yes this works well with the cell phone once you get it set up but if you want to do anything you have to drill down through several layers of menus.

I am looking at replacing cell phones in the next four to six months, so I went ahead and chose the link to cell feature.First off, after owning several different cordless phones in the past twenty plus years, the power for the handsets being supplied by two AAA batteries is a plus.

You can also download your cell phone's contact listing, which I did successfully with little effort.My wife and I both have Palm phones, and I have the system set up to connect to both phones when each of us is home.

Even if you don't use the cell link, you have a great system and that option down the road if you ever need it.UPDATE 2-19-13:It has been a year and a half since I upgraded to this phone system, and it works as well as the day I set it up.
