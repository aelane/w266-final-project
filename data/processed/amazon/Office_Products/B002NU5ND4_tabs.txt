If so, I could use them as tabs in a binder for manuals, etc. These tabs have become my favorite way to do this. These little tabs (notetabs) work very well. I like these tabs. These Avery tabs come in a lot of variations: bright colors, pastel colors, different shapes and lengths. Like all the other tabs in this line, they are nice and stiff and the sticky part will not wear out before the rest of it. These rounded tabs take up less space (outside the page) than Avery's conventionally-shaped index-style NoteTabsAvery NoteTabs, 2 x 1.5 Inches, Neon Blue and Magenta, 40 per pack (16293).A real winner; highly recommended! I found these tabs to be very handy when it comes to my work related filing system. These are actually really great tabs. (I positioned, peeled, and re-positioned the tabs on a few books and used them to index a card file, just to make sure.) I really liked these tabs. These handy tabs are great for organizing your books, reports, or any other medium that will hold a tab for later quick reference. The tabs can be removed without damage to the paper, and will re-stick to another surface.Excellent product. I love these little tabs. Avery NoteTabs stylishly and sturdily replace flimsy tabs, no-longer-sticky sticky notes, and dog earred bits of paper and index cards.I used these in my moleskine to more effectively divide my notebook up into usable, more functional, and more organized resource.The NoteTabs have a more permanent feel than any other solutions I have tried- the plastic is stiff and has a pleasant lightly textured feel. They're note tabs. These are very nice tabs -- easy to use, easy to find, easy to flip, just the right kind of tab for marking pages in a book or notebook. These little tabs are decent--they're very durable and they come in many different colors. These Avery tabs are still a good product, though! Okay, so it's hard to get excited about sticky tabs, but those of us who need to quickly access pages in a long hardcopy document will appreciate both the durability and the non-permanent adhesive strength. The best new is that they stick and stay where you place them.Post-It tabs are much more flimsy than these. I am unable to remove the tabs without ripping the paper.4) The tabs are curved, resembling a half circle or half moon. I recommend using these rounded tabs for textbooks, bibles (see number five), and the like. Other flimsy tabs don't measure up to the quality of these AVERY labels; I highly recommend them for all your organizational projects. These tabs are nice to use when you don't want to add the full-page tabs to something, or when that's not possible like for books. These Avery tabs are fantastic! The tabs are semi-circular in shape and are approximately 1-1/2 inches across and 1/2 inch tall. These tabs are perfect, bearing the weight of my heavy, thick binders and hardcover reference books easily.The yellow and green tab tops are colorful and rounded, which makes the tabs fun to use. The thick tabs pull off easily without ripping the pages, and their 'sticky' keeps sticky enough for plenty of use.Avery did a wonderful engineering job with these thoughtful, attractive note tabs. These little tabs are awesome! The rectangular tabs, which I use for chapter headings, comes in a package that contains more tabs, so I would need to buy more of this type, a bit of a disadvantage. These tabs are made of sturdier material and will probably last longer from the wear & tear standpoint. I use these tabs to keep my spot in a book, especially my knitting books. These tabs are fantastic. These tabs are an innovation. I like tabs and have several kinds. If you like tabs, you will probably like these! I used these tabs to mark chapters in my pharmacy tech textbook and they worked perfectly. These little tabs are very handy. You can use them as tabs on dividers in a binders or on file folders; however, the best use is in books. These tabs are great. I have used Avery self stick tabs in the past. These particular tabs are thick, heavy duty, and have great adhesion. The tabs don't damage the ink from pages while the clear sticky part allows you to see the wording. The repositionable tabs can even be highlighted. This little tabs were perfect for re-labelling my planner, and the different colors make it easy to mark important upcoming events. They truly are repositionable - I was getting tired and put 2 tabs on October, and it was a cinch to unpeel it and place the label on another page. Overall, I would definitely recommend these tabs! These tabs are great for marking chapters in a book or frequently used pages.What I like:1. they are heavy duty2. Very quickly, the tabs lose their adhesive power.Some paperbacks have higher quality paper. On those, the tabs last longer and pick up much less ink and paper.I like the clear plastic lower half of the tabs, which means I could place the tabs anywhere on the page without obstructing the text. They stand out from all the other tabs that I have used or have seen when looking for office supplies. The tabs can be easily removed with out tearing book pages. These little tabs are just as handy as the larger ones, but they are useful for situations where more tabs are needed with less information written on them. I can put tabs to my favorite and most used recipes without damaging the pages. Unlike other tabs that tend to be designed for specific purposes, these are limited only by your own needs and imagination. These are tabs are great! The tabs are attractive, unobtrusive, have a small adhesive footprint (esp. when compared to the Avery 3X3 1/2" tabs), adhere well to paper, remove easily and neatly and would make fine dividers or tabs if you were just marking pages (like tabbing recipes you want to try in a cookbook) without adding any identification to the tab. While the Avery 3X3 1/2" tabs have more writing surface, they also have quadruple the adhesive footprint of these 2/x1 1/5" tabs, so I actually would prefer these smaller ones for some applications. These little tabs make me happy because they are fun, colorful, and really help keep me organized. These little sticky tabs are great - and fun to use! I wrote on the tabs with a ball point pen before pulling it off the pad and the ink stayed very well - no smudges, no transferring to my fingers.I only wish that 1)they came in more colors in one package. Love these little sticky tabs! These sticky tabs are basically what you would expect, although they are pretty big. They aren't flimsy and flexible like the tabs I've had before and I'm undecided on how often I'll use them. You can write on the tabs, which is a nice feature.Overall, these tabs are extremely good quality and durable; I'm just not sure what I will use them for. * tabs are durable and hold up to use well - I am using them on textbooks to flip between sections and it has been working very well. These little tabs are great. I've been using these tabs to create dividers in my textbooks.They are great and very useful when the pages of your books are not highlight or notetaking friendly.They come off easily in my most delicate textbooks without damaging the pages, so you can sell your book back at the end of the semester without a problem.Nice colors, great size, very useful.The price could be lower, however.For the same price, you can use el cheapo post it notes. These tabs are for you! These are really great tabs. The tabs themselves are nice and thick. These are easy to use, removeable replaceable tabs.O
