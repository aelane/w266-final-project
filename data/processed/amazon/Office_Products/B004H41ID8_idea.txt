The idea of cutting down on my desktop clutter is simply amazing. another great idea from post it. The idea here is to have an organizing system that you can move around as needed - in this case, clear plastic pockets for sorting bills, papers and other everyday items.There are three pieces in the package in three sizes. This is a neat idea to keep papers and receipts organized at home or the office. I do like the idea that I can remove them with out leaving sticky behind. Leave it Post-It to come up with another great idea! (the idea crossed my mind to keep one in the bedroom next to the bed .... but I thought the better of it) I loved the idea of these Post-It Pockets...  My life is held together with sticky notes, so the ability to have pockets to stash more info, wherever I need it, was wonderful...

These are a pretty neat idea, but they don't hold enough.

These are a good idea and tried using them on the wall but as soon as you put a few things in them they fall off the wall, the sticky tape just doesn't hold well enough.

Such a good idea but just not quite what I was hoping for.
