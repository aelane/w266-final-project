I highly recommend this product. This is an incredibly boring product - I can't imagine anyone getting excited about some assorted color file folder labels.But if you're the type of person that buys/uses these things, it's something along the lines of "why didn't we have them like this years ago?" This product seems so simple that it should have been thought of before. This product provides the simpler solution, a small pad of labels you can grab and write on as you create that new folder. A great organizational product from a great company! This product is good for color coding files. I would recommend this product for a more effective filing system. I am very pleased with this product. These are a nice product, with really bright (maybe a better word is "deep") color coding along the top -- blue, red, green, or yellow -- to help separate and group files the way you want. This is a handy product if you frequently re-use manila file folders (and therefore need to relabel them). This product is similar in size to a pad of Post-It notes, so it can sit nicely on your desk without taking up much space. Nice product--highly recommended!!
