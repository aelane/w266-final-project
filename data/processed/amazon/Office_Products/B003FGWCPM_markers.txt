I really liked the Bic Great Erase Grip markers and even put them to the sniff test, testing them against a competitor to see which one smelled more. These BIC Dry Erase markers are fantastic - much better than the standard fare markers. These are his favorite markers, especially the blue one. We are very satisfied with these markers. We use  markers to make notes on 8.5" x 11" laminated sheets, and this type of tip does a neater job than standard tipped versions. These dry-erase markers are really nice! What else can I say, except that these markers do what they're meant to do? Bic claims these markers are low in odor, but they actually emit a chemical/alcohol smell that is quite unpleasant at close range.Bic Great Erase Pocket Style Dry Erase Markers carry a fair price tag and they represent a decent overall value. I have dropped my markers when writing on the board several times because the pen is so slick, the new comfortable grip is a great improvement.I also like the these markers are low odor. Those EXPO markers fill my bin at work. I've had cheap, colored "China" markers (with which you can write on a whiteboard or glass) last for YEARS without drying out because they're not liquid to begin with -- and I also have a set of dry erase Crayolas that are larger and do the same thing. Overall, I'm pretty pleased with these BIC markers. I had some older markers that the kids used and the smell of them just about knocked me over. But these markers have little to no smell to them. These Great Erase Grip markers are advertised as having a fine tip, but I'd say it is more of a medium tip. These markers come to you in stark and bold colors.They erase with ease and have a low odor formula.Versatile, they may be used in home or school.Look for these Bic markers soon, September is back to school.Jay Adler, Music Critic. If that is you, then these markers are not for you. I wouldn't even consider these if I were to purchase fine tipped markers in the future.One other thing- I did a quick test of each color side-by-side to test how easily they erase over time. These markers do not have a strong odor and they do not foul the air in a room after they have been used. My normal markers for white board use are "Expo" brand. I thought these markers would be good to use on a dry-erase board we have for keeping track of tournament winners. The markers all went on quite smoothly and erased easily. The markers are advertised as Low Odor. These markers stand up well to abuse and lasts for a month easily. I like to buy my own markers now and then to try different brands. I like these BIC markers quite a bit and my students do also.The colors are vivid; the points are sharp; the marks erase easily with a swipe of the eraser. These markers have a nice gripping surface where one holds the pen in his or her fingers.
