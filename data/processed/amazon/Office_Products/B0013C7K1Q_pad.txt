Width-wise the pad is fine however. I use this pad in my classroom. I mainly use the pad with the computer that operates my whiteboard but I move it to the desktop that is at my desk when I have more extensive computer work to complete. Perfect pad, sticky on the bottom and slick on top. I hope that the pad makes my arms less sore. The pad itself is on the small/narrow side, but my optical mouse tracks very well on it. The pad is smooth so the mouse moves easily without any hesitation. The pad has a sticky underside that keeps it from moving on the table, but not sticky such that it leaves a sticky feeling on your fingers if handled. This pad is 'portrait' (about 6.75" x 6.75") as compared to the 'landscape' (about 9" x 7.5") version I have used for ages. That also reduces the pad space to be utilized. I can use this pad comfortably if I turn it sideways, not using the wrist rest (pointless). The pad's plastic surface may hold up better than the faux-textured surfaces that wear down on other mouse pads I've used. I have been using this pad with gel rest for four days now and I am loving it. The pad itself has an easy glide top that enables my mouse pad to go from one side of my 20" screen to the other side of my second 20" screen by only moving the mouse about an inch. I've been using this pad for a couple of weeks and so far it has been very comfortable. The pad stays firmly in place, and seems like it will stand the test of time with its durability. Pretty pad and nice idea. The pad facilitates smooth, accurate mouse movement. They seem to pop right off the pad. The pad size is smaller than my old mouse pad, and I found that since I use a larger mouse, the gel rest can get in the way. I do not find this pad's wrist rest too hot, and it does not cause sweat to build up on the underside of my wrist.Finally.
