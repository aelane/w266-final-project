It can take several sheets at a time, provides a secure cross cut and holds several months worth of shreddings in the bin.It has a lot of safety features built in which I guess is good for most people but we dont have kids and they have prevented me from easily unjamming it a few times.Overall, we are very happy with it and it should last quite awhile. It will adequately shredd up to about 10 sheets fairly quickly. Better that you use 5 or 6 sheets at a time. It works very good if you don't try to force extra sheets. It does cross cut sheets and that is good when trying to competley destroy pages. It will shred five or more sheets of paper with ease. If shredding more than 5 or 6 sheets of paper at a time or a cd/dvd, it really lugs down. Told her I wouldn't recommend doing 11 sheets all the time as that's hard on the motor.......and told her NEVER to put in paper that have stickey stuff on them, like those &#34;return&#34; stickers or even envelope with the self stick stamps on them. it shreds through multiple sheets of paper, doesn't short out, and works great. Feed the sheets top to bottom, not sideways, for more secure shredding. It was fairly priced and seems to gobble up at least 4-5 sheets of paper with hardly a groan. It shreds sheets of papers in minutes.

It looks like tiny rectangular sheets and leaves documents in such a confetti-mess that it would be a nightmare to have to piece it back together again.Overall the performance is 5 stars!

Else, like my current Fellowes Shredder, it works well, handles 8 sheets (it's rated at 11, but at 8 sheets, the motor sounds like it was struggling).

I fed it 1 then 2 up to 11 sheets and it will do 11 sheets but slower.
