The printer goes through ink like there is no tomorrow. According to 2230 printer, all 3 of these "empty" cartridges have about 25% toner left. However, 2240 showed them all as COMPLETELY empty.Is this printer "too sensitive" or just too greedy? I've had this printer for a month and it's been great. I love this little printer. The printer tray is on the inside, which is part of why it can save so much space, and I have never once had problems with the paper jamming like I have with ink jet printers.As for the quality of the printing, even when printing things with pictures on it, it prints quickly and it prints quite high quality as well. This printer runs very loud and can become irritating during large print jobs.Perhaps the most significant and important detail regarding the HL2240 is the fact that it is NEITHER a wireless printer NOR a network-ready printer (There is *NO* WiFi connectivity or CAT-6/CAT-5 network cable connectivity port). While you can hook the printer up via USB and set up network sharing for the device through Windows 7, the printer must maintain a physical hard-wired connection to a USB port in order to be online and ready to use.In summary: I would suggest considering a more full-featured monochrome, particularly one which has the versatility of wireless or LAN connectivity options. Recently purchased this printer through Amazon's Gold Box offer. The printer came with instructions, an installation disc, a power cord and a starter toner cartridge. Then, after shutting the printer off, you insert the installation CD, select your particular printer, and proceed by connecting the USB cable to the printer then the computer (if that is the type of setup you choose).

I suggest that you buy that printer instead.

That printer is constantly on sale.
