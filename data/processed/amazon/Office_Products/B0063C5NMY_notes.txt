I really can never have enough Post-It notes. These are the same sticky notes you know and love, just a lot more than the standard yellow pack you may be used to seeing - and in a nicer looking design! They're so helpful for jotting down notes in a hurry and not automatically losing them.I especially loved these fruit design post-its. If you're like me and have to leave notes for yourself to remind you of things, this is great way to stock up on Post-It notes. These post-it notes are simply beautiful. Post-it notes are enormously helpful items to have in any office, and it's amazing that they've only been around for a short period of time! Post-it notes can definitely function well in many systems. These are designer post-it notes in various colors, I got green apple, strawberry and orange. (I once bought no-name non-3M sticky notes to save a few bucks, and those were not sticky... lesson learned, I need to stay with 3M Post-It Notes. I have to say that I love these post-it notes. I always use post-it notes and have to say that I think it's great to have a cube of them instead of running around finding another pad within a week of use. The notes stick well, no peeling off within a minute of being placed on something.The cube has pictures of fruit on the sides which, if you were looking for something fashionable, then you would like this. These are great little notes, slightly smaller than their normal yellow cousins (yes, I did measure them because I happened to have a square of yellow notes laying around and noticed the difference). And, the notes are correspondingly colored:  a pastel green, a pale pink & a vibrant orange (the orange ones really grab your attention!). I use electronic "post-it" notes to keep track of all sorts of information, but for everyday temporary reminders and notes from phone calls, we need the physical post-it notes and a pencil. And for me, these are all about the notes and my notes/tasks sometimes stick around for a long time. It does make these notes smaller - and cuter - than the normal size.If the side graphic isn't that important, consider theAvery Perforated Sticky Notes, 3 x 3 Inches, Citrus Colors, 450 Sheets (22599)

And since I always need Post-it notes (who doesn't?

3M makes Post-it notes in tiny 1-7/8" square cubes, and they have a rainbow of colors, which I do not "find" (no pun intended) as nice as a solid one color cube.These are adorable, normal size 3" x 3" pad cubes (300 each in 3 "flavors") with bright colors on the sides which are rendered in photographic-like quality.

These post-it notes are of the same high quality as the regular post-it notes and do come in these different colors.
