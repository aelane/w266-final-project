As with other all-in-one printers, it can fax, scan, copy, and connect to a network via Ethernet or Wi-Fi. These new printers find the network and connect to much faster. I've had double sided printers in the past that just mangle half of every paper I try and print out. Laser printers are fine, except that they are expensive, both with the hardware and the cost per page to print. Laser printers use quite a bit of electricity. As with many other Epson printers, the WF-7620 offers duplex printing, allowing you to save on paper.Scanning is just as expected, though you cannot scan wirelessly from the printer &#8211; you must initiate scanning on the computer. All in all the WF-7620 is comparably easy to set up as all the Epson Workforce printers. Other than that, the printers are identical. I've had a few printers suffer scanning damage during shipment. Not only is that counter-intuitive compared to most 11x17 format printers I've ever used (and presumably somewhat slower) but it means that paper hangs out further when using the manual document feeder.Since the 11x17 was the main reason for wanting this, most of the other features are somewhat less significant to review, since they're relatively standard. I scan to dropbox.- Software allows multiple printers to be setup and used- Software checks for update and can update the printer firmware- The scanner is a lot faster than my Epson 630 from a couple of years ago.- Double sided printing is smooth and easy. I've used many printers and this one is pretty fast.Quality - Everything that I've printed so far looks amazing. I should report that I'm very familiar with and have reviewed more than a few printers, other than Epson, without experiencing an iota of trouble.I'll update this review if and when a circumstance changes.
