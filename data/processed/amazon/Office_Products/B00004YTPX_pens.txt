36 pens with 2-day Amazon Prime delivery? They normal everyday pens. BIC pens are pretty reliable for taking orders and are cheap enough they don't mind putting them down with credit card receipts. Used to purchase pens from costco and sams club but they wouldn't write on paper when written on top of glass. these bic pens always work the best and the blue was just cheaper but is more vibrant color so works out well when signing paperwork I think we've all used these pens for thousands of years, or so it seems! What can one say about these pens? They're about the most basic pens imaginable. I have really gotten tired of purchasing pens that run out of ink, with very little use. I would recommend these pens to anyone who journals, does a lot of writing, or simply needs a pen that is Reliable and great to use! Good pens and the price is right. These BICs are my favorite pens to use, even if they aren't too fancy. Not as good as the Cristal pens, but decent. The Cristal pens have a wider point or something, even though these are both labeled as medium points.
