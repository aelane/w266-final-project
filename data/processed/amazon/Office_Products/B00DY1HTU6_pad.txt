This Logitech pad rivals them. The pad seems well constructed. And the pad seems solid -- I had to replace the X-Trac Pro HS pad after a year when the surface started separating from the foam rubber backing. Mouse pad will stay where you put it. I sure was concerned when I first put the pad to work, watching the mouse slide around like that one time my Chevy S-10 fishtailed on black ice on the Terwilliger Curves in Portland. Until this pad, I didn&#8217;t realize how much effort I was exerting to shove mice across my desktop. While the pad is study enough to put stuff on it without leaving deep marks or embedding crud, I feel it tends to demarcate this big black area as The Mouse Zone.Recently, I&#8217;ve begun to store my AV reciever remote on the unused real estate. That said, you get a great pad with lots of room to move with precision. The pad looks great and should be easy to clean, if needed. Sometimes, maybe a little too much.The pad is also large, so you'll need enough room on your desk to use it.Overall, it's a nice pad for someone that feels a cloth pad just isn't smooth enough for them. However after trying this Logitech pad, I realized there is still a market for very good ones. This pad is of a similar, and in some ways I think better, build quality but it's missing that wrist rest which I think is a must, even if it does push the price higher than it stands today.

The SteelSeries pad, relative to this pad, is much larger, more padded, costs less, and does not generate as much noise when I move my mouse over the top of it.

If I wasn't used to the SteelSeries pad, I honestly would love the build quality and extra surface area on this pad.The tracking on this pad is more than fine for my usage, and I have no complaints about that.

That gaming pad lasted longer than any generic mouse pad I had used previously and was, in my opinion, well worth the investment.
