This Pilot MR Animal Collection fountain pen is a real bargain; the other fountain pens I've used that are this nice have cost several times as much. Thus far, I have turned six fountain pens, so my sample size is limited. I do own several other fountain pens and think this falls in the middle in terms of performance and construction.The cap is postable and, when capped, the pen has a good feel and balance. Writing with the Pilot fountain pen is like going back in time but without the ink mess on everything. I don't have many other fountain pens to compare this one to, but it's equally as elegant as the one I bought in an English gift shop and is certainly classier in appearance than my Bics. This fountain pen looks simple, stylish and elegant and it's a pleasure to write with. It writes well, though I have to say the fountain pen style is a bit scratchy for writing any long letters or paragraphs. I personally have been using fountain pens since I learned to write and have several of assorted price ranges and ages. I write with fountain pens often, so a chance to try out a Pilot version was welcome. Many fountain pens traditionally do, and I have a slight fear when storing a fountain pen with only a snap that it will not stay in place and that the nib may fall out and bend (very easy to do if it drops even a small distance) or that ink may stain a shirt.On the whole, I recommend this pen. A very, very nice fountain pen. I hadn't used a fountain pen since the 70's! This is the second Pilot fountain pen I've reviewed - and like the first one, the PILOT MR ANIMAL COLLECTION pen comes without instructions of any kind. I still contend that the fountain pens I used as a child were much, much easier to load. I love to write with a fountain pen, but too many, in my experience, rasp across the paper giving the script an uneven appearance. I own several fountain pens and have used them for years, but to be honest, I'm more likely to pick upthis Pilot disposable fountain penthan a Waterman or a Lamy. If you've never owned a fountain pen before, you should know that this is generally not a good idea. )I am enjoying using the Pilot MR fountain pen. It was like ordering a fountain pen that was pink... you just don't do it. I've already tossed out or given away my other fountain pens after using this one.This pen is very classy in appearance and would be sure to make a good impression at meetings or seen on your desk.
