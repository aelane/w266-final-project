I can store pens and important bills that aren't due for a while, like property tax bills that show up months before they're due. I love that I'm not always looking for pens because I can store them high and away from kids. However, they are sufficient to store a few pens, pencils, notes, or recipes. We've had some pens and pencils on top of the fridge that sometimes roll off when we open and close the door, and this will take care of that annoyance.It has four very strong magnets on the back. I'm using it for pens and a calculator, but it holds strongly enough that I wouldn't be afraid to use it for things like small scissors or screwdrivers. I got one of these to hold pens and notepads on my fridge. I mostly use it for storing/keeping pens and note cards, although, at work, I slide a highlighter inside.The pocket divider has two sections on the left-hand side (facing the divider) where one can store about three average (not thick/large) sized pens in each section, or, one average-sized highlighter and two regular-sized pens in each side&#8230;though they will fit rather snugly. I tend to keep two pens in each and/or one highlighter and three pens, maybe a pencil, though, I tend to have my pencil on my desk or behind my ear.In any case, while I&#8217;ve not experienced using this for a locker &#8211; for a high school student, or in a work setting where I am assigned a tall locker &#8211; for, I perceive this to not be the most convenient for a square locker (especially if it is a &#8220;ground level&#8221;/low locker) &#8211; I don&#8217;t foresee this pocket holder as being &#8220;un-useful.&#8221; I would, though, perceive the use of it in a locker setting to be slightly different than that of an office-oriented environment or home environment.I highly recommend this product to/for anyone, really. This means that it's fine for pens, small pads of memo paper or a cell phone. It holds pens and business cards fine. We seem to always be scrambling around for pens and for something to write on. -Where do all the pens go? I squeezed four pens in and one Post-It note pad (3 x 5).
