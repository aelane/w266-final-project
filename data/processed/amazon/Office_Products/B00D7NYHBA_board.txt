I now use this board to track items I need to remember to get at the grocery store.I also use it to track chores that still need doing. Very handy little board. This board came with a dent in the top due to the packaging. It's also nice that the board is magnetic. The Quartet Magnetic Combination board is a good low budget board that just need a little care. It will almost certainly require repainting when the board is removed from the wall. While we haven't tried it yet, the board might also provide a surface for some magnetic poetry... the sky could be the limit! It's hard anymore to find a white board that's actually magnetic. I also like the corked board on the bottom. I like the white board area too and the pen with magnetic cover. I'm even happier with this Quarter board than I was with the previous Quarter white board that I ordered.
