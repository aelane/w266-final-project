But for me, I love this wrist rest! And unlike wrist rests that are made of foam or covered with fabric, the leatherette cover also is very easy to clean; I can simply wash it with soap and water under the faucet and quickly dry it off. My wrist and forearm move too much when I use my mouse, and the wrist does not slide easily over the gel. I am a wrist rest convert. Overall , I am extremely happy with this wrist rest. This wrist rest is the right size for most standard keyboard and very comfortable. This wrist rest works well for those who don't use a mouse pad but need something to rest your hand when moving back and forth in active data entry.

I bought this to replace a gel wrist wrest which came with a 4 year old Dell high end portable (too big to call a laptop) which I liked quite a bit, but which was coming apart at the seams. So, I got one, and it does NOT feel like a gel wrist support. I will probably give this one away, or use it as a wrist wrest for my portable laptop. This is a quality wrist rest and I owned this along with the matching 3M mouse pad (which also includes a wrist rest). Unlike other wrist rests that I've used in the past, all of which were office issued/brand name unknown, have been gel type rests as well however; they had a tendency to peel/crack as well as leak or leave a sticky residue. This wrist rest is exactly what I needed at the office! I've been using gel wrist rests with my computer for years, having long ago noticed the difference it makes when working for extended periods of time with or without such support... and the 3M Gel Wrist Rest's sleek surface material, solid support, and optimal size make it the perfect wrist rest for me.I love the way the 3M Gel Wrist Rest is non-porous, unlike other wrist rests, since it's more likely to age well without the typical degradation and dirtiness of most other wrist rests. This old wrist rest (yes, it's also a tongue twister) had signs of where my skin rested on the surface, I guess it is just dead skin cells that just kept being scratched off and piling up. I have happily tossed my old wrist rest in the recycling bin and am much happier with the way my desk looks. I've tried a few mousepad-sized wrist rests, but they've either irritated my skin, or felt so mushy that they didn't provide any support. The wrist rest is great. This gel wrist rest pad is exactly what I needed for occasional PC gaming. Until this 3M wrist rest arrived, I was using a Lycra-covered gel support from Staples that was much softer. I originally started using this gel wrist rest with my Mac Magic Trackpad and this really was not optimal as the wrist rest raised my hand and fingers higher than they needed to be to take advantage of the proper motions needed to take best advantage of the trackpad. I like this one because I can rest my wrist on it, and not feel it sinking into the material. I'd recommend this if you'd like only one wrist rest for your desk. I had previous received and reviewed a similar wrist guard from 3M. This wrist pad allows me to type for longer periods of time without experiencing pain.I Like the product.In Him, Dr. Carl It is comfy and makes an excellent wrist rest. This is the perfect wrist rest. This wrist rest fits the bill. This is a gel wrist rest that slides at the bottom of the standard PC keyboard. The 3M Gel Wrist Rest (WR340LE) is an outstanding wrist rest. Other gel wrist rests I've used became malformed after a short period of use. If you are used to working without a wrist rest the lower height might be preferable. I was thrilled to receive this wrist rest... it has saved me from the constant pain I was getting in my wrist from working on my computer for hours on end. This gel wrist rest looks and feels solid, and unlike a lot of wrist rests out there, it does not stink! If you don't type much, then it can be a good wrist rest to have. This wrist rest is very comfortable and of good quality, but I found it too low. I've used a few wrist pads for the keyboard in the past and have had fairly good experiences with 'em.

It is so ergonomically designed to give you comfort I have not felt from using those ordinary wrist implements I used in the office. I really like this wrist rest. This wrist rest has good size and weight. I've tried many wrist rests and they were either not sufficient height or shoddily built and didn't last very long. This 3M gel-filled wrist rest is the ideal length (18 inches) for most standard desktop keyboards. Long enough to give you the wrist rest for your full sized keyboard and your mouse too. I switched from my previous wrist rest (3M Office Gel Wrist Rest for Keyboards) to this one for a few weeks and my wrists and fingers had never been in so much pain.I am on the computer for 8-9 hours a day during the week. I had to switch back to my old wrist rest.If you prefer a firmer rest wrist, then give this one a try.

It does alleviate wrist pain when you've been sitting with your wrists at the edge of a desk for hours. This wrist rest is incredibly well made. They try to combine the wrist rest for the mouse and the wrist rest for the keyboard together into one unit. I prefer a wrist rest that is attached too the desk or a keyboard drawer so it cannot  fall and a separate mouse pad wrist rest.Still, this product has a great feel and the perfect softness. This wrist rest is a great size for work with a desktop mouse. It supports the wrist without any pressure points. I first centered the wrist rest with the keyboard, and it was getting in the way of my mouse reach. The wrist rest is attractive and can be safely washed and it is nice and heavy. And the wrist rest itself couldn't be more comfortable, providing just the right amount of firmness and support with enough soft "give" to make typing with my wrists resting on it SO much more comfortable an experience!Honestly, I had no idea that I needed one of these, and now that I have it, I LOVE it! Before I knew it, my wrist was all sweaty which wasn't the most pleasant feeling in the world. This wrist rest is fantastic for kitting, to put under elbows (instead of the wrist). I don't think this wrist rest was designed to be used by most men. This large, cushy wrist wrest is well suited for my old-school Apple keyboard, which is on a keyboard shelf rather than desk height. I've been using this wrist rest for about a month now and I'm pretty happy with it. It does give some when my wrist is resting on it, and it doesn't cause any pain but it's just not as comfortable as I had hoped. I hesitantly took this gel wrist rest, because I have never had luck with gel wrist rests. I recommend this wrist rest for your wrist comfort! This is more convenient, but also more awkward when trying to adjust the wrist rest for more comfort. This is a gel wrist rest, which normally is pretty comfortable, but on this particular one is pretty hard. Still, I'll keep using this 3M gel wrist rest unless I come across a super duper wrist rest for my mouse hand.I haven't had any problems with the leatherette... should any longevity issues arise, I'll update this review. My wrist normally starts to hurt after about an hour without support.

It was scratchy and very annoying to use.This wrist rest, however, is heaven. I really enjoy this wrist pad. This is a nice wrist rest for the average user. Very stiff at first, the wrist rest gets comfy after about a few three-hour sessions (yes, I counted). A gel wrist rest has pretty much one function: comfortably take the pressure off your wrists while you type. Overall this is a good, comfortable wrist rest for those of you who type at your computers a lot and are concerned about wrist issues. This wrist rest is great for the price and fits perfectly on my rolltop desk tray. This wrist rest is well made but it is really big! With this wrist rest, that is no longer the case!

Another wrist rest I have is a loft softer and has sprung a couple leaks; I do not think this one will do that. I don't know how much I can say about a gel wrist rest, but if you want one that is extra long and comfy, this fits the bill. But if you're looking for a thoughtfully designed and very comfortable wrist rest for use with your laptop, computer, etc., you'd be hard pressed to find a better suited and better crafted product. I'm looking forward to chucking my old wrist rest, the one with the fabric cover that's torn from the base exposing the rather nasty looking and feeling gel inside. If you're looking for a comfortable wrist rest, this one is a great choice.This covers the entire keyboard length - your wrists will be quite comfy because there's 2.5 inches of width to rest on. This wrist rest is longer than any other I've seen, so, it even supports your mouse hand.
