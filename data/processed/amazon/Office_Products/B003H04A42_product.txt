I used this product to identify / label storage boxes.I found the label pads it to be satisfactory and would purchase if necessary. Overall a great product. They are exactly as advertised and I don't think you will fine another like product that works any better. As always, excellent product from Post-it! Recommended product! Great little product for labeling shoe boxes and plastic storage boxes. Aside from that, a useful product! Good product. As always, Post-it comes through with an excellent product. This is a 3M product and you can buy it with confidence. A very handy product indeed. Nifty product. because it's difficult to think of a 3M product that doesn't do exactly what you need it to do, and do it without reducing the user to tears in the process.

This is a practical and durable as well as an energy- and cost-effective product.

Although we haven't had this product long enough to judge its durability, it would appear that the larger amount of surface being covered by stickiness makes these little labels pretty darn sticky.

)As with any post-it product, I always find the price to be a bit more than I think it should be.
