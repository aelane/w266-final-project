paper, but when I tried it only would cut through 11 and you're better off keeping it down to 6 or 7 sheets at the max so you don't wrinkle the paper. The clear see-though paper clamp also really helps with visibility and holds the paper in place very well. I really like this paper cutter. paper, I put the trimmer back in the box.To be perfectly frank, my old "machete" style trimmer is more effective and doesn't require batteries or blade changes (just an occasional sharpening). I already had a paper trimmer which costs more than this one. It means you can align your paper or move the blade at any time during or after paper alignment without wasting time repositioning paper or accidentally and ruining paper.Overall I like this Fiskars cutter a lot. This to me is better than those old fashioned paper cutters with the metal arm you pull down which if you were doing any more than a couple papers the papers would cut at slightly different angles if you weren't holding them steady. The paper arm keeps the papers flat and inline.I just love this paper cutter and I would recommend it to anyone who wants one.EDIT 5/30/12 - still working like a dream! To save paper, I usually make them two per page. Finally a  Hi tech paper cutter, aka "Fiskars LED SureCut Rotary Trimmer" this is like comparing a cassette tape to an mp3 player!This is by far the best paper cutter I have ever owned. He said we don't need a new paper shredder, that this was so much fun he would personally shred anything needing shredding for me! I'll say the lighting under the paper might be useful, but I have yet to find a reason to need it, a nice addition I'm sure, but not something that is a decisive factor in terms of purchasing this model.
