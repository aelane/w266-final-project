A good product overall, though, that I'd guess would be especially useful in an office setting where you'd like to have a pad of Post-it Notes continually handy by the copier or telephone. I didn't care for this product because it doesn't use standard post it notes. I have two of this product - one that I mounted on my bulletin board at home and one I have sitting on my desk at work. The product is worthwhile, but not outstanding. This product is awesome for me! I don't find this product to be very special. This is a great product to keep the post it clutter off your desk. Other than that, it is an overall great product. I give this product 4 stars. I was very pleased with this product from Post it. This product shows how much you care about your post its and it can show how organized you are. You probably won't buy this product unless you use post its a lot and therefore the post it dispenser should  be refillable. Overall, I was very pleased with this product. This product works ok, but the included velcro doesn't stick well and often comes apart when you try to pull out a post-it note. This is a nice little product. Other than that, I'm very pleased with this product. I like this product, but not sure I would ever buy one on my own. However, if this doesn't bother you, then it's a nice product. I found this product good though and useful, especially for those with minimal desk space. This is a great and innovative product. It's a product I can see would have office and home uses, as well as being handy in dormitories, nursing stations, and so forth. A useful and fun product; it is, indeed, quite handy for immediately writing down phone numbers, information given in phone calls, and so forth. Overall, the product will do that it's advertised for, with only small caveats. I like the product. I received this product and immediately posted one by my kitchen phone and the other on my computer desk. I love this product! Great great great product! The product comes with these "stickers" that you apply to the surface and then place the dispenser on top. This is a super product!

This product keeps the the notes in one easy to remember spot.However, the pen holder was a bit too shallow and often the pen fell on the floor if you accidentally hit it.

I personally don't think this product is necessary.

What I like about this product is, first of all it came in a set of 2, in my 2 favorite colors of hot pink and hot blue, the color of the notes, as well as the base and back of the dispenser.Secondly, the dispenser is thin so it doesn't take up any room, so I just have it on my desk, but you also have the option of mounting it on a wall if you so choose.
