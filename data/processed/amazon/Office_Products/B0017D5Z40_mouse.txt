I have been using a remote mouse for Easy Worship at church, and have really missed the precision I experience when I use my trackball at home. I loved this mouse pad so much that I got two of them, one for each side of the keyboard--I switch hands/sides often when using my mouse. The mouse runs over it in a movement so sleek, it's incredible. I've been using this mouse pad for the last couple of days and I love it. I was somewhat skeptical about getting a mouse pad that has a sticky back because I was afraid that it would either leave a residue on my desk or not stick down more than once. This mouse pad is very slim, good size, durable and generally feels good. Not a must have, but if you need a mouse pad, this is a good choice. He says the new mouse runs very easily over the surface, the best he has had in any previous mouse pads!!! Who would have thought a mouse pad could make such a difference? I grip my mouse above the surface, so don't often feel the prismatic texture of the surface.I love the 3M Precise Optical Mousing Surface, and heartily recommend it! As it happens, it works very well with an optical mouse. It's like running your mouse on sandpaper. With this mouse pad, there is no such problem. This means that I can sometimes hear the mouse moving across the surface (when the room is quiet enough to transmit said sound). I was using an old mouse pad I received free years ago at a B and M store. The mouse pad wouldn't stay put due to the smoothness of the cover for the adhesive backing. The mouse can be easily wiped with a damp towel without risk of damage. I own a 3M mouse pad that I am very happy with so when I needed one to take with me on a trip, I chose another 3M product. I was intrigued that supposedly, this mouse pad saves on battery life of the mouse and it's just what I need for a plane trip. When I first got the mouse pad, I was a bit disappointed because it was so thin. I find the mouse can move easily and accurately. I no longer have to move the mouse pad back to its proper place. I find that my mouse is more accurate using this mouse pad than other items I've tried. This mouse pad sheet has the perfect texture for great control over your mouse. A better mouse trap, absolutely. My Microsoft Wireless mouse glides easier and faster on this mousepad than it does on my desk, as if there is less friction. is a no-nonsense mouse pad from the good people at 3M. All performed smoothly on this mouse pad. My optical mouse did not like the pattern on the surface, and the cursor would jump occasionally. This mouse pad weighs next to nothing, sticks to the table to avoid slippage, and is lightly textured to help the mouse track better. Not only does your mouse zoom along the surface, but when you put your laptop away, it sticks right to the cover for next time. It also seems to track the mouse better and more consistently. Unfortunately, my mouse (an optical Hewlett Packard precision laser tracking mouse) skipped all over the place. Whether it actually makes your optical mouse batteries last longer is hard for me to verify.If you are in the market for a very thin mouse pad that looks quite plain, this may be for you. The 3M mouse pad is more of a mouse "sheet." I have been using a mouse on the surface of a wooden end table in conjunction with my Envy laptop. The mouse often loses contact with the USB receiver because of the surface pattern of the wood table. On granite my mouse gets jumpy from time to time, but on glass it simply doesn't work without a pad. Strangely it feels bumpier when moving the mouse over it than the Wowpad but the mouse seems to glide faster.For the price, it's a good product. The mouse pad is so thin it has the feel of using it on wood, the reason is I'm used to using a thick mouse pad but as time goes by it gets less annoying. I've used it with a wired and wireless mouse - in either situation you get a nice, smooth mousing surface.Does it save batteries? It does feel slightly different than a traditional mouse pad, but still great compared to a non-mousing surface when on the go.Overall, at this affordable price, it's hard not to consider this product. My mouse has burned a slick spot into my desk and now it can't navigate smoothly. This works great with my mouse. I have used it with both a connected mouse and a digital mouse, and it works great each time.What I like most about it is the very, very thin design. Yeah, it's "Just" a mouse pad. It really does allow very precise tracking using my Apple mouse. I bought and tested this using my Logitech M325 optical mouse. I use my mouse for regular things and I am not a graphic designer or someone who needs ultra fine pixel movements.That said, I lasted 15 minutes on this mousepad, then swapped back to my old felt/cloth surface one. Love that it is super flat and my optical mouse goes over it with no issues. Don't see the different between this and any other mouse pad.
