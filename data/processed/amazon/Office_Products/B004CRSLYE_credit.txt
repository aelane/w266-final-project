It will easily destroy credit cards and cd's with ease. It shreds credit cards with ease and everything is cross-shredded so there's no way someone can piece the strips back together..done that in the old single shred models :)I still really like my old Fellows P600C cross-shredder. No, it doesn't do credit cards and you have to limit to 3-4 sheets at one time, but it is a work horse, takes up very little floor space, and it's built pretty rock-solid compared to this model (cheep! It shreds credit cards, CD/DVDs, and large stacks of paper.The design of the Swingline Stack-and-Shred is very sleek and fits nicely into any office decor. It also shreds credit cards (one at a time). There is no separate "credit card slot" like some other units have. You simply insert the credit cards through the main 9" wide slot in the top center of the unit's lid. It's not ideal for credit cards. I rarely shred credit cards. I also was not thrilled how it shredded credit cards. After the second credit card, it became jammed.

It wouldn't take too much to recreate a credit card statement with one of those.On the other hand aPowershred MS-460Cs Safe Sense 10 sheet Confetti Cut Shredderwill make confetti out of your statements, and I mean confetti that would take a science lab a week to reconstruct.

I was never able to shred a single credit card.
