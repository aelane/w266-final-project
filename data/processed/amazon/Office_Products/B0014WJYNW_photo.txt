I adore this photo paper, which produces wonderfully bright and clear pictures with my Canon printer, and at this price, I'd never need to worry about buying a lesser brand just to save some bucks. We use this with out Canon photo printer and the paper works great for color prints. If you have a photo printer, this value pack makes it cost effective to print at home and not have to run to the drugstore to pick up prints. Only 4x6.Finally I found the perfect photo paper to help produce the photos I take!!! I have bought the cheaper photo paper and always come back to canon photo paper, for pictures your guaranteed to always have a clear and long life picture with this paper. I bought this to try on my HP Photosmart photo printer. Good, clear photo stock, and at a good price. I also just bought a photo album too!

I use this photo paper in my Canon MG7100 photo inkjet printer.

Canon makes excellent photo papers, definitely one of the best, and although there are other higher grade papers out there (and even from Canon), I feel these are the best value.Unless you want to print your photos to 8"x10"'s (or 8.5"x11"), you don't need to go to the top grade papers for the highest quality, as at 4"x6" the paper thickness and coating won't make much of a difference.For about 3 "Hamiltons" for 400 papers, that's an excellent deal.

I'm satisfied that this photo print paper renders the highest possible sharpness and most true color renditions.
