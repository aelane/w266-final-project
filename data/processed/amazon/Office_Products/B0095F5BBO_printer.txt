It was an excellent printer as to print quality, but when Canon came out with the first line of ChromaLife inks, I educated myself on the subject, and since the Pro-9000 wasn't able to accept the new inks, I decided to switch to an HP 8750, which used Vivera inks which are highly rated for longevity.The HP 8750 has served me very well for the intervening years, but they stopped supporting driver and software upgrades with Windows XP, so when I transitioned to Win 7 several functions of that printer were no longer available. I tested this printer with both glossy & matte paper. I feel that this printer delivers professional results without having to have great expertise with these wide format printers.Quality of PrintsThe quality of both printers was exactly the same, delivering consistent exhibition worthy prints on both glossy photo & matte art paper. I will do the same with this printer, it makes a real difference in saving ink. This is silly since this printer is HUGE and you can't just park it anywhere. I prefer to plug my printer into a separate wall outlet. The printer requires some calibrations with the computer. As you would expect for a printer costing about three times as much, the output Pixma Pro-10 puts the other two to shame. First, let me say that this is one heavy printer. That is not saying this printer is bad, but it was not true to the screen colors. Not unreasonable.The printer comes with everything you need, including a USB cable and a tray for printing CDs, and a sample pack of Luster paper.Canon printers have become my printer of choose in my house for the high quality prints and the great customer service I have received. This printer is up there with the better ones, if you can get by the warmer tones when you print or figure out the work around. The printer was so clear that it showed my lack of experience behind the camera.With ten ink cartridges, I thought setup was going to be difficult. This printer is HUGE. This printer can also handle paper sizes much larger than your standard printer, up to 13" x 19". You may also notice this printer has wireless (which is a bonus compared to it's more expensive sibling the Pro 1 which doesn't have it). I would argue that this printer, if used correctly is capable of producing prints that are better than you could get from most labs.Why?Complete control over all aspects of the print.What do I mean by "if used correctly? The printer is required to be connected to the wired network via a lan cable to the router. This printer will connect to your network for use by multiple devises seamlessly and will produce amazing high quality images with little effort.PROS:10-ink pigment system for professional quality prints up to 13"x19"Full HD movie printPrint Studio Pro Plug-InWorks on Mac or WindowsWi-Fi enabledBD/DVD/CD printingEnergy Star compliant1 Year limited warrantyCONS:Doesn't handle rolled photo paper The printer's heavy, too, and the interior bag shows two people lifting it. Once I've mastered the printer, I look forward to making some larger prints.The instructions are extremely easy to follow, and I think my 80-year-old neighbor could follow them. When setting up, the printer needs to be listed twice, once for USB and once for wireless, and you need to choose the right one.I first loaded this on my old MacBook Pro running OS 10.5.8, since the specs indicated the printer is not compatible with anything above 10.7. It's not a little printer you can put on your desk next to your laptop. It's a professional printer, and as such, is more the size/weight of a printing center. You cannot stand by the printer and watch as a couple of prints come out ... this is a "set it to print and go take a shower" sort of slow.All this said ...  Once you get this set up, the quality is EXCELLENT.

I just wish the printer had a different large format other than 13&#34;x19&#34;. The printer arrived when only my wife was home but luckily the delivery guy was nice enough to bring it all the way into the house and out of the rain. I don't want to be unfair, all printer makers do the same and Canon from my experience does include more with their printers, like photo paper packs, with their printers than other makers do. But with a printer it doesn't matter. So it wasn't perfect and I wanted to see what a "professional" printer would do.It took about an hour to setup the PRO 10 which included removing it from the box and all of the little cardboard containers holding the ink etc. My $100 printer does that. I would rather they put more into the printer then the cost to add what was needed to print on DVDs.But it is another great quality product from Canon. If you're looking for a printer that can produce amazing-looking prints from a personal digital library of photos, then I'd HIGHLY recommend the Canon PIXMA Pro-100... it's really a phenomenal printer, and it's unbeatable at the price. This is one HUGE printer! Although the printer comes with a sample pack of Canon's Pro Luster paper I ordered a pack ofCanon's Pro Platinumpaper. I know that Canon makes a more advanced printer in this line (Canon Pro-1) but I am thrilled with what the Pro-10 can do. I used the printer on a wired ethernet connection with a Mac running Mountain Lion.It does take a bit of time to unpack and setup the printer ( the printer is pretty heavy). The Mac immediately recognized the printer. The Canon Pro-10 printer is, physically, much like the other Canon printers in this line - almost identical to the Pro-100 - and set-up with the enclosed CD is very easy when following the on screen prompts.
