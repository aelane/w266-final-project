First I tried printing regular paper, which turned out as well as any inkjet printers I'd ever owned. No Automatic Document Feeder (ADF), low paper tray capacity, no automatic duplex printing, relatively slow print speeds, limited ink supply, low scanner resolution, no fax capability. Photo paper printing will up your per page costs to around 20-25 cents per print. There is no paper feeder so you can't stack up something to scan or copy and walk away.The LCD screen and menu are bright and clear. There is also a built in paper catcher in the front of the unit. These paper guides slide out for use and can be slid back into the printer body if it needs to be stowed away or moved. The paper feed mechanism works smoothly. I've used regular paper and glossy photo paper and the printer has never failed to feed the sheets through.The ink cartridges are very small and feel somewhat flimsy. While there is no paper tray on the bottom of the printer, there is a slanted paper feeder you can pull out on the back of the printer. Printing did not initially work, as it refused to recognize the paper in the tray. Fun to watch but if he gets the paper then it's torn etc. He looks at me like to say "why are you not helping me get the paper?

With paper loaded in the back and the paper tray extended in the front, the dimensions are 15.25" wide x 12" tall x 17.50" deep.Be sure and take all of the packing tape and foam off and out of the printer before using.

The paper catch tray is smaller and not as prone to being bumped into and broken.

If the paper doesn't sit exactly right in the tray, the labels are ruined.
