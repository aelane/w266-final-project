One thing that we look for is speed. The only thing that might confuse you, if you're used to using double sided printing, in the "print preview" window, normally on manual double-sided printing you'll see page 1 & 2 side-by-side; in the "auto double-sided mode" the preview shows pages stacked on top of each other, like normally when printing on one-side, but when it prints, page one will print first and then the printer will rotate the page and print side two on the reverse, all without spitting the paper out. But I guess the main thing is it reacts almost instantly when I need it too.I print a lot of documents and emails from my iPhone 5. I had the whole thing setup and in use within minutes.Print quality is excellent. The only thing that I did not like about this machine is that I could not get it to work using only a 1/2 sheet of paper fed through the back. This thing is FAST!Apparently it will make copies, even two-sided copies, and print envelopes of various sizes if you use the rear-side paper loading area. Another thing I like is the 2 sided Duplex which I have never had on a printer.Worth the cost! But that left me without duplexing again, about the the only thing that the HP had that the Epson I bought didn't. So I took the same thing I just printed, threw it up in the document feeder for the scanner, and picked "scan" from my computer. Granted, it's probably not the most practical thing, but if your USB slots are full on your computer, consider this a freebie for that jump-drive you have!So, if you're looking for a fantastic inkjet printer, look no further. The first thing to do in the setup process is take all the tape off the printer, then hook the power cord up to the printer and outlet. I ended up taking the whole thing out to see the end of paper.Wifi was a breeze to set up!
