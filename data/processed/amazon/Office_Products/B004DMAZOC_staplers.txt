There are better staplers, but they are MORE expensive. I'm usually very good at jamming staplers. I am sitting here looking at 2 useless staplers that never work if I am trying to staple more than 2 or 3 pieces of paper, so I really appreciate having one that actually works consistently every time. I usually associate staplers with frustration, because so many I have used have been difficult to operate/reload and are unreliable. I was pretty skeptical about this staplers claims & prepared to hate it after seeing the reviews. Larger staplers are also much more expensive. I know what you're thinking, but honestly, we own at least 3 staplers --brown, black, military gray/green-- and they are hard to find if they've been left on a book shelf or messy table.--I like the 'weird' Ergonomic design. Solid.--Unlike some staplers that open fully --so you can staple onto bulletin boards--this one doesn't.Overall, I'd say that this is good product for the price. I personally prefer the regular staplers that sit on the desk and can be picked up if needed.Note: I am a fan of Swingline. It's quiet too compared to most staplers. The basic staplers are a pain (literally) after long periods of use. The automatic staplers are wonderful but tend to walk off when left in a very public place. It is not boxy and sharp-edged like most staplers. Just load the staplers and close it back up. For as long as I can remember, I've bought the little red Swingline staplers. While I don't use staplers much any more (all of my documents are sent via email or dropbox in PDF format and read on Kindles or iPads), when I need one, I really need one.
