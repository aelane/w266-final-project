Anyway these erasers are guaranteed to last you a really long time. With 3 erasers... do the math (since I can't). 3 erasers equals a really long time. Hi-polymer erasers are much cleaner to use. These are great pencil erasers. What can I say about these erasers. I bought these erasers for my 7 year old daugher for school. I can't live without these exact erasers.

Despite being 'premium erasers,' I want to reiterate that they cannot erase people you don't care for or mistakes from your past.

Still, I highly recommend these erasers.

Ominous Title, right?These are fine, just normal erasers.
