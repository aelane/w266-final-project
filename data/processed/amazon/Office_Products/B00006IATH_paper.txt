If you need to trim legal paper lengthwise, this trimmer can do it.Overall, it is a fine trimmer and isn't too expensive. This desktop paper trimmer is perfect for my home office. This Swingline paper trimmer will cut up to 15 inches which is just what I needed. The paper trimmer is listed as Lite and it really is light weight. I highly recommend this Guillotine Trimmer for all paper trimming uses I've tried out 3 paper cutters just this year. I also use paper cutters in my art.This one, by far, outperformed all the others, even my commercial ones. The paper is easy to line up, so you get satisfying results. With paper, it just wants to bend the paper down instead of cutting it, and even with cardstock it is very hard to make an accurate cut. This replaced a smaller, somewhat flimsier paper cutter and while that one was merely adequate, I feel this one is ideal for home use. I use paper cutters primarily for origami, where getting straight and accurate cuts is CRITICAL. This paper trimmer looks cheap (the body is gray plastic), but is sturdy and reliable and more than meets all our small office needs. I purchased this paper cutter for home paper craft projects. Previously, I had bought a cheap paper cutter and it just didn't do the job and basically 'ate' my paper because it tore it up so badly. If all else fails, just flip the paper upside down and cut the part you were having issues with from the top. If you are used to the old wooden paper cutters, like I am, than you may be a little disappointed. I did realize after I got it that it didn't have a paper guide for repeated cutting of the same size paper though. This paper cutter works great. It works just like the big heavy-duty paper cutters at the elementary schools.
