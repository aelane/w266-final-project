These pens write amazingly well and are perfect for me. I love these pens. The pens write smooth and even. I bought these pens because I like the way Pilot Gel Pens write. I still have two pens. Best pens on the market as far as I'm concerned. I've used these pens for several years now & love the ease of writing with them & they don't skip! If you like pens that write smoothly and as thin as possible you will love love love these pens. Though both are 0.7mm gel pens, I think that the writing of the 207 is just a bit crisper than that of the G-2. These are great pens. These pens write all the time, the ink flows freely and they are slender and fit well in one's hand. I recently discovered these pens and love them. I will buy more of these...These pens roll with such ease when you write with them that it allows you to be a betterwriter. When I write with these pens, and ONLY these pens, people comment upon how beautiful my handwriting is. These pens will do their best to break you of that habit. The best pens around these are by far my favorite green pens. I think I will just stick with the regular Pilot G2 pens (do NOT buy the cheaper imitations, they are terrible). They are the only pens my husband will use on his job. I've priced the pens at office stores, but have determined that Amazon has the best price, at just a little over a $1 per pen. You can find cheaper pens, but this pen will more than pay for itself in its quallity... I came across these pens while looking at some other items and since--at the time--it was near Valentine's Day I thought they would make a good gift for the ladies, both with being pink and being for  Breast Cancer. The Pilot G2 Ultra Fine Point Blue Gel Ink Pens are my favorite pens. I highly recommend these pens.

It's not only one of the most inexpensive pens (less than $1.50 for a pack of 10), it's also probably the most efficient pen, with a single pen able to write over 100,000 words (or about 2 novels).

I have used expensive pens with replacement cartridges that are far from cheap, but hands down this pen takes the prize.For writing, blue has been my color of choice for some time, and the color of blue this pen creates is the best.

I also prefer the retractable pens over pens with removable covers, being you don't have a cover to lose, leaving the point exposed.
