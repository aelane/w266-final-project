We have several whiteboards scattered around our small business that we use for announcements, sales, and notes for our students and occasionally they are left for long periods of time or accidentally used with permanent markers.These erasers are essentially sponges and are somewhat flimsy, so will not be using them regularly (we have "standard" erasers" for that), but will be using them for periodic deep cleaning of our shop whiteboards. Definitely a good to have if you use whiteboards a lot (we do in our home for schooling).I just gave it four stars because it is one of those cleaners where you just add water - so there are some chemicals on the sponge already. It's so easy and leaves the whiteboards looking like new. They clean my whiteboards much better than my average eraser. I have been using whiteboards for a long time and have a board that has faint residue from having been written on with an incompatible type of dry erase marker - nothing has been able to get that out, even using a cleaner that removes permanent marker still left some residual discoloration. We have relatively new whiteboards and these erasers have kept them spotless. Yes, it does erase whiteboards (assuming you are erasing dry erase markers). They work well and are a much needed to making whiteboards even better. It reminds me of the Magic Erasers only for whiteboards and for that alone I think it's a great product. It is a must have, I have used it on new & old whiteboards and it cleans them with ease! The3M Whiteboard Eraser for Permanent Markers and Whiteboardssays it cleans whiteboards without the use or special sprays or cleaners. You know how whiteboards get... there's a period of time where erasing your dry erase markings is simple but after a while they become almost like permanent marker -- you have to break out the spray cleaner to get rid of the marks as the regular fluffy eraser doesn't do anything.This solves that problem. Where I work, we have numerous whiteboards, and most of them were rather dirty when I received these erasers. We have some whiteboards at the office that show significant "ghosting" from usage over time - it seems that every whiteboard is like this. Dry-erase whiteboards are everywhere where I work, and many of them have residue from attempts to erase ancient marks.
