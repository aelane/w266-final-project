Love the idea, and the refills for the 3x3 notes are available just about anywhere. Nice idea but the holder is rather clunky and doesn't dispense the post-it notes as well as it should. It is a good idea that many people will find useful. Great idea from Post-It:  You can mount this dispenser almost on any flat surface and it even has a space for a pen(not included.) Simple idea and makes life a little more simple. Also, even if you like the idea of having a dispenser in one place, securing it correctly is not picnic and the dispenser itself is a made a little on the cheap side.I have nothing against the product and there seem to be many satisfied customers, but I cannot give it more than 3 stars due to it's price versus regular Post-its and did not find the product's bell as whistles to my liking. Great idea! This one is a great idea! Pretty neat idea overall and in a good price range! Grand idea actually. The idea of it was great and executed well. The idea of sticking a Post-it on a vertical surface, but then needing a flat surface in order to write on the note seems silly. This is a really cool idea and it's even more convenient than I expected it to be. This is a great idea...in theory you can take this item and basically mount it anywhere. This is a good idea.

But the idea of being able to stick the dispenser on the wall is a good one since the table model is usually buried under paper and brochures.

Overall, I think this is a neat idea if you want another type gadget to hold your Post-its; however, the pen holder and ease of dispensing could use some improvement.

Post-It Pop-up Notes Dispenser is a nifty new idea from those wonderful people who make the ubiquitous Post-Its.
