The outcoming sheet is warm, but not hot. I also used it to laminate a 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper to use on an outdoor sign and the laminated paper did not weather! I ran a clean sheet of cardstock through to clean it but still had the smell. I did a full sheet and it will took less than a minute to pull it through. I was impressed at how well the sheet melted to the craft. It comes with a sheet of cardboard you are supposed to feed through after each session to clear out any extraneous adhesive left behind. It's easy to feed in straight, but if you become careless and feed a sheet in crooked, it may run past it's borders and cause one edge to be curled up. You can buy a Cleaning Sheet or simply use a sheet of inexpensive 20 lb. To keep my Laminator running smooth, I always run a sheet of cheap 20 lb. If Swingline had only included at least one sheet of their great laminating pouches, I would have been able to use this laminator immediately, instead of waiting to buy some pouches.

You can do a normal sized sheet of paper (8-1/2 x 11) through it.

Trust me as I tried it with a sheet that had type on it just to see if what I expected would happen.
