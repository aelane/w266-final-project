I got this looking for a simple copy holder...I was easily deceived by the picture thinking it would be much less than it is! This copy holder has good capacity and very solidly constructed legs. Overall, I believe this copy holder to be a good product.Pros*Good looking (although it will most likely be hidden behind copy or a book*Holds books flat (due to elastic band, and bottom lip)*wide enough for to hold two 8 1/2 x 11's*very sturdy (due to the heavy base)Cons*Seems the clear plastic could break (also due to the heavy base)*adjusting the angle is not as easy/accurate as it should beAlso of note: this won't work well as a cookbook holder because there is no splash guard for the books This copy holder helps you keep a book in a slanted upright position so that you can refer to it easily. I've used copy holders for years and find them very convenient. My favorite copy holder ever was a little bar that stuck on a CRT monitor and could be folded back against the side of the monitor to move it out of the way when not being used and held it at the perfect eye level when in use. I wasn't sure how excited you could get about a "copy holder", but I had a chance to try it out so I took it. The copy holder will take up about 12" space lengthwise & is 18" wide, but that means most books & magazines can be open so both pages show at once. This copy holder would have been perfect for her. I'm very capable of copying what I'm reading from so I have used copy holders before and was, quite honestly, looking for something to not only use with books and papers but to also house my new iPad. Not only can I use this copy holder with books and papers and my iPad, heck, I can do it all at one time!I must not have been looking at the description and focusing on the details of 300 sheet capacity as well as 18 inches wide. The copy holder is 18" wide and is sturdy enough to hold up to 300 sheets of thick paper, catalogs, books, and more. The copy hold fits perfectly on most desks or tables and is designed to be positioned directly between your computer monitor and keyboard, however it will easily fit anywhere. This copy holder is great! I chose 3M's 18 inch wide copy holder because I generally spend at least a couple of hours a day doing research, gathering notes either from books or online sources. With the copy holder, I just slip the marked-up pages behind the elastic cord that keeps everything in place and type away. I expect I'll be ready to worship the copy holder once I get into that phase of work.The copy holder is designed to sit between keyboard and monitor, but I only use a laptop.
