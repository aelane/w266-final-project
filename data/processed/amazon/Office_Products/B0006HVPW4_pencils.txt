I draw and this means that I constantly am sharpening pencils. As far as sharpening pencils, I can get a stab-worthy point out of pencils with this (I've actually stabbed myself enough to leave a little cut on accident with a pencil sharpened from this). Some pencils sharpen better than other pencils, but this sharpener works lovely. This one gets hot faster than my other one so I can only sharpen 7 pencils before I feel that I need to stop and let it "rest" before it overheats and stops running.I also note that the pencils don't seem to get sharpened all the way on one side, you have to twist them half way through a sharpen to make sure all sides get sharpened to a point if that makes sense.So while I am disappointed with the quality I think this is the best you are going to do for the price. It's getting pencils extremely sharp. The other pencils came out super sharp, and ready to go. Even after sharpening 50+ pencils it showed no sigh of overheating.Cons: It's too loud to use while the baby is sleeping.If you don't have to worry about this being used while a baby is napping, this is the sharpener for you! It works equally well on colored pencils, 2B pencils, 4F pencils, and all the others.I couldn't do without it and I highly recommend it. It brings average sized pencils to a nice sharp point. Works well on colored pencils as well.Because it is electric, the power and strength of the sharpener is always consistent.

This is particularly true of my colored pencils.

I was initially impressed and almost ready to sharpen pencils.

Out of said 200 pencils sharpened, I had maybe five points break in total.
