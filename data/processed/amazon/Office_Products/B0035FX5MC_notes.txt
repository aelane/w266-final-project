The actual notes are those that fan out accordion style and that's fine and appropriate as it works with the dispenser. Pulling out the post-it notes are easy and because of the post-it notes weight is quite small, you don't have to worry about the strips falling off the wall.I did a test for removal of the dispenser from a wall to see if it leaves any bad residue and overall, if taken off correctly, there was no residue.

Small, flat, easily obscured, Post-It pads have a tendency to drift to the bottom of paper piles or into the backs of desk drawers and supply boxes...

The Post-it Pop-up Notes Dispenser holds z-fold post-it notes and allows you to easily dispense them. * Fun bright colors* Sticky notes stay in place and don't wiggle around. The notes fit easily and are just as easy to remove. The notes are fan folded, so that the glued side alternates from left to right on the notes. Unfortunately, you cannot just stick ordinary sticky notes in there because they do not alternate the glue, so they won't pop out of this dispenser.Also, I didn't notice it at first, but there is a velcro like pad on the back so you can hang the dispenser, keeping it from falling over when you pull a note out.

However, the fan-folded sticky notes tend to get slightly bent as I pull them out of the dispenser. It holds the standard alternating Post-It notes - the 1st note pulls left, the next right, left, right, etc. Finding the notes is usually not an issue - as we know each other well enough to put the note where the other will certainly find it... but finding a piece of paper and a pen is another matter.

Tired of grabbing several Post-it notes when you only want one? The Post-it notes have the adhesive edge alternate from one side of the square of paper to the other side, and back again.
