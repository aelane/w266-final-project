I prefer using the individual rolls rather than the large rolls with the refillable dispenser, as I always find those hard to use, and they are too bulky for around the house. I am still looking for the bigger rolls but until we find a deal on them I will purchase these. six rolls of high quality packing tape in individual dispensers. I used to buy 2-3 rolls of packing tape from the store every time I would run out but stopped doing that when I realized I could order 6 online for the price of 3 in store and wouldn't have to leave my house to do so. I go through several rolls of this per year and I have to say I'm very satisfied with the toughness and stability of this tape. The rolls of tape are on the small side, but when you considewr the cost of six dispensers and the same number of rolls of tape, it is not a bad deal. You get six rolls and six cutters, not just one cutter and six rolls. These rolls have quality cutter dispensers. Nice stuff.My only quibble is that I would not bother with such small rolls in a 6-pack. I have the 22.2-yard rolls with dispenser, so that's what I'll be reviewing.I've tried generic brands, Scotch mailing tape, and most recently a packing tape by OfficeMax. If you're moving, you will probably be better off with the larger rolls without dispenser. I have gone through two rolls wrapping just a few packages because the tape doesn't stick to anything except itself. I have been buying the larger rolls without the 'holder' that comes with each one of these rolls. The rolls could be larger, as there is too much waste in this world as it is and it seems foolish to make so many small rolls and so many plastic dispensers when a larger roll would work.
