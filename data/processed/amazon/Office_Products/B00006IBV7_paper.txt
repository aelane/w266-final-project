Then, keep the paper handy. It's very easy to use, and the paper quality is great, which makes it very professional looking. I frequently use Avery paper because of the consistently high quality, and these business card sheets did not disappoint. The paper quality is good (although I would like it if it was a bit thicker) and it tears apart really easily. The paper stock is a nice, heavy weight and the individual cards feel appropriately thick with a good solid feel. I've never found a paper that gives the cards the same look as a professionally printed card, and this paper is no different. The paper too is thick and of high quality.The business card templates that are downloadable from the Avery website, however, did not impress me all that much. The heavy, stiff paper used for these is very smooth and bright white for crisp, clear, text and high res. It would be nice to see a heavier weight paper offered, with the understanding that some home printers malfunction when the paper weight is too high.The Clean Edge system is where this business card paper really impresses. I do experience occasional paper feed issues with my Epson Workforce 600, but a little coaxing tends to get things back on track quickly.Make no mistake - this is a premium product. The paper does take the ink relatively well, but there are so many variables, e.g. Quality paper, comes with detailed and easy-to-follow instructions, fair amount of design templates to choose from and easy access to customer service if you have any questions. * The paper is really white and the results really pop with great contrast.Cons:*NONESummary:Avery has some software for both PC and Mac called "Design Pro" which I find works really well with these.

The paper is lined with a crisp plastic that separates neatly and gives the card a nice weight and feel.

This is not the paper's fault it's a limitation of the technology.

The paper holds the ink nicely, and is of a high quality.
