The lines don't fade or smudge as some lesser filler papers are prone to do. The lines are clear and the wide ruling makes it easy for younger kids to learn to write. The lines are consistent darkness with no fading, but over all you'll do better if you buy a store brand on sale. Unless the lines are off, this is a reliable product. The lines are the correct spacing and are dark enough for the most part but there are some pages that are lighter than others.The price of this package of paper stunned me at 3 dollars a pack. The lines are nicely inked and the wide rule is a better choice for younger writers.Just "ok." The lines are wide and dark enough for me to see on both sides of each sheet. This is more along the lines of what I'd expect from a dollar-store brand. The lines are printed consistently. The wide ruled lines give the young writers more room to express themselves in words and numbers. I cut off the red lines, and then cut down by about five lines from the top to get a good-sized lined piece of paper that can be jazzed up with rubber stamps. Plus, it's easyto use.However, I wish lines were little bit more vividon the sheets so that I can see where I'm writing.Overall, it's a great paper.T.
