I really like the sketch book. Inexpensive enough to doodle away but quality enough to show off a sketch or drawing.The paper weight is not listed, but I'd guess it's about 60 lb., with medium&#34; toothiness.&#34;This book is suitable for sketches in pencil, ink, marker, and charcoal. This sketch diary is adequate. If you're looking for a nice &#34;portable&#34; sketch book, this is a good one to have. I've been using this little sketch book to practice various zentangles before I commit them to the (much more expensive) tiles.I've also used it to try play with my Prismacolor colored pencils, trying different blending and shading combinations. I've put this sketch book through a lot of tests. A good sketch book is a wonderful thing if you have fingers that itch to draw or write or create on white space. And other sketch books can be too small--seeming more like mini notepaper books, they barely have room for sketches at all and usually have only a handful of pages.So finding something about the size of a tablet device in a spiral binding is indeed very useful. It's nice for a daily sketch pad, especially for a student.

This is a wonderful sketch book, at a very affordable price, and it is also SFI Certified (Sustainable Forestry Initiative) so you know the paper stock has been sustainably harvested.

I have been using the Academie sketch pads for quite a while.

This sketch book is a great portable alternative to the larger pads.
