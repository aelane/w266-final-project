The scanner works great and efficiently-but then for some reason the FATAL ERROR would pop up on the machine and it would quit working overnight.We would get the replacements, but they were all refurbished. However, this dedicated scanner reminds you why it's better to own one machine that gets the job done right - for those with an occassional need for scanning this might be over-kill but for small business owners, those with a home office or even a small general purpose office this is a "must have". Any scanner is only as good as the results and this was able to clearly scan everything from standard documents to grubby, wrinkled receipts with a clear output. This scanner is worth every penny if you want to truly go paperless in your office. It's been like this since my first Epson flatbed scanner about 12-years ago.-> UPDATE: uninstalled all Epson software. !This would be an excellent scanner for small-to-mid-sized offices. I installed the scanner on a Windows 7 64 bit machine using the CD provided. The scanner then worked wonderfully. I did this and the scanner "worked" but with only a driver installed there was no Epson Scan software or anything. I got the Epson WorkForce Pro GT-S50 scanner because of my needs in copying  oversize contracts and prospectuses that I have to deal with and one of the great things about this machine is the ability to copy 8.5 X 36 inches long,YES let me repeat that... UP TO 36 INCHES LONG!! I had tried using  a flatbed scanner but it was tedious and time consuming.
