The little strip is easier. I was always forced to add an additional strip of scotch-tape to the outside to make sure it stayed closed.When I got these envelops, the first thing I did was head to our deep-freezer to test them out (It's summer right now). It's a pretty thin strip of adhesive, so I still put a piece of tape on the flap, not to prevent tampering per se, but just to make sure that it doesn't accidentally get ripped open while in transit.So, I put a standard bank check in the envelope and held it up to my little halogen desk lamp. You simply unfold the strip to reveal the adhesive. Rather than pull off a thin strip, you instead lift up a lower flap that remains attached to the envelope, revealing the adhesive underneath, and then fold the upper flap on top of it, to form a seal. This is more waste- friendly because there is no leftover strip. There is no strip to pull off and then have to throw away (or let pile up on your desk like I normally do!). Simply pull off the strip, and voila! The adhesive strip works great and forms a pretty strong seal immediately. There is no plastic strip to throw away, and there is no need for moisture to seal. There's no strip of paper to peel away and throw out. Instead of peeling off a disposable strip, you just fold up a little mini-flap to reveal the adhesive and then close the envelope normally.The blue security printing does a good job of hiding the contents from prying eyes, the paper is of good quality and the construction is first rate. Every one I've ever used like this has had a little strip that I need to toss once I've sealed the envelope. Unlike other's I've tried where you remove a waxy strip to reveal the sticky adhesive underneath, these envelopes have an extra flap at the bottom of the opening that you unfold. This exposes the adhesive strip on the bottom. This exposes a thin strip of adhesive. I like that there is no strip to throw away because I would most likely ball it up and find it in my pocket later on. What to do with that silly strip that protects the adhesive strip on so many other non-lick envelopes. While it's a little slower to use than simply ripping off a strip, it's preferable to licking, and also nice not to have that leftover strip to throw away. Nothing too special.I like how they seal by lifting a flap instead of peeling off a strip, makes it much faster to stuff an envelope and much easier to send through the printer. No strip to peel off, no yucky glue to taste, and the paper quality is good. The adhesive strip is useful but did tear on several occasions. They have a self-adhesive strip that probably can be undone without too much notice so don't believe the product description. Sealing strip appears to work well. Well, these have a peel-away strip to expose a self seal flap. What's best, though, is not having that little pull-off strip that comes with most 'no-lick' envelopes. Sure, that strip is just one small piece of paper--but multiply that by the millions of people who pull them off and throw them away, and you've got serious paper waste. If you're like me, you'll try to recycle the pull-off strip, but items that small usually don't make it into the bales for recycling, and end up getting thrown away.
