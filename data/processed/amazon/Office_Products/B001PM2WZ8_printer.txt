As a 'home' printer, this comes as close to perfect as they come. HP supplies the printer itself, 'starter' ink cartridges, print heads and a phone wire. The printer can be controlled from a PC or directly through a touch-screen color display and several buttons that generally duplicate options on the menus available through the touch-screen interface. It can be configured to either a local printer, connected to a PC via a USB cable or as a network printer, wired (Ethernet) or wireless (802.11g). It monitors the printer's status, including the ink levels and allows for configuring printing, scanning, faxing and other capabilities such as the forwarding of documents to network folders (tested) or to email (not tested yet). I love this printer!!! I mainly bought this printer for scanning and faxing, as I use an HP LaserJet for all of my printing needs. This printer is very well-built and sturdy, plus provides all of the features anyone could ever want! From what I understand, there is no comparable competing printer. Before purchasing this printer, be aware of the astronomical ink cartridge prices that will set you back $114 + tax/shipping for all four (Black $35.99, Cyan $25.99, Magenta $25.99, and Yellow $25.99). For a printer costing $500 it should be more.
