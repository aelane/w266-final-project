So I opened my MS World Avery Wizard and it downloaded new labels. These labels are no exception - they are good white textured labels as you see on the pic. These pretty labels are perfect for bridal and baby showers for those who care about details to decorations. There are nine labels per sheet, and the labels adheres well.The template took some hassle to get through Avery since it isn't a standard set. The labels come off from the sheets and stick easily. Additionally, unlike some other labels which had issues with synthetic material, the Avery scallops stuck well to a wide variety of clothing material.Printing and designing is easy, but you have to register an email. You can use pre-designed labels & insert text or you can design your own. These labels will be used for special occasions. I love using Avery labels on my various projects. These scalloped labels have a lovely pearlized finish that adds an extra touch of class to gift packages or craft projects with unlimited other possibilities. These labels are perfect for that special project. I received these labels for free from the Vine program, and I was excited to try them, as I am an artist & graphic designer, and like to make my own cards. These Avery scalloped labels are great. Design and create your own labels, then quickly print them out on your home printer. These labels are super cute. These scalloped labels have a gentle sheen and print up well with my inket printer. Nice labels if you like scalloped edges (I don't particularly.) These scalloped little labels are fantastic. I love Avery labels--there's something for any occasion or need. The labels are a nice size and have an attractive &#34;pearly&#34; finish to them that classes things up. I used the labels to put on gifts and they ended up looking very attractive. There are 72 labels on 8 sheets (9 labels per sheet). I don't think you can go wrong with these labels and Avery brand is my favorite. These labels are pretty, with scalloped edges and a pearly finish. The labels are perfect, the problem lies with the fact that there are no blank downloadable templates available to use for them. I really love these labels but I won't be purchasing any until there is a blank, downloadable template. These labels are very attractive and have a plethora of uses. These labels can be used to use on treat bags, as cupcake banners, bottle labels, gift labels, name tags and for many other uses. These labels are just the right size for the top of a quart mason jar so I used them to label my pie filling with a &#34;From the Kitchen of...&#34; message. I didn't care for these as much as the glossy labels I typically get, which tend to be brighter and more colorful when printed. Love these labels! The labels are beautiful and so are the templates to choose from on Avery. I have downloaded other labels before, even from Avery, and have never had this problem. You can also just write on them if you want.I definitely recommend these labels to card makers These are SUCH beautiful labels!!! Great Avery labels, these are beautiful labels, thick, with sticky backs and a lovely pearly finish! These Avery Pearlized Scallop Round Labels are sweet little labels that make perfect tags for gifts or labels for goodies such as jars of jam or sauces. The labels are about 2-1/2 inches in diameter, have a lovely satiny finish and are scalloped on the edges. These labels print nicely using the instructions that come in the package and aren't especially susceptible to smearing and smudging. I thought these labels would be a great addition to packaging up my sales while adding a little advertising for repeat customers. I was very excited about using these cupcake topper labels for my niece's baby shower. I have worked with Avery labels for many years and assumed this one couldn't be any more difficult than any of the others.T
