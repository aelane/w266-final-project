The built-in wrist rest is excellent, and ergonomically sound. The wrist pad displaces pressure points leaving your wrist in a more relaxed wrist position. I turned it sideways and got the wrist support out of the way.My second observation is that the material of the pad, at least new, has very little friction. It supports my wrist well. The wrist pad is very firm, but seems fine to me. Then consider the wrist rest takes up two inches, leaving less than seven inches of space to work with. First, the elevated wrist pad, and second the microbial coating on the pad to reduce the spread of germs. Mouse pads with a wrist rest have been around for some time now. A wrist rest is one of the most afforadable ergonomic tools we can buy. Bascially I am resting my wrist while using it, and there is no pronation. If I bend my wrist, I cannot grasp the mouse. I do think this one is a little less likely to cause the wrist to feel sticky/sweaty than the more rigid Precise pad was, too. I was expecting this wrist pad/mouse pad to be soft and comfortable for my wrist. Instead it is a very firm wrist pad that is Very supportive....so it does its job, just not in a comfortable way. The wrist rest is nice, but not really resting if you keep moving it.However, I have several mouses (or is that mice?) The wrist rest is great though many mouse pads have that. I like the attached wrist rest. The wrist rest is about 3 inches wide which wont take up too much space yet give you ample room to move around. The wrist is firm, not foamy. The wrist wrest is angled and about 1/2 inch at highest point and rest of pad is around 1/4 inch thick. The foam wrist wrest is very firm, though comfortable enough. The wrist rest takes some getting used to as well. The 3M wrist rest prevents me from doing that because when I pull the mouse back, it runs into the wrist rest which at the highest point, is almost 3/4".
