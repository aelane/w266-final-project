Wrap the check in something else, like extra paper or discarded coupons to obscure the account number. I tested it by placing a check inside and you could tell what was in there. I tested this by inserting a check and holding the envelope up to a sunlit window. I could clearly see the cancelled check placed inside, and the same was true with a 20 dollar bill. On the check, I could see all of the information (including the bank name, check number, routing and checking account numbers. Then I tried it again with the check and a typical supporting document and nothing legible was visible.I did have one concern and that involved the envelopes compatibility with my printer; the patented technology for sealing the flap results in the flap sticking out just a little from the envelope. It's also very nice to know when your including a check it is not visable to the naked eye, even if that's all that is in the envelope. Or they can ask to be paid by check for something. I have to admit that I do feel more secure sending out a check (or anything of monetary value) in this envelope. It is still best to ensure that the check is hidden inside the bill or a sheet of notebook or typing paper. If you both put a check and statement in it, or a folded letter, you cannot read them. Same check but in the Quality Park #10 and even with a strong LED power flashlight I could not read anything on the inside. I put a check in one and held it up to the light. Perfect for sending a check ,legal documents,or something you just would rather couldn't be seen if it were held up to a light bulb. I couldn't see through them when I enclosed a check folded inside a piece of paper within. :-)  If a check is in the envelope alone, you can even see my Lord of the Rings check design with the help of bright light. I wrapped a check in regular printer paper and tried again...  You can still see my check. There is a blue check patter on the inside of the flap that further shows any tears or opening.Overall I think its a medium weight paper for basic use. check) by holding it up to a lamp.All that said, I would expect that if you really want to ensure there is no tampering, or anyone reading the content of your mail, I would use the style of envelopes UPS, Fedex or USPS uses.
