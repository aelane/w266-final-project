These are decent sticky notes, but fail the critical test vs. Post Its - they don't stick as well (and upon repeated use).The appearance is also a bit different from regular PostIts if you really want to be anal about it (you can see the band of adhesive from the front of the sticky note).Big issue - less sticky.

The notes stick well but don't mar surfaces. I highly recommend these notes. Unfortunately, these notes are not as good as their rival Post-Its, primarily because the adhesive isn't as sticky, and the sheets come off their cube with a little more curl.Still, these notes are an adequate substitute for Post-Its, especially if you can find them cheaper. I am always using sticky notes both at home and office. The Avery sticky notes don't have this problem. Sticky notes are here to stay and we especially like these. These sticky notes are awesome!
