Consequently these tabs are a very practical time saver. These numbered tabs by Avery are sturdy, large numbered tabs. The tabs themselves are not too thick or thin. As long as you know that's all you need, these are great tabs for sorting sections of documents, or for organizing a notebook. I got the NoteTabs that have white sequential tabs up to 10. How cool can note tabs be? The numbered tabs adhere greatly to my textbook pages. These tabs look so much nicer and neater than the strips of post-it tape I've been using to mark book references.These are sturdy-made tabs, too. These semi-permanent tabs can be very usefull for those who maintain notebooks where the notebook pages can serve as markers for the section desired. Also, the tabs seem to be holding up pretty well despite being tossed around in a bag full of horse supplies and a riding helmet going in and out of the car to the barn etc.The second half of the tabs I took to my elderly housebound neighbor and helped her use to mark the pages with her favorite passages in her large print Bible. She was/is delighted with these tabs. These tabs also work well on the vinyl sleeves for my CD binders. These tabs have numbers on them, 1 thru 10, and there are two sets. The tabs are re-usable they come right off and re-stick again and again.The body part is about two inches across and one inch high and it is clear and you can write on it with pen or pencil. These tabs are great for organizing bookmarks in all kinds of books - from technical manuals to cookbooks. But, they could easily be more permanent tabs - marking favorite recipes, for example.As temporary markers, they seem to work with most paper - although the package does caution that they will not work with all papers and ink. These tabs are really great in the office for identifying and prioritizing documents and files quickly. These pre-numbered tabs provide a green option for those wanting to get away from file folders. These tabs can be repositioned, heavy enough to withstand continued usage and the numbered dividers allow for easy reference. Avery recommends to use these tabs for organizing textbooks, notebooks, binders, cookbooks and more. The tabs are see-through. The tabs themselves are a bit large and fitting an entire set within one binder might be difficult, but that's not really a huge complaint of mine. You can write on the tabs, too -- which is handy for adding the months. The tabs work wellThe 2 X 1.5 Avery NoteTabs with numbers 1-10 worked well on my three ring binder. They figured out what we really needed - durable tabs that are easy to apply anywhere. First, these little tabs are not that little - 2" x 1.5". I can see through the tabs so it's okay to stick them on words. These tabs are a useful alternative to the sets that are available for purchase. I used the tabs for presentation binders. (20 tabs total).They are basically glorified post its.I find they are helpful for textbooks. Avery Numbered NoteTabs are numbered file tabs with a peel-and-stick self adhesive for easy application. You can also write on the tabs and you could probably put other labels over the numbers if necessary.I hate messing with permanent file tabs and with these, I just peel them off, stick them on and go. I think these little tabs are great for marking book chapters...put probably not much else. But overall, I would just stick with the blank tabs and number them myself.

The tabs are reusable, but the problem with that is that they are not very sturdy.

I have to say that I feel silly writing up notebook tabs.

The tabs themselves are plastic upon which paper pre-numbered labels have been attached before you get them.
