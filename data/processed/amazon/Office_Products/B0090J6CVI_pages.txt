The pages don't slide very easily and they come off without warning. I thought it would be nice to take pages out and re-arrange them in a better order. And once the pages are worn it does not work as well. The wide-ruled pages should not wear from constant use. The pages are neatly perforated along the left margin in case you want a straight edge without the ring holes. Though there are many pages to the notebook, it is organized in a simple but efficient manner. All the pages and accessories have mushroom-shaped holes along one edge, and those holes slip over the lip of the binder-ring-wheel thingies. At first I thought the pages were likely to come loose, but after carrying this thing around in a bag for a few weeks I can say it holds itself together pretty well. Sometimes when one flips through the pages, the paper folds and starts to come loose from the binder. The pages themselves are wide-ruled and one nice page feature is the inclusion of a date space at the top of every page. I also like that the pages are scored so that when I remove them from the notebook, I can remove the "holes" on the side of the page that hold them into the notebook. Also the pages comes out a little to easy. The removable pages allow you to move the pages, dividers and pockets around the notebook. Second, the pages are wide-ruled (graph paper is also available). The pages can be detached and reattached anywhere else inside the notebook. The pages, which I thought might cause trouble as the notebook got used, still work great. The pages open and turn smoothly and don't bind on the center rings.The back cover is a large folding pocket that very securely stores any thing you can fit in it (see the product pics)Cons:Wide ruled paper.

The pages each contain a space for the date at the top, so it may be used as a journal or diary.

The pages measure 5  inches wide by 8  inches in height.All in all a very well designed and useful product.

The pages are wide ruled and thick enough that they don't bleed thru if u wanna use both sides of the sheet.
