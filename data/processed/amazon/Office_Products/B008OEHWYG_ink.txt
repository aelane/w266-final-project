The ink is rich, dark and highly pigmented. The ink outflow is a bit on the strong side.Overall, it is still a really good product. These are great for all-day everyday use.The ink is smudgeable for only a fraction of a second, and only just a little at that. The Uniball Vision Elite BLX Series Bold Point colored ink pens come in a five pack, with five different colored inks, all with a black undertone: blue-black, red-black, green-black, purple-black, and brown-black. The ink flows well, dries quickly, and doesn't smudge easily. I like how nice and thick they are and hopefully the ink will last for a nice long time:} They're very comfortable to use.I really like the ink colors. ;)The ink in these pens are dark enough for check writing, faxes, or other writing that will be copied or digitally transmitted. And the ink from these pens does not dry quickly enough to avoid messy hand smudges, whether on relatively inexpensive copy paper, fine linen paper or greeting cards of heavier weight. I get tired of writing with black ink and it rare that you can find a blue ink pen. The ink is not waterproof but after it dries it is quite water resistant. I would describe the ink colors as Rusty Red, Forest Green, Dusky Plum, Earthy Brown and Midnight Blue. I am a bold black ink kind of gal and don't much like other colors for my writing. The coloured ink is a new bonus, but the Uniball product is uniformly of excellent quality. The ink is longer lasting than average, and the pen has sufficient thickness to allow those with poor coordination (which I have) to grasp it without difficulty. The ink glides across the paper effortlessly. The ink is infused with black ink and the only pen where I noticed the black was in the red ink: each time my pen changed direction there was a dot of black.The weight of the pen is nice, the ink flows smoothly, and the ink colors are rich and intense. These are advertized as 'BLX Black Infused Colors' which really just means they've added black ink to the normal pen colors. The ink flowed evenly with no blobbing or light/thin spots.I don't see these pens as anything all that special. The ink dries fairly quickly on paper, so my left handed daughter really likes these, and she is always looking for pens like this for her. Here's why:Despite the heavy ink flow the ink coverage is not always even. They have better ink coverage & dry faster. They are black ink with an overlay of colored ink. I can't stop for a second without ink soaking the paper. black ink mixed in with each color. The ink itself is something special. If the ink is allowed to dry, there is almost no smearing of the ink.Cons:Ink tends to wick in cheap paper: The cheap copy paper most offices use has a tendency to wick the ink. In particular, the ink makes a deep impression on the page, so your writing will clearly stand out - these would be good pens with which to sign greeting cards. The ink colors are really beautiful. That the ink goes deep to prevent possible check washing is certainly a plus. The ink is a great color, but in some paper, it can soak through. The ink flows great! Now however, they do not write as smoothly, the ink flow is inconsistent and it appears ink gathers at the tip so the first time you write (after say a day of letting the pen sit), you get a slight glob of ink. What I like the most is that they are very easy to use and the ink flows easily allowing very fast writing yet with good style. Be aware that the ink takes a few moments to dry, so if you drag your hand across the paper right after you write on it, it will smear! The ink's color is indicated at the lid's tips and also the ends of the pens.Features -  I like the bold, rich color that's made possible by the pigment based gel/inks. I initially thought there were three black ink pens, one dark red, and one dark green. The ink is definitely purple or green or red, but it's a legible color that's easy on the eyes. They read just as easily as a traditional black or blue ink.Generally, the ink flows pretty smoothly when writing in smooth, flowing strokes, as one does with cursive, for example. And the ink doesn't appear black as a result; the colors are what their names suggest, but with a moderate saturation instead of gaudy brightness.The pens themselves are very comfortable to use. I'm not sure about the Airplane Safe ink as I haven't used these on a plane, but I do love the way these pens write.
