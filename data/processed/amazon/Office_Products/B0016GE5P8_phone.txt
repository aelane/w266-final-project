I tested the phone walking about 100+ ft down the hall to the end of the building, and even though there were a number of walls, and concrete obstructions, I was able to hold a uninterrupted crystal clear conversation -- Unbelievable! I chose this phone from the Vine program because I needed a new one for my kitchen that didn't have to plug into a phone line. This is handy because if the phone "walks off" you know where it needs to go back to!The display is very clear and the blue background easy to read. Overall, I recommend this to those looking to upgrade to a nice phone set for their home that will look good and meet all their needs. So I should love this phone. The phone takes awhile to reset after a call so you can't just hang up and hit redial, for instance, or you get the message "incomplete data." The phone comes with numerous ring tones, but almost all of them sound like a 70's video game and only  one (the first one) was pleasant sounding and sounded like a phone. For me, however, that blue light takes this phone from a solid 4 1/2 stars to about a 3 1/2, even at this price.UPDATE 5/19/08 -- well, according to my friends it doesn't sound all that great. They're always very happy when I switch to my Uniden phone. At last we can use the phone and the microwave at the same time! I am quite happy with this new Dect 6.0 phone from GE.Upgrading from and older 2.4 GHz was a revelation. This is a decent phone set with lots of bells and whistles. My previous 5.8GHz phone seemed to work just fine.I use this set with my Vonage line and fortunately, I have no complaints on call quality. However, if what you're looking for is a phone that delivers quality sound, it may be worth putting up with the negatives, because the set does deliver quality sound.UPDATE: December 2, 2008Two phones is not enough for the average household, but the quality of sound of these phones is so good that I have purchased additional phones for the house. I couldn't think of a better phone for the price. I've never been happier with a phone in my life. For all of that, this phone and the second handset it comes with does the job well enough.The handsets have the time in large numbers when they are in their base unit(s) charging which is a nice feature. That's basically all I need to know about a phone and all I want to know about a phone. This phone is one of the best cordless phones on the market! Now this is not major, as we all know where the 1-2-3....4-5-6..7-8-9....*-0-# are on the phone. You can leave one phone in a room (not in use), go somewhere else in the house, and with your other phone click on "monitor room extension" and you will hear what is going on in the room the other phone is! And they do not have to be near each other (the other phone chargers).The phones light up bright when they ring.

It also seems to lose stored phone numbers and likes to ignore my time changes.

This phone also seems to lack a vibrate option.One of our biggest complaints is that it takes a three to four rings *before* caller ID comes up.

We can't explain why they're so slow to process CallerID (another similar phone system we use is virtually instant on that front, so it's not the service or lines), but that has quickly become quite annoying.
