I too own a Deskjet D1660 printer. However if this printer ever COMPLETELY fails and I can no longer print, you better believe I'm coming here and changing my rating to 1 star. It's like the printer doesn't know which page you're referring to and gets confused and stuck. After it finds my printer number a message says "Out of stock" for black ink cartridges. This has been the best printer yet. Give the printer time, and it will serve you well. Now that I have written this, the printer may die tomorrow. You may be happy at first but I promise you EVERYONE says this printer is a dud BIG time, including me.

Will this printer solve all of your printing problems?

I have since used it as the primary printer for my laptop (on my third ink cartridge) since it is small enough to be portable.

Sometimes, you just need to walk away and give the printer a chance (sometimes a loooooong chance.)
