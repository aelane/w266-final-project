And the tab size worked great for me. I do like the expanded tab size but I am not thrilled with the weight of the paper used in these folders. Not too much to write about - the larger tab is a nice feature, and the materials from which these folders are made seem to be as good or better than the stuff you'll pick up at a typical office supply store. Except... there is a large tab. I'll buy more...What I really, really like about both is the super tab....No more tiny type to get it all on the tab.... Absent the additional tab area, these folders would rank as average overall, but the extra large tabs are enough for me to give this product an above average rating and a recommendation. Plus the tab is larger so you can have more information on the label for the folder. The bigger tab solves that. Not really.These are identical to my usual tab folders, except that the cut out below the tab goes farther down the folder. The tab is not higher (this is a good thing since that would cause the tabs to hit the drawer above when you closed the drawer). First of all, the super tab idea is a long time coming. The enlarged tab is very useful for labeling or for those of us who prefer write on the tabs but do so in large handwriting. The tab on these is big, it extends 7/8" above the edge of the folder, but it is not so super. But to do this, and still have the larger tab, the height of the non-tab portion of the folder is lowered. Making a larger tab doesn't seem like rocket science, but for someone with a slight to moderately severe vision problem, these little things are VERY important. The tab is 1/3 as wide as the folder itself and deeper than regular tabs. How they make the tab larger is by making the overall height of the folder a bit lower. The tab itself reaches to the same height as other tabbed folders but the folder itself is a bit shorter by 1/4 inch.
