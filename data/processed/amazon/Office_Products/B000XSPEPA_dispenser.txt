The Scotch Pop-Up Tape Hand Band dispenser is a terrific gadget, it eliminates the hassle of wrapping Holiday gifts. Sometimes the entire dispenser would snap back and hit my fingers/wrist - OUCH!!! This dispenser comes with pre-cut tape strips. This dispenser is handy, attractive and useful. Also, they will need to be replaced with a special dispenser replacement package. This particular dispenser has been redesigned a bit. You simply slide the dispenser door open, insert the tape with the tab up, and slide the door closed. The dispenser has a band that allows you to slide the dispenser over your hand and use the other hand to remove the pre-cut pieces of tape. But other than that we really like this dispenser as it speeds things up, and makes wrapping easier in general. You simply attach the dispenser to your non-dominate hand and then grab the small strips of tape which are popped up out of the middle when you need them. The dispenser has a wide piece of elastic on the bottom that slips over my hand. The dispenser has raised edges so that the tape can easily be unstuck when it is time to use it again.Also, I find that keeping this dispenser in a small ziplock snack bag keeps it from getting dirty or icky in case someone throws it in a drawer or drops it on the floor, etc. The dispenser itself is nice when wrapping because the tape is secured firmly on your hand, which makes it quick and easy to use. I found the little wrist-held dispenser far better than a table based one--not the least of which was because of 3Ms idea that the tape comes out in 2" strips--you don't have to tear it off a dispenser.Simple changes, but it streamlined the process of taping something. It is clear they are using the dispenser as a loss-leader to get you hooked on the refills. You simply strap the dispenser to one wrist and when you've folded the paper into the spot where you want it to stay..pull a strip from your wrist and stick it in place. I really like this dispenser. The dispenser is a convenient way to deliver pre-cut pieces of Scotch Tape. I was dubious about this dispenser, but having gone through all my Christmas wrapping I am definitely a convert. This dispenser is perfectly suited for that purpose. If you have tape dispenser, it's not worth having popup tape. I prefer the heavy-weight dispenser over the popup tape dispenser. Loading this dispenser is not that easy. The Scotch dispenser alleviates that problem. My dispenser came in a hot pink color, one of my favorite colors. The dispenser came with one pad, which was gone in a flash. This dispenser has a rubber band that fits it over your hand so it just takes one hand to pull off precut tape strips. This dispenser works as intended, but gets in the way during use, requires product-specific refills, and is only a little more effective than a desktop tape dispenser.I used this dispenser wrapping some of my this season's gifts, and found it got in the way while worn on my hand or knuckles (as recommended)-- I wasn't able to manipulate the partially-wrapped gifts very well one-handed. The Scotch PopUp Tape Handband dispenser fits comfortably on your hand, giving you full movement. Loading the dispenser is a snap and takes seconds.The only problem I have with this product is that the refill packs are a pain to find in brick & mortar stores. This dispenser is such a design. So far so good.The dispenser loses on two minor points and one big one. Scotch Pop-Up Tape Handband dispenser is a very easy to use time-saver. PopUp Tape is a dispenser that puts tiny rectangles of tape at your fingertips, while (and this is the best part) you wear the dispenser on your wrist with a built-in elastic band. Maybe I would consider buying her a pop-up dispenser once a year for this occasion. I tried this new dispenser just at the tail end of my Christmas gift wrapping this year and what a difference! The dispenser is light weight with an elastic band that you can use on your wrist, hand or knuckles. Thankfully, the dispenser is refillable, but I would recommend purchasing additional tape sets or that Scotch package more refills in with the dispenser. The dispenser goes around your hand or even further down around the knuckles, and you're ready to go.My gripes: I don't know if I got an old batch of tape strips, but a lot of the strips had something sticky on them, like the rubber stuff on the back of new credit cards.

This is pretty much exactly what it appears- a little dispenser that you wear on the back of your hand that dispenses tape, one 2inch piece at a time.

This dispenser is heavily weighted so you can easily pull tape with one hand and you can even select the proper length of tape.Sorry folks.

As the dispenser is attached to the hand that's hold the wrapping paper, I can use my other hand to quickly yank off a piece of tape and apply it.
