This stapler is lightweight and fits comfortably in your hand. I wouldn't recommend using this stapler for securing items on a wall or bulletin board, but for every day office use it certainly gets the job done. All in all this stapler rocks and is recommended without reservation. It is very light and absolutely the best stapler I ever had. This stapler is unlike any stapler I've used. The stapler can also sit on a desk the regular way, or you can invert it and have it standing up.The main advantages to this stapler are the ease of use and number of pages it can staple. I bought this stapler because I wanted a something that could staple more than a regular stapler without getting jammed of bending the staples incorrectly. The stapler can easily staple 30 sheets of paper and still keep them bound. With every other regular stapler I've used, the more sheets of paper you staple, the harder you have to press on the stapler.
