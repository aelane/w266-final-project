It contains isopropyl alcohol.The eraser is pretty good at erasing recent writings but not as good if you are erasing things that have been on the board for weeks. To put it differently, if the Quarter eraser drops on your toes, you may not even feel it.The package is easy to open with your hands, and if you do this gently, you can use the packaging to store any unused items in there (eg the spray bottle or some of the markers). The eraser is not the quality that I had expected, but it does the job. The eraser is a typical eraser but the markers are chisel cut which made nice thin lines. The eraser is sort of lame, however. The eraser does well, though it wouldn't erase something that was on the board for months without first using the spray cleaner, but it did the job (with some quite amusing squeaking too). I used both the eraser included an another eraser that I have and the marker smeared (left light streaks). This was worse with the eraser included, but still has a light streaking with another eraser. and the eraser provided cleans up my whiteboard surfaces when we are done. Usually the eraser is enough but when the board gets a little too messy the spray cleaner does its job well too. The eraser works fine, just let the marker ink dry for a few seconds before erasing or it will tend to smear. The dry eraser removes most of the dried &#34;ink&#34; but leaves &#34;ghosts&#34; behind. The eraser works very well, which means  you won't have to use the cleaner that often.If you have a Quartet board or something similar, this is a must accessory to get. I haven't had an eraser for a while, and have used tissue, and the eraser does a nice job of cleaning the board, as well. The eraser is better quality than my old EXPO one, it has better density. The eraser is just OK but the spray cleaner works really well. The eraser also functions well, and doesn't seem to shed ink dust like others I have used in the past.Overall, a great set of markers, and ones I would recommend.Disclosure:Obtained From: Amazon Vine Review ProgramPayment: Free The eraser is fine and serves it's purpose.

First, I used the eraser to get as much of the old stuff off that I could but some of the older (more stubborn) markings were still there.

And eraser is functional if a bit flimsy.

It isn't the eraser.
