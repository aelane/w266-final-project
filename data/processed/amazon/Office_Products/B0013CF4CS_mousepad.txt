I always found myself moving either the mousepad or bean bad to reposition it since they slid around constantly.This mousepad is quite smaller than what I am custom to using. The 3M mousepad stays in place, the non-skid backing prevents it from sliding around. Decent mousepad, the wrist support does feel a bit more comfortable compared to the usual flat ones. At 8-3/4" in length the mousepad already seems small. The mousepad has enough weight and traction that it'll stay in place. I've had a traditional flat mousepad for years. As a mousepad, my expectations from this product are very simple:- Let me use mouse w/o any pointer delays on the display- smooth operation- Wrist support.This product provides all three of the above. Do you chew on your mousepad?

I don't always bring a mousepad, but the comfort level is enough that I remember to bring it along.So for the specific use with a smaller mouse and it's very durable, clean feel and wrist comfort, I highly recommend it.

I have been using a regular mousepad with a bean filled wrist bag to support my wrist for a long time.
