Well, just what CAN one say about a cardboard box? I was worried that because they are cardboard packed in cardboard they would arrive damaged, but they arrived in great condition.These were super easy to set up, there was no need for the included instructions. The cardboard is thicker, and they would definitely not get as beat up as the Banker's Boxes if you are moving them around a lot. This is truly the Rolls Royce in the cardboard box realm. We have to flatten our cardboard boxes before placing in the dumpster. they are a pretty sturdy cardboard for one, and we are using them for moving. Like, what can be said about a cardboard box? Well, as it turns out, not all cardboard boxes are the same. They are made of sturdy cardboard with handles on the sides and large areas for writing in the contents. The regular cardboard boxes that you can get from your local retail store are the most obvious and cheapest solution, but those are not the most convenient to carry around, and often come damaged in some way. The cardboard is sturdy and thick and you won't have to worry about the bottom falling out...unless you're filling it to the brim with heavy books maybe. When you re-use typical cardboard boxes, you do not have re-tape the bottom each time.Cons* If you will be storing things in boxes and then going back over  a period of time to add or remove items, these may not be the best choice. They are a medium-weight cardboard, and I would not place heavy objects in them, such as mechanical parts, heavy electronics, books, etc. I was able to set up my first one without consulting the instructions.The cardboard feels a bit soft, so I wonder how well it will stand up in humid environments, but the initial strength is certainly enough to handle as much weight as I can comfortably lift in one box.At the price being offered when I write this, I would call these boxes a worthwhile investment for moving or for short-term storage. Okay, I thought, cardboard boxes, whoop-dee-doo. Who would have thought that a cardboard box could be so important! These are well made cardboard boxes that are a step up from the moving boxes available for purchase at Uhaul. Previously, I always salvaged corrugated cardboard boxes that I could find, e.g. Why would one pay $44.99 for six cardboard boxes when one can just go dumpster-diving for the same thing? They also have convenient cardboard lid locks to ensure they don't just open.Now for the move...there is still some time until we do that but planning ahead by using these boxes will certainly make the process easier. They are a nice, heavy-duty corrugated cardboard with a double layered bottom. The cardboard is very sturdy - this is no wimpy product. Fellowes makes a superior cardboard box, and the prices are on the high side, but well worth it, if you like making moving easy. There are double thick cardboard sides and also on the bottom for sturdiness. These are heavy cardboard, made to hold up!Right now I'm using them for storage, but these are what you want for moving! I work with cardboard boxes 6 days a week so I am hard to impress but these really do make it simple to do while providing a thick, solid environment for your items.W
