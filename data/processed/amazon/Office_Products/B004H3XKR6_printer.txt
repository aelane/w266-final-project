I ordered this printer to replace aCanon PIXMA MP780 All-In-One Photo Printer, which has served me well for several years but was not network capable. One can do it from the printer touch screen, but that might be pretty clunky when entering the passwords. This worked great from Windows 7, but on Windows XP I had to manually go to the printer, turn over the paper, and put it back in the paper tray! The printer starts up fairly rapidly, and the print speed is very good for an inkjet - I believe the advertised 15 or so PPM, about half that in duplex.Touch screen with color interface. The printer comes with the larger capacity cartridges, but one does have to use a lot of ink when the printer is first turned on, as it primes the printer. When I first setup the printer I was unable to print - because I had not filled in the smaller upper tray. I can't fault the printer, but I'm glad that traumatic experience is over (why can't everyone just switch to scanning+email? The printer drivers are not up on Windows Update, so you need to install them from the included disc. The printer also supports being installed as a shared printer, but the best way is just to connect to it independently as a network printer and make the drivers available on each machine on the network.The software is decent enough, but definitely includes some bloatware (like installing a toolbar in Windows Explorer). This printer has been the family's go-to all-in-one for a number of months.Why?++ easy wireless setup++ two sided printing. The printer looks like a professional office machine with its two paper trays and automatic document feeder. Lastly, I'd like to mention that the printer comes with the extra high capacity ink cartridges in the box and not small "starter" cartridges, which is a nice touch.As far as connections are concerned there are phone line inputs, USB, and Ethernet connections on the rear. The printer also has built-in Wi-Fi and I was able to connect to my secured network easily and quickly.The features of the Epson are tremendous. The printer functions as a copier, scanner, photo-printer, and fax, all of which can be done in color. The printer does have a "quiet mode" that you can access through the computer, but I didn't notice a difference in sound level.All in all... a workhorse of a printer that doesn't disappoint.If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment and I will reply as soon as possible. This printer is so great, I can't believe it. Don't hesitate, this is the printer to end all printers. And it's also very quiet compared to any other printer I've had before. This printer is simply top-drawer in every way, both for personal and small or home office use.The quality of the unit is pure Epson all the way: well designed, small footprint for a unit with such capabilities, easy to use and operate, well thought-out controls, fast output, and great prints of both documents and photos.I really like the fact that it can print two-sided documents.Its wireless capability is also a very useful feature, allowing all the computers on a wireless network in your home or office to use the same printer, provided each computer has the printing software installed. The printer will not recognize an incorrect paper size. I've been using it as my primary printer and don't notice the ink rapidly reducing like I did with my HP.-Wireless setup was easy. You can get to the printer from its IP address, but it only gives you basic options and status.Overall, this is a printer for consideration. It is the best printer I've ever owned. Ok this printer has been used in a business setting for just under two years now and shows no signs of stopping. So imagine how happy I was to get this wi-fi capable printer!Yes, this means that now I can have my computer in the living room and keep my printer in the bedroom. I love this printer! I installed this printer on a Windows XP system using  a USB cable. The printer does not come with a cable. Just unpacking the printer takes about 15 minutes hunting down all the spacers and cardboard and plastic and tape that has been put in every nook and cranny to protect it during transport.The printer is quiet. I don't know why it does that.This printer is extremely fast!The printer is economical on ink. (The printer box claims that it comes with extra-high capacity ink, although I haven't run out of ink yet to say how long the cartridges last.) I've got an HP Laser printer as my go-to printer for monochrome text output. Accessing the printer using Snow Leopard's built-in software, by the way, didn't work. Although the printer was there on the network, I wasn't able to access the many capabilities of the Epson without actually installing their software.Speaking of the network, the Epson 840 has wifi built in. This is wonderful as it means the printer doesn't have to be anywhere near your workspace and can easily be shared by all family members. ThisEpson WorkForce 840 Color Ink Jet Wireless All-in-One with Fax (C11CA97201)printer was definitely user friendly on set-up. My old printer required an external wireless print server. The printer prints fast and the prints are laser-like in their quality.Because I am a teacher, I use this thing to print homework packets and other worksheets for my students. Recently I bought a Canon Pixma because I wanted a printer that had sheet feeding capability. Fortunately, it got far enough to where I was able to add the printer using the Windows 7 utility and everything works perfectly. Summary: I am very happy overall with this printer. All I have to say is this printer installed in mere minutes on both my Windows 7 PCs and also on all of my Macbooks. Eventually I just cancelled it and checked for the printer manually. An Add printer box will open.7. It is cynical to say that the printer supports OSs when it requires that you take extra steps for faxing and scanning, and when it does not work for printing. I have been using this 840 printer in my home office for a few years ago and it still works great. I you want a printer that could do it all, this is it. This printer looks like an workgroup or office printer and performs like one. Actually, it works better than the printer where I work. The printer detects all the available network and give you a list. Best printer I ever had. Great all around printer! I have found this Epson printer to be good value for my home needs.Setup was easy - I just followed the directions. I've been very happy with this printer, my first Epson after years of using HPs. I bought this printer to replace an ink hungry epson that I had. Overall and excellent printer. This is the fastest printer I have ever owned. On my old printer it does degrade.So this brings me to the Quality issue. I purchased this printer because it had 2 paper trays that both held at least 150 sheets. I've had this printer for over1 year now and it has been a real workhorse. The printer gaveme an error message saying I did not put the inks right first time, then Ipushed the inks further down to hear a louder click.Wireless setup was also easy and worked right away. The printer scanned andshowed all the available networks, but mine was hidden, and I was easilyable to put the network name and password manually. And on my Mac the printer showed up as shareddevice (memory slots and usb), so I was able to transfer files back andforth. I highly recommend this printer, be consumer should consider alloptions before purchasing. This is the printer for you. If you are thinking about getting a new printer, I'd say definitely go with the Epson's - they just work better, last longer and have more reliable drivers, and whether you want the workforce or artisan model, really depends on what you are printing - for better pictures or ability to print cd's, the artisan would be the better choice - but it's ink is more expensive, too. I put the printer through the paces by printing 6 copies of a mock document (which simply contains the pangram "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" repeated 145 times). I chose this printer based on it's all in one functionality, wireless capabilities and dual trays.---Print---I have two trays to choose from. You can set the printer up wirelessly or with a USB cable. Plus you can print double-sided without having to refeed the printer! This is by far our favorite printer. I would have never thunk it, but having a Wireless printer is just fantastic. I'm at.SETTING up the printer was super easy. I connected the printer wirelessly to my network, and my Windows Vista machine found it easily as the software installed. Epson just fixed it for free by sending him a newly refurbished printer. This is my new favorite printer! This all-in-one printer is a beast. The printer was quickly and easily discovered on my network, and setting up the Fax was equally simple.Two paper trays take up the bulk of the space on this printer. This printer is definitely aimed at office work: Text, charts, faxes, copies, and OCR on scans... And it handles all these tasks admirably, and is surprisingly quiet for a printer this size.The card slot handles XD, SD, Memory Stick Pro and Compact Flash. Ink has gotten quite affordable, and the printer handles my workload like a pro. I have been using this printer for about a month now and I am really happy with it.I have been through quite a few all-in-one/multifunction printers in my life and I can say this is probably the best inkjet version I have ever used, also probably the heaviest, which makes me think it is going to be with me for a long time. The first printer I have ever had that came with that function. I love this printer. It lets me put the printer anywhere I want. Put the printer anywhere you want!- Fast two sided printing- Printer is kinda big- Scanning is easy. Well it's big, heavy, and it's not the cheapest printer out there.Overall, I definitely recommend the Epson WorkForce 840 I turned to Epson to replace a printer that I accidentally pulled off of a shelf because the wires were connected! Too big/much printer for personal use (more suitable for home office or small business)3. This printer was very easy to setup out of the box. Will have to see how this holds up.Printing is pretty fast, our current printer is an all in one by Brother that is 2+ years old and this unit prints pages in seconds.It is very easy to set up wifi or usb connections - the touch pad on the front of the unit is easy to use (but needs strong pressure as noted above) and pretty self-explanatory.It's a great unit that does the job quickly. Installing the printer cartridges was a snap.In comparing the printer interfaces, the Lexmark touch screen seems to be more responsive than the WorkForce 840 and of a higher quality. Very simple and it's nice that you don't need to set the printer up with a static IP address (this makes it easier to setup and user friendly for non-IT people).Printing is also simple, of course. In the printer's drivers, you can set it up for automatic two sided printing to conserve paper or you can set it up for one time two sided printing if you so prefer. If you connect the printer to the computer via a USB cable, you cut down job transit time and it takes about 15 seconds to print. This printer, like the Lexmark, lacks one feature that I would like to see included. This is quite annoying and if you're buying a printer mainly for photo printing, buy a photo printer instead. Setting up the printer is easy, so one would assume setting up the fax capability is just as easy. When the printer is installed, it includes a device in Windows 7 that you can double click on and create your fax right at the PC. This sleek, attractive printer is a great product for a great price. The printer makes all these conversions for you, apparently.

Glitches everywhere, including the printer's console that no longer allows me to choose certain options I once could before (they're literally just not there anymore).

@highlight

I still can't scan to a Mac from the printer, and there's still no way to permanently set a specific tray.One thing that is worth noting though: getting the printer going on my Mac took no effort at all.

Under the printer list, select the + key.6.
