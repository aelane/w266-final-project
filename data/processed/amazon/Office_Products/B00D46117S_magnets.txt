The magnets are strong and should indeed stand up to any locker slamming you can throw it at. These magnets hang tight, you can slam this baby shut and it is right were you left it, when you open her up. The magnets on each corner hold very nicely, too. The magnets on this are wonderfully strong - I actually have it on my front door, and it hasn't budged even a little. The magnets are very strong, the profile is slim and pens and my iPhone (even with the silicone case on it) fit snugly in the pockets. The magnets are super-strong (this thing stays put!) The magnets claim to be slam resistant so that the storage pouch does not fall. The magnets on the back of this stick well. The magnets look like they will stay on- they are strong and secured well to the neoprene fabric. It also has 4 strong magnets on the back of it for mounting which makes it great for locating it on a metal door, filing cabinet or refrigerator.The pockets are small. The magnets held well and it didn't slid down with the weight. The magnets are strong, well too strong. I pulled it out to put it somewhere else and the magnets popped off and stayed attached to the fridge. The magnets have real power! The magnets are really strong and keep this stuck to whatever metal you have this stuck to. The primary one is that that magnets are strong. It is well made, and the magnets are super strong. The magnets are pretty strong and it keeps the pocket in place very nicely. I have just superglued the magnets back into their sockets, but I no longer have confidence in the make of this product.
