Another innovative and very useful product using Scotch Tape. I would think that this would be an awesome product for the elderly, who often have trouble manipulating smaller items, or children who would like "their own tape dispenser". But if you are looking for a product that makes wrapping presents and things easier, it's a convenient product. Overall, this is a great product that any person will find useful. this product did very well on all three surfaces.As far as loading the Handband it was quite easy to do, and the length of the strips (2")was a perfect length for all of my needs. I definitely recommend this product! Luckily it seems to be a fairly strong product, otherwise it just might have broken while I was fighting with it. This is a good and useful product. I received this product just in time for Christmas gift wrapping and was it ever handy. I received this product through the Amazon Vine program. I was lucky enough to receive this product for review just prior to my holiday gift wrapping, so it's been fun to put the two styles of dispensers contained in this packet through their paces. I like this product, it saved me having to stop several times while wrapping  a package to pull off a piece of tape. As soon as I received this product I put it right to work! Why is this product so awesome? Wrapping seems easier with this product, but tape is tape, and Scotch Pop-up Tape is useful for any taping imaginable. I am also using this product during crafting time with my son, which has also served quite useful.Overall, this package offers what seems unlimited supply of tape, is easy to use (my four-year old is also a pro at using it), is truly expedient, and is certainly worth the purchase. Its a good product that offers a lot of convenience for the slightly higher price. This product was wonderful to have on Christmas Eve as my husband and I stayed up wrapping presents. This product solves both problems.And, just in time for holiday gift wrapping, this package includes 2 dispensers you wear on your hand. So this product, after some study, laid to rest some of my "economics" concerns.

If you do, however, this product works very well.

This product should be useful for basic home and school needs.

This product is a solid value, especially around the Christmas season.The problem with some of these pre-cut tape thingies is that you get a dispenser and one tape, and you overpay for replacement tapes, often when you run out unexpectedly at an inopportune time.
