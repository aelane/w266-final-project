In general, though, I think for a reusuable folder, it makes more sense to go with the double-thickness tab style folder instead of a heavyweight single.But these are far superior to the bargain bin lightweight file folders, so if you're a GTD fan and like a big stack of plain folders, these are a good choice. Yes, they are wider, but they also go down the folder farther (the cut away indent of the front folder piece goes deeper than on regular manila folders). Heavy-duty folder actually help solve those difficulties.So grab some of these today. This allows the folder to hold larger amounts more easily  (I've done this with some very full folders). You might think a folder is a folder, but these SuperTabs are built to last. I typically use a yellow folder for actionable items that need extra handling, but aren't quite as time sensitive. The blue folder is always always always my personal files, especially in a busy work office - for example a copy of my time sheet, a performance evaluation, a certificate for completing a seminar or class, etc. When I saw him fiddling with my red folder while asking me a routine question, I realized he needed me to accompany him elsewhere to be briefed. It would not detract from the folder working as a base to a lapbook. The average file folder looks pretty bad after a visit or two. If you open a standard folder and you open and lay one of these folders on top, you will see that these folders are about a half inch shorter from end to end. The Smead SuperTab Heavyweight folder is one solid performer. If you sometimes can't locate a folder because its tabs are buried behind other folders or behind papers that they contain, these folders will be a great time-saver, and will increase your peace of mind. But if you, like me, frequently replace folder contents and change folder names, you want to place labels over the old tab markings. Then again, you first might want to turn a folder inside out and use the unmarked side of the tab, which is easy to do with these folders.The four colors (red, green, yellow, blue,) are helpful for organizational purposes - you could use different colors for different priority ratings, or for different kinds of projects.The colors are not too bright or garish either; in fact, they're quite tasteful.
