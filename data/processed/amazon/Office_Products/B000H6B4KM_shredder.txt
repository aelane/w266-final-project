I've been using this shredder at my office for almost a year. I wouldn't choose this shredder again. This shredder shreds what it advertises with no problems. The shredder unit sits atop the basket and the bin slides out. What can you say about a shredder other than it shreds, it hasn't broken, and it hasn't even jammed. It's a shredder. I have owned this shredder for over six years, and it has endured some heavy use. That's great for the shredder's intended purpose, but it does have a tendency to give whatever room you are using a strong resemblance to Times Square on New Year's Eve. I bought this shredder because of all the good reviews. This is a great shredder. I am not sure how long the shredder is going to hold up without some kind of reinforcement on the right side.One of my concerns with buying this shredder was the need for special bags, but I've found it works fine without buying the overpriced bags. I've now had this shredder for almost a year and I can say that it has met most of my expectations. Looking for a great shredder for home use? I've had this Fellowes PS-77Cs shredder since 2007 and it is still going strong. I would characterize this shredder as having a medium shredding capacity and once shredded, the result is 5/32" by 1 1/2" confetti. You can feed the shredder up to 12 sheets of paper at a time.The other thing I like about this shredder is its steel cutting ability which makes feeding paper with staples a cinch. The shredder stops automatically when it senses that the machine is overheated, has a jam or when the wastebasket is not securely in place.With regards to jams, I've experienced a couple of jams, but nothing so serious that requires me removing the gears.
