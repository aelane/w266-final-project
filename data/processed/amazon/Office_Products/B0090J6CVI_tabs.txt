It comes with neon tabs plus two lined sticky notes that make it handy for list making. Divider tabs makes it easy to divide the paper into different sections of your choosing. brightly colored sticky tabs which are loud enough that Helen Keller couldn't miss them.I suppose if you're a chick on the go who likes to be able to toss a note book into her purse, this is an ideal set up. Sticky tabs and flags: great for highlighting something I want to come back to or adding an additional note to a page that's already filled.3. These tabs are made of the same material as the cover, and are three different colors:  Maroon, navy blue, and black.The back cover matches the front cover but it has a fold-over that fits over the two top and bottom binder rings. It comes with 3 movable tabs that you can place as you wish. It has these removable long plastic tabs that you can reposition over and over. There are tabs to separate, sticky notes, paper, and a binder system where you can move pages from one end of the notebook to the other without any ripping. There are three big, sturdy tabs that can be used to separate parts of the notebook. And there are two tabs with sticky notes that can be used to add information to any page and then move it around. I enjoy the page-width tabs I can use to bookmark pages I want to quickly access. Unfortunately, the tabs that hold them in place are weak and easily bent and then don't allow them to be re-inserted for a new location.The file pockets seemed a big plus! There are tabs or markers that you can put anywhere in the notebook to designate sections or keep your place.
