And the seal is pretty good, but I'd still use a piece of tape for extra security. The moisture-free seal makes it more convenient and less messy for the person sealing the envelope.Despite the durability and the hassle-free sealing, the price is quite steep for 40 envelopes. They are  self seal without the annoying paper strip. The adhesive provides a strong seal and the privacy option worked well to conceal cash and a check when I tried them.These envelopes were a bit pricy and somewhat flimsy. The seal has no strip to peel off. Just fold and seal. The seal is very tight and seems very reliable. Literally just "reveal and seal!" And when you do this, you get an extremely secure seal. Also, no more semi-triangular based seal. the most significant is the tamper-evident seal which reads opened in red ink if it has been compromised. The second is the seal which does not need to be wet, and, as a consequence (more important to me) will not be destroyed by humidity,  The envelopes are sealed with something which resenmbles rubber cement. The seal is extremely strong so there's no worry about the flap opening or corners tearing. The seal is great and the whole thing is perfect! While not nearly as strong a seal as the 3M padded envelopes, the Reveal-N-Seal envelope is great for sending letters or simple mailings. But it is better than nothing.The seal does include a perforated lining which shows if the envelope has been tampered with or atempted to be opened. I don't like the self-adhesive seal. The seal is tight, clean, and secure. Doing this made a very secure seal that I wasn't able to pull up. The no-waste seal works; sticks strongly and unlike another person, I could not re-open it without tearing the envelope, even immediately after sealing.A perfectly fine product, maybe a bit pricey, and Amazon needs to pack for shipping a whole lot better than they do: my box arrived squashed and useless. The seal lasts as well.Recommended. Once sealed it appears that the seal is secure, too. Yay.The tamper-evident seal is another nice feature. Just peel back the seal part to reveal the sticky side and close the envelope. The seal on this works very well. Great envelopes with a very nice seal. There is no protective seal to pull off and discard. The seal is so strong, I can't see any way to open this envelope without leaving a very visible scar to prove you looked at the contents. These are nice self seal envelopes with the extra added security seal.
