It's a surprisingly durable binder (I have a tendency to beat mine up, and this one has survived). I think I've finally found a binder that doesn't have that problem. This binder includes two pockets as well as a plastic cover and back where you can insert your own cover and back sheet if you'd like.The label on the binder reads:  "Guarantee 1 year; never gap; lasts 10x Longer; 2 pockets; extra durable hinge; heavy duty; holds 200 sheets." When this binder arrived, it seemed a little bend out of shape. Filling this binder straightened it's shape out and it has been working well for her to keep everything in. I would say if you need to fill the binder with papers and folders, this one will work out great. Overall, it is an attractive binder appropriate for school or office use. This binder seems to be made out of fairly sturdy material, though it doesn't seem much sturdier than other binders I have. It's nice that the binder comes in a wide variety of colors, and that amazon sells them in packages of four for a very reasonable price.I doubt this binder will last forever (or 10 times the usual length of time, whatever that may be) but for now it does the job quite nicely. I have been using this Wilson Jones binder to contain a schoolbook I have that relies on a three-ring binder for its binding (loose-leaf textbooks are in high rotation at my college). I used this binder to put a set of songs in that I sing with my boys. I need a binder that won't lose its papers! So far, this binder has held steady and hasn't lost papers.The front, back, and side all have a clear plastic sleeve to put &#34;label&#34; paper in. This binder is sturdy and extremely durable. Overall, a great binder! Basically, a three ring binder is cardboard stock covered in plastic, with hinges so that it bends where it is supposed to. This is a relatively well made binder but I have trouble seeing it as heavy duty. A binder is pretty much a binder. The binder boasts that it holds 200 sheets, which is standard for a one inch binder. I've been using this binder to sort and keep track of receipts for the holidays. Additionally the binder cover and back are nicely constructed and should stand up well over the years with average use. If you are willing to invest a little more upfront then this binder may be a good choice for you. This binder has two pockets and you can label the front and back cover and spine. The binder is good, but nothing to get too excited about.And yes, you'd better love purple. Currently using this binder for some standard 3-hole office documents. This binder has extra strong, reinforced hinges to prevent tears and separation. This is a good, tough binder that will withstand years of heavy duty use. This is a great binder. That being said, it's as good as any other binder you could get, so you can't really go wrong with this one.Update:  Well, after putting it to the test for school (I had to put a large loose-leaf textbook into it), I've found that the rings don't want to stay closed. It's your basic binder. This binder can hold a great deal of material, and will last for a long time. I use binder to organize my house, business, homeschool, photos and just about anything else I have to keep track of. I need to be able to see the binder on the shelf and not have stuff hidden away in a cabinet.So I use a lot of binders. This binder does look and feel more sturdy than other binders I have used. It's overall a superior binder so I recommend it if price is of no object. Nothing special about this binder-- I'm not sure where they're coming up with a claim about it lasting 10 times longer or having an &#34;extra durable hinge.&#34; In my lifetime, I've probably used more than 200 binders and can only remember having one tear at the hinge, so I didn't know this was a problem.It has O-rings, not D-rings (D-rings hold more), and clear plastic pockets on front and back so you can put in your own personal cover. This is a normal binder. If not, then just get any other binder you find. This Heavy Duty Binder is strong and durable, probably much more than needed for a 1&#34; binder. This is a functional binder, but it doesn't seem exceptionally strong. I compared it to a white binder of a similar size from another brand and the other had a stronger spine and lined up better. I don't know how this binder got such good reviews. The binder lines up well and otherwise appears to be well made but I think it's quite expensive for a single binder. This is a nice binder, with the rings attached to the back flap, not the spine. This is a pretty standard 3-ring binder. At present, Amazon lists this binder at almost twice the cost of a comparable Avery binder. The binder seems like a product that will continue to do its job for some time. It's a little difficult to get too worked up about reviewing a binder, but I had a specific use in mind that I thought might help others. This binder is perfect for that use in several ways. How long does the "average" binder last, anyhow? Come to think of it, I have never really had a cheap binder fall apart on me with normal use...I have some around here from high school, I think, recycled for other uses. I started using the three ring binder's again when I discovered stacks of the suitable paper in my garage.I have several of them and this is the newest, it's well built and will be a welcome addition to my office uses.The front and rear of the binder is plastic covered with slots to insert whatever I want to display on the outsides and the inside hasa good plastic rim for me to insert what ever I need to have with me.This is a great thing to have in my office that I can take with me on the go. But I'm not quite that tough on a binder, and for me, it's the rings that are the first to go.I've opened and closed this binder a bunch of times and I have to say that the ring assembly appears to be much the same as for other standard binders. Luckily, this Wilson Jones binder is one of the good ones.Back when I was teaching, I usually had the students in my classes keep a classroom notebook using a 1-inch binder. I've only used the one binder I was given for about a month now - so I really can't say that it's holding up better than one of the standard design. The binder rings don't quite line up with my three hole punched forms, it's a tighter fit that I would like. This binder eliminates both of those problems. This is a lightweight binder with a thin covering of plastic over medium weight cardboard. What can one say about a binder that isn't obvious? Overall, I can recommend this binder to anyone needing this item in this size. This Wilson Jones round ring binder has sleeves on the front, back, and spine plus pockets inside the covers. Still a decent binder for most uses. When I selected this binder I did so because I was in one those moods (that don&#8217;t last long) to organize some of the paper receipts that I still keep even though I have one of those &#34;neat&#34; scanners that is supposed to simplify your paper life&#8230;right. It seems like it will help the binder hold up to frequent openings and closings.3) There are pockets in the inside-front as well as a see-through layer above the cover, so you have space for storing papers in a variety of ways.Overall I think it's pretty much a solid choice for your average school binder. I was going to use this binder for the office but I might just leave it at home. for not that great of a binder? When you're looking for a sturdy binder to put some documents or other loose papers, this is a nice storage spot to organize them. I felt that once in the binder, they were safe to stay in one spot.It's not a flimsy binder so is perfect for longer use. This binder by Wilson Jones is one of those. This is really quite a nice binder. When my Wilson Jones binder arrived, it had a gash in the clear plastic cover. The binder itself doesn't feel as high quality as a heavy duty binder I own made by Avery, but they do honor their warranty with little hassle. This is your typical three-ring binder. * The binder has a short, clear pocket on the inside of each cover, front and back, which will hold a few extra papers.CONS:* I wouldn't call this binder "Heavy Duty" or "Extra Durable" as the title claims. I haven't even used the binder or taken it anywhere, yet it somehow managed to get pretty dinged up. I've had one main binder for a while now that held all my coupons. However I decided that I would make a separate binder for just my food and coupons.This heavy duty binder is perfect and fits my 20 plus pages of coupons no problem. I received the 1&#34; binder. This binder I will use to try to organize lots of papers I have. I've been needing a new three-ring binder and was delighted to see this offered for review in the VINES Program! This binder is okay, but doesn't seem as heavy-duty as the description says. This binder contains all of the above and to top that off, it is environmentally friendly and the three-rings are snag-free.Indeed, this is a great binder that keeps papers and other materials in one place. I've liked this binder. This is a nice binder. This is a nice binder that works well. If you've every had a binder with plastic pockets on the front, back and spine, you know that sometimes these sealed areas will start to split away and the plastic will flap loose. I haven't had this binder long enough to know if it'll go the distance that others have not, but the edge point do seem to be more strongly sealed than the average binder (this is visually indicated by the broader, deeper connections along either side of the spine). it is a little expensive though for a single binder so you'd have to weight the value of that particular strong point against a more economical option. That said, it is noticeably sturdier and tougher than any other basic binder I've used in the past. Yes!If you use a binder(s) a lot, in all likelihood you know where I'm about to go with this.If you are looking to buy one that you know will take a bit of abuse or reuse, but are pondering the possibility of getting by on the cheap, please read on!With the super cheap ones, besides the rings never snapping well, one of the big problems is corner tear where you put the inserts in.I've even used ones that tore with the first use.The clear covering is a sturdy gauge on these, and it is reinforced well. Well, this binder is definitely not worth $10. The Wilson Jones binder has two. But since it's no better than a binder that is half its cost, I give it three starts instead. Having a good binder to use is a Godsend because I can quickly find what I need. For a simple binder that you won't be using for too much it's good but heavy papers or a lot of it to fill the binder and it seems a little unsturdy. That means the binder sits on the shelf most of the time except when I take it down to pull out a recipe. This binder not only has clear view covers on the front and spine, but on the back as well, so you can give it whatever kind of look you want. I think this binder is pretty nice. The binder has two overlapping pockets inside each cover, and, given the amount of material placed in each, there could be stretching and sagging there. First, this is a decent binder.I
