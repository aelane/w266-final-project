This is literally the best tray I have ever had the pleasure of using. But it will have to do for now, I guess.Overall I highly recommend this tray, if you can tolerate the round mousepad. I mounted the tray on the underside of a pricey adjustable 48-inch by 36-inch computer desk. The tray can be adjusted up and down for comfort.The main problem was that our newer keyboard did not fit this tray because it was too big. But, I ripped my tray right out and put this welcomed addition in with ease. This tray can adjust with little effort and has a "non-locking" (can be easily adjusted without undoing a knob or lock) movement. I installed the tray onto my wood desk and I expect it to hold up well.I use a standard size keyboard, so I didn't encounter many of the problems other people experienced. Once you are done then you can push the tray back into your desk and you have the free space again.I highly recommend this product if you are a heavy computer user or for someone who has problems with your neck or back. I recommend ordering the tray that has the angle adjust as a knob on the side, this makes the tray easier to slide under the desk when not in use. I do feel I type better with the sliding tray, it makes my posture straighter, and it feels easier on my eyes because I'm a farther distance away from the screen. However, comparing this Keyboard tray to my sliding desk, the sliding desk wins hands down.

The tray fits my smaller keyboards, but the heftier ones were too big.

The tray can be adjusted to suit any typing preference.

Sturdy and reliable this tray affixes to only the strongest professional desk tables.I've had it for over a year now with no problems or complains.
