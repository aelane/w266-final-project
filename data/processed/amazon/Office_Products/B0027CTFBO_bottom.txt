The bottom and two of the four sides contain what amounts to a double layer of box material. I hate trying to grab onto the bottom of the box or even the sides to move it and constantly worried about it slipping because my grip wasn't good enough.I've packed up lots of storage stuff in the past couple of weeks and it's so nice to just grab a box, fill it up, fold down the top and go - there's no worry about finding the tape, or the scissors, OK, so you do still have to find the pen to mark the box (which if you're like me you misplaced anyway) but these boxes are super simple to use and sturdy enough that packing your prized possessions is practically worry free.The best part is, once you've unpacked your stuff, just fold the box up (assuming it's not wet or some other disaster hasn't occured to it) and you can use them again. Like those, these are easy to assemble, just unfold and push the perforated bottom section down. The bottom of these boxes is a little too weak in my opinion. )folded one I screwed up the bottom. Since the bottom of the box has no seam to open, heavy items will not drop out of the bottom when you lift the box and the hand openings make the box easier to manuever. With the Smooth Move boxes the bottom and lid are closed origami-style. The reinforced bottom folds down and locks in when you unfold the box. * The bottom is a flap-over-flap design. One bottom flap goes over another. You unfold, flip the bottom flap down, and when ready to store, the tops flips into the handles creating a locked and comfortable grip. The bottom of the box is reinforced with 2 layers of cardboard.Assembly and disassembly----------------------Assembly and disassembly is incredibly quick and easy. Fold down the final bottom flap and that's it.To seal, the tops are broken loose from the adjoining flaps, folded down square and protruding tabs tuck into the hand-holds to hold closed the top. I like that you don't need to put them together and tape the bottom. However, if needed, you could easily reinforce the bottom of one of these boxes with some tape if you were really worried that weight might be a problem.
