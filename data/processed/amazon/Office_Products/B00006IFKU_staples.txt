4 staples, but don't expect more than a couple of pages with standard staples. And even worse-when I loaded it with staples it kepts jamming. The Swingline Standard Stapler, Eco Version, accepts the staples in one long row--just as they come out of the box. It's easy to load the staples and it hasn't jammed at all. It does not come with staples, but I had some no. 4 staples and they're perfect . Now  I need to buy the staples. Holds standard staples and does the job it advertizes very well by stapling 15 sheets with ease. The staples go in easy and with little effort you can mechanically connect pieces of paper together.This unit does not come with staples you will have to get your own. It's easy to remove jammed staples and is not bad. It uses standard staples, and easily staples 15 sheets together. And they don't even include any staples.

The staples that go with the staples are just as nicely priced as this stapler itself.

When it does come open, it can cause the remaining staples to fly everywhere.On the plus side, it seems durable, is inexpensive, and because of it's muted color, won't attract any stapler stealing freaks (or SSFs) in your office.

I put staples in it, press down on it, and my papers get attached to one another.
