I purchased this printer to replace my HP. This printer was a total disappointment because Epson took HPs bad idea on paper handling and instituted it in the ARtison 835. I am very satisifed with the Epson Artisan printer. It was very easy to set up the printer and I am using it as a network printer. I tried to buy this printer locally, but Amazon's price was so much lower. I would recommend this printer to everyone. I was reluctant to buy this printer due to the negative set-up reviews i read regarding Windows 7 issues. This printer offers the highest print quality and the most features of any multifunction printer under $300. Still, overall this printer and its successor (Artisan 837) cannot be beat and would recommend it in a heartbeat if the primary user is an adult. I just got this printer yesterday. It has been the fastest printer I have ever used.
