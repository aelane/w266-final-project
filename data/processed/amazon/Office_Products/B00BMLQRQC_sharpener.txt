This is a good sharpener for home use. An OK and simple electric sharpener, with relatively weak motor compared to other models. My sharpener stopped working after 2 months. The sharpener is built well and plugs in, which are bonuses for us. This is NOT a heavy-duty sharpener. This sharpener, however, is *excellent*. This is a great sharpener. So far the sharpener is something that I will continue to use down the road and enjoy for years to come as the warranty is pretty good as well. When you use this fabulous looking sharpener, which sharpens pencils to perfection at an acceptable decibel level, make sure you do not sharpen too many pencils without emptying the shaving tray. When I put this sharpener into its new home in our home art room, my daughter sharpened every pencil she could find with it. I don't know how this sharpener would hold up in a large group setting, but for the two of us editor/writers, it's just right. This sharpener is what I would call a mid-grade sharpener. The sharpener is not real noisy, but the sound changes when the pencil is sharp, so you don't have to pull it out and check. When the sharpener is bad or mediocre, it wastes time in the classroom and takes every activity longer if someone has to sharpen their pencil or can't! This sharpener makes a fine point on good pencils, captures the shavings in a little tank (though it will spill on you if you let it overload, best to clean out every couple uses), but struggles with lower quality pencils and colored pencils -- at least my unit anyway. I would recommend this sharpener to friends and family Overall, it's a good sharpener and works well. This is arguably the best electric sharpener i have used (my previous experience being an X-Acto electric sharpener). This sharpens pencils so much better than the X-Acto sharpener. This sharpener looks and works great. The sharpener is not too noisy and makes nice sharp points. This sharpener works but leaves much to be desired. This fast and efficient grinder-style sharpener performs as advertised. Basically, a nice sharpener. This sharpener is very good in sharpening our pencils.T
