This printer was very well thought out and designed, and it's a shame that the mechanical components were not up to par. This printer has 6 color tanks and gives you very nice lab quality prints.However, I have a problem as the photos printed even on  the "best quality" setting get an extra touch of cyan color creating darker colors in pics, especially darkening skin tones. It also prints well on CD/DVDs.Features I like about this printer are:- Full color 8 inch touch sensitive LCD panel which can be angled up or down, it gives you access to all printer features and set up - simply stunning- Separate tray for photo paper. The printer was substantially discounted at $70 off normal retail. The printer is noisy as it starts up and then prints. This printer has it all. Wifi makes this printer. This new Epson printer offers a tremendous array of features for the home office. My previous printer is a Canon MP750. The printer is fast, high quality, has an SD card slot. I really like this printer. I have had this printer for approximately 2 years now. This printer is, without a shadow of a doubt, the best printer I have ever owned.As you can see from other reviews of this product, those who have it are very satisfied. This printer does it all, from photo printing to scanning, to faxing, to memory card reading. To top it off, it is a wireless printer too (although I have one issue with its implementation...see my original review below). My printer immediately pops up an error message stating that "An error has occurred. Otherwise, the new printer is working nicely.I am a bit disappointed that it only supports up to 63 characters for its circa 2005 WPA TKIP connection. To install this printer on my company laptop, I installed all of the Epson software and then configured the printer manually using TCP/IP printing in the Microsoft Add Printer Control Panel applet. I bought this printer for home use, as we needed the versatility of an all-in-one. I spent HOURS reading through various printer reviews, here and on other computer sites. I was quite impressed with the Epson printer, but it could not be connected to my home computer network, so I still used my trustyHP OfficeJet 7310 All-in-One Printer, for all of my primary photo printing, scanning and faxing. The printer itself is contained is a heavy-duty, clear plastic bag, which includes handles for pulling the printer out of the box. After sitting the printer atop the counter in my office, and after removing the protective plastic wrap and multiple tape strips that are inside and outside of the printer, I plugged in the power cord, and also plugged in an Ethernet cable coming from my Gigabit network switch in my office. After powering up the printer for the first time, the touch screen prompted me to select a location and language, and also asked me to setup things like time and date.Since I wanted to print to this device from every computer in my home, I decided to attach it to my wired network, instead of utilizing the Wi-Fi capabilities of the Artisan 800. Obviously this printer performs best with only Epson photo papers. Also, since this printer does not include a manual feed, multifunction paper input, you have to pull out the entire paper drawer, in order to reinsert your printed pages to perform manual duplex printing. Everything about this printer seems tidy, space saving, sleek and shinny. It is an excellent printer, but it really should include the duplexer (as the high-end HP printers do), and high capacity ink cartridges should be more easily accessible. I'm delighted with this new Epson printer and I highly recommend it to others. The Epson Artisan is a great all around printer!One of my favorite features of this printer is the ability to print directly onto printable DVDs and CDs. Epson has finally gotten it right with this printer. This is a great all around printer that is a great tool for someone running a small business, who needs to be able to fax from home, is a photo enthusiast, or someone that needs a good all around printer.This is the 5th Epson printer that Ihave owned and it is by far the most versatile. I love my new printer! I was impressed.But, what impressed me more is how this printer prints! My printer has printed less than 1000 pages, and when the ink pads that take the excess ink get full, Epson has it set up so that the printer shuts down and is no longer useable. Finally, I meet a printer that makes me amazed and it is the Epson Artisan 800. What I like most about this printer is its wireless capability. I can put this printer anywhere in my house and my family really likes it. And this printer does all of its jobs without connecting to a computer. I have never had any printer that leaves all my family members impressed. I heartly recommend this printer to any one who is looking for an all-in-one printer that does all the job wirelessly and flawlessly.
