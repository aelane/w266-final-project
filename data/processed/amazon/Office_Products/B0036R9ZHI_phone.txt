I'm not repeating what other have already said about the phone. Allows us to have a phone in three rooms. Our last Panasonic phone system developed battery memory effect that made it impossible to recharge the phones. One phone already needs charging after just a short amount of usage. The phone will automatically connect after pairing when the cell phone or headset is in range. I don't find the talking Caller ID that handy, the phone rings twice before it starts to announce the caller so if you have the answering machine set to pick up after 4 rings you would not have enough time to pick up. This is a great phone set. Speaker phone is loud and people on the other end of the line seem to be pleased with the sound quality.By adding cell phone bluetooth, it is like adding an extra receiver. These phone have a lot of features. And if you wear makeup, you don't have to worry about the phone getting discolored after a few uses (if you get the white model) because the hard plastic buttons are FAR better than the silicone-like ones on my old model. If you wear makeup, you can BET that the old phone would get discolored after repeated uses, and I was never quite able to get my white phone back to its original color. This phone is a lifesaver - I am shocked it took so long to get some of these features because now that I have them, I feel like I couldn't live without them. But as it stands now, it is simply incredible how far the phone has been improved in the last 10 years.Admittedly, I am new to the Bluetooth technology, so I haven't messed around any with that feature just yet.I absolutely love the range I get with this phone system. I'm sure we could go a little further, if needed.We benefitted with this phone system by adding two additional phones to place in our out-buildings... barn and shop. Our phone company is a little primative. It's not like I walk around with a phone to my ear all day.Overall, I think we're extremely happy with this set-up. I absolutely love this phone set. I love being able to block phone numbers. We're all still trying to get used to this.Overall we all really enjoy this phone set and I would HIGHLY recommend it to all.
