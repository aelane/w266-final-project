They are bright enough to show up even for the remote attendees.These pens also have a window where you can see the ink level, so you won't be surprised when your pen eventually goes dry.These pens are easy to write with and they erase easily too. These feel like pens I'd use every day. These pens work well, doesnt dry up and stay bright for weeks of daily use. The pens are smaller and sleeker, but don't seem to last long. These &#8216;found&#8217; pens too are more likely than not, also dead. These pens do what they need to - they make colorful marks on whiteboards. Great pens for writing on erasable plastic and boards. These pens really make the Expo pens obsolete. I've also found that these pens write very nicely on plastic too and still wipes off easily. Since these pens write so nicely on any surface, it really makes them very useful for quick notes where-ever you may need. I would definitely recommend these pens. She loves to bat pens off the desk and hide them under stuff.

The pens work well, they're just a little too thin for my grip.

These bold pens are incredible though.
