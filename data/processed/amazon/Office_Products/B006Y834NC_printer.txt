I am still happy with this printer after a really long time of use. This is a great little printer. No printer cords needed if you have a wireless network. It wouldn't fit on my printer stand and I had to find a new spot for it. decided to purchase a printer based primarily on price, as most home printers tend to die after a few years. This printer is plagued with problems:- Chokes on big files...prints the first few pages and then just sputters...- Routinely loses it's network settings, requiring you to re-enter them. This printer was very easy to set up. The printer is HUGE, about the size of a large microwave oven (picture the ones from the late 1970s, with the dial), and needs a lot of space on a table or desk. However, this is a well built, fully featured printer that, unless you want to print *on* DVDs, will almost definitely meet your printing needs.From using this printer these are the features which stand out:- I am able to scan very large documents. Also, even though the printer is connected to my wireless network I can still do 1-button scans directly to my PC without having to do anything on my PC first.- Two large capacity paper drawers. the printer was good to go. This will be very handy to be able to put the printer in a central location and print from the 4 PCs we have in the house.So if you are looking for a versatile all-in-one printer for heavy home use, or even in a small office or professional setting, I think this printer would be a wise choice. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this printer. I have used this printer to do everything it does and I have no complaints what so ever. It was a busy printer replacement weekend at my house! This is a HUGE printer. I absolutely love this printer and I would recommend it to anyone. While you would not buy a printer for this feature, it is an example of the well engineered approach that Epson used for this product, making it just that more useful.The thing I absolutely LOVE about this printer is its wireless capability. This printer has met my needs and exceeded my expectations.At about twice the size (and weight) of your typical desktop color printer, I had to do some creative reorganization to figure out where to put it, but once that was settled, everything went smoothly. This printer was exactly what we were looking for. We LOVE our new printer, copier, scanner. It is a fully wireless printer (WiFi, AirPrint, email print etc.) The manual that comes with the printer is decent. Given this printer is a large format printer I would have hoped for a few of those sheets, but no. The printer is FAST. It is also a very good looking printer. You can print from it to your Epson printer using the "app for that". This is a really good printer...I should mention its a massive upgrade for me like going from a Buick to a BMW so I have no real complaints. This printer was easy to set-up with a wireless network and it came with simple directions. The printer drivers are easy to install. It is not the best possible printer for any given task, but it is the best printer for the widest variety of tasks, meaning that unless I'm highly particular about a need--whether high quality or high amount of pages--this is the one that stays connected to my computer.Everything is entirely easy to use. Not even the big printer in the office will print on 11x17, much less anything bigger. *Finally, the printer is HUGE. If you load up your printer with photo paper, you could, for instance, go on vacation and have prints of your favorite photos waiting for you when you get home.If it sounds like I dismiss the printer, it's only because there's very little to be said at this point - in general, it's a known-quantity, having already owned and loved another smaller Epson. The printer itself is great, I can't find any faults for our uses. This is the very first Wide Format printer I have ever owned. I absolutely love this printer, it's fast reliable, versatile and affordable. The printer is fast, relatively quiet, and energy efficient. This printer is by far the best and easiest to use of any printer I've used at home. I love being able to store my printer in another room and simply print to it.It prints really quickly (15 B&W;/minute, 8 in color) and it has two trays that can hold a combined 500 sheets, in one of two different sizes. Overall, it's a great printer and has a lot of options for everything from printing, faxing and scanning/copying.
