The frame is nicely constructed and it has some weight to it, unlike the flimsy corkboards you sometimes see in stores. The frame is slightly larger than 1.5 inches wide (meaning more than 3 inches total space lost, when you include both sides or top and bottom). With its simple black frame it would fit into just about any decor. The black frame goes with any style and matches just about anything. And yes, the frame is wider than it appears in the photo.If you are looking for a compact, lightweight, stylish bulletin board then you will be quite happy with this purchase. The frame is well made, perhaps wider than I had anticipated, but nice nonetheless. The black frame is quite large but does give the cork board a finished look. If you're artistic, you could dress up the frame by painting on flowers, geometric designs etc. The black frame on this adds a surprising elegance (much more so than I expected). The frame around it is beautiful & very classy looking. The frame takes up a lot more space than it appears to in the product image, so the cork part is rather small.The backing and mounting pieces are pretty cheap, and the whole thing is very light; personally I'd opt for a better-quality board, though this does the job. The frame takes up a lot of the size, so the actual cork area is much smaller than 11 X 17 inches. The black frame makes the board stand out rather then just blending into the rest of the decor and looks really sharp. So that super thick black frame eats up room you could be using to pin things on this small bulletin board.

The frame easily takes up a forth of the area which is much more than the stock picture would have you believe.

With a wide 1-1/2&#34; frame, it says &#34;notice me&#34;!

I really like how the black frame around the board is nice and thick.
