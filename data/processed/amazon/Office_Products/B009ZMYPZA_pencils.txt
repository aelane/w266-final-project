Your pencils will thank you. It does produce evenly sharpened pencils. I use Prismacolor pencils to color stamped images when I create cards. I did find that some pencils took forever to sharpen. It only does this on standard #2 pencils. It also sharpens really rough on some pencils and super smooth on others. (But decently smooth on Crazy Art colored pencils. It quickly gets our pencils super sharp with barely any effort.I can clearly tell when the pencil is sharp from the distinct change in sound, though it's still relatively quiet for an electric sharpener. We plugged this in and began sharpening pencils right away. You have to wiggle or rotate pencils a bit to prevent the asymmetrical sharpening that occasionally occurs. It's very fast and sharpens pencils at a great angle--not too long or short.

Granted all the pencils were standard #2s, so I am unable to attest to the efficiency of colored pencils or harder/softer leads, but it met and exceeded our needs.

It sharpens pencils (and the instructions are very clear that it ONLY sharpens pencils.

)It takes about 20 pencils sharpened to fill the shavings chamber.
