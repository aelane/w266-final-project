The wood frame is not of the highest quality, so keep in mind the price you're paying reflects that. Close up, however, you can tell that the "wood" is basically a paper veneer. The &#34;wood finish frame&#34; is plastic. The wood is a darker finish laminate. It would have been nice if it was actual wood, but it does look nice when it arrives. It has a decently wide wood frame around it, with a nice large open black chalkboard area: it's a good value, seems nice and sturdy, especially for the price. The &#34;wood&#34; is wood laminate, and the entire design is pretty cheap. The dark wood gives a nice, rich finish that I prefer over the look of unfinished wood, often found in photography.

The wood is fake, as you should expect from an item in this price range.

The wood frame is thin and the whole chalkboard is lightweight.

The wood does not have a quality finish in my opinion, the chalkboard portion is that 'chalk board paint' stuff.
