The "sticky part" on the tabs lasts a good long time so you won't need to throw them out before you wear them out. The clear, re-usable sticky part is so transparent that you can easily read any text that it is placed over, and that clear part can also be written on too.I wish that they came in other colors besides pink and blue, but other than that....they get 5 stars from me. The part that attaches to the page is clear plastic and provides a non-glare surface through which to read. The clear part of the tabs are the perfect size for a short note, and the colored tab has plenty of room for category titles or whatever organizational label you'd like. It often did.I find the sticky part to be very durable also. The more transparent part below the colored part is much larger, and seems very durable. I started using them as part of my reminder and target day tabs in my planner. The clear part did smudge a little with pencil but not enough to be unreadable. The clear part is not 100% clear but more like scotch tape in that it is slightly cloudy but still allows you to easily read any text underneath it. The clear part (the part that has the adhesive on the back) is about the firmness of a quality index card, and the colored area is about double that firmness. While the clear part of the tabs still allow you to see what's written under them, it is a bit fuzzy.3.
