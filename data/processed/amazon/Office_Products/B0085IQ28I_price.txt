First off, this is far higher in price than even a local office supply store (it's currently $14 here on Amazon). For the price of this file box, what's the point? The price for this simple piece of cardboard that becomes a box is my foremost issue with the product. The current price on Amazon is $13.84. I have seen the price of this item fluctuate between $9.99 - $13.84. However for the price it just seems a bit silly.In my opinion its a nice product, and probably even nicer within the system its intended to be used in conjunction with.I just find it to be a touch over priced if your looking for a solo box. At the current price, plus additional cost for the box wrap, it simply isn't worth it in my opinion.This is just a cardboard box that opens up from the flat out of the packaging with the bottom automatically (and with little guidance required) interlocking and closing. As it stands, the price should be less than half what it is to be considered a bargain.Not recommended. The price is outlandish for a unsturdy cardboard box. I don't know what it is and at the price of this part of it, I am not interested in finding out.If you just need a box, even one sized to fit letter paper, there are better made, more logical, sturdier, boxes and containers out there for a much more economical price. For this price, I get one file box? I found the price to be high for only one, simple, lightweight box.Product Features* MO file case is instant organization for the desktop drawer or shelf* MO file case replaces paper piles, hanging folders and 3-ring binders* Fits in most file drawers* Holds up to 750 sheets* Use with MO Folder Kit I really can't say it is worth the suggested price. If you got three for this price, it would be worth it. The high price of the product is not warranted. It wouldn't surprise me at all if the price on this is dramatically reduced in the near future, or the quantity that you get in a package is increased to 2 or three. I guess that for the price I'd expect at least two or three boxes or at least to include the "File box wrap"I'd look at theSnap-N-Store Letter-Size File Box, Black (SNS01533)which even comes with a lid!
