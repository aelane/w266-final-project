The paper is of acceptable quality for an item you will probably discard once it&#8217;s full. The paper is heavy weight and will last. Just watch what happens when the paper is there instead of a screen.The reminders to put the date and person doing the thinking help a lot when you are busy and want to rush through. The paper is thick enough to reduce bleed/see through, and the tear-out perforations perform to expectations. The paper is very high quality, the slick cover is professional, and it's just very well thought out. Because of the thick paper, you will always use both sides, and this will probably last me a few months. The paper in this notebook is smooth, allowing my pen to glide across quickly instead of dragging like some paper does. I wish the paper was a little bit thicker because I write with a bold gel pen and there is a little bit of show-through. The paper is strong and does not tear when you erase. The paper is thick enough, but I tend to use a dark pen that shows through. BUT, the paper is extremely low density, so almost anything other than pencil or dry ballpoints will totally bleed through, making the other side of each sheet unusable. for which I still use old-fashioned paper notebooks or lists, notes, etc. (It's a paper take on MS One Note, if you will. The paper is a nice weight...not too thick and not too thin. It has good heavyweight paper that doesn't bleed through if you are using a ballpoint pen (gel pens are a little more problematic). The paper is high quality, no bleed through, and the binding is solid. The paper is somewhat heavy, but wet inks (such as fountain pen) have slight bleed though to the back of the page; gel ink and ball point is okay.Deducting one star for the bleed through.Highly recommended The paper is about half an inch bigger than a standard sheet of lined paper, so more room to make notes.CONS:1.) Paper is just normal paper, and not very heavy. The 20lb paper is nice since it's slightly heavier and the ink does not bleed through to the other side.

Its not that real heavy paper, but its stronger than almost all loseleaf paper, and stronger than almost all spiral notebook paper.

The paper weight on this thing is roundabouts of standard printer paper, with a touch more weight to it.

I don't press down very hard, but this paper is hyper absorbent, so it seems to suck the ink straight out of my pen.If you want a heavier duty paper in an notebook that looks nice for business, go for theRhodia Notepads Graph Black Wb 8.3 x 11.7.
