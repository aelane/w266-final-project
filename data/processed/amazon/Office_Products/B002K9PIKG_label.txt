If they are not easy to remove, the label can be easily torn. (oh, they do have the label at the top/bottom to provide weight.) Small label size is great for a return address.4. Microsoft Word 2000-2007 have the Avery 5167 label template built-in, so you can use that without any additional software.2. I've preferred the 3M label products to both store brand & Avery. I tried to remove the label after 10 minutes but was unsuccessful without the label tearing. 3M has become my favorite label brand. A label is, well, pretty much a label. The label columns were separated vertically by open spaces of the waxed-paper like backing, which seemed to me would drastically increase the chances of jamming the printer. The label size is not among the predefined sizes used in MS Office Word 2007, so I went to 3M's website in search of a template. Also, the label height is such that you can only get 2 lines of default (11 pt) size type on them. I think it's because we tend to respect a properly printed label more. It shouldn't be complicated!They are crazy easy to peel & it's very simple to see where the label ends. They stick about as good as any other non clear label I have tried. Plus it looks more professional when you use a label. Compatible with Avery 5167 label template.I used WordPerfect Office X4 to create my labels. It says to use Avery label code 5167.

The label stays on the envelope - peeling it off is possible but not easy.

We're still using Word 97 and the label number 5167 was in our version, so I suspect it will be in yours.

I expect them to be just as useful as the other 3M permanent adhesive label products.
