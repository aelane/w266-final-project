The stapler is so powerful i do not want to imagine what will happen if a child presses it on a finger.However, it does what it is advertised to do very well and it really does deserve 5 stars. This stapler is super easy to load and super-easy to use.My husband was skeptical that it could possibly staple 65 pages at a time, but it does so with ease. The paperpro stapler is an awesome stapler. This stapler would be great for a medium sized office or someone who has kids who always have homework to staple together. This stapler takes 2 different sized staples: High capacity 65 sheet staples (use these to staple 10 to 65 sheets) and standard staples (use these to staple up to 30 sheets together). The stapler again stapled through it with ease, but one of the ends of the staple did not reach the other side. So it seems this stapler can handle just about any job with the limiting factor being the length of the prongs of the staples.As with standard staples, you can swing the base out of the way to staple stuff up on a board.This great quality, heavy duty stapler comes with a 2 year warranty. I will throw it away when I get a new stapler. The Paperpro blows away any traditional stapler, with effortless ease in stapling papers. Try doing that with a regular stapler - you'll likely hurt your hand and wrist. This stapler makes it very easy to do so. If you need a big-stack stapler, though, this is worth the price in the time and effort it will save you.Its mechanism is pretty powerful, so it takes a couple of tries before you get the hang of it (and you get used to the sound volume). Until I bought this stapler, I had to use binder clips for anything thicker. This stapler solved that annoyance for me: no more binder clips.If you're not familiar with the PaperPro staplers, these staplers have a spring mechanism that hammers the staple for you. I never thought I could love a stapler before but I do love this one. This stapler is easy to load. I will be using this stapler for all tasks since it is so effortless to use. This is the best stapler I've ever used.Addendum: When I posted my original review I had only used it with a large amount of pages to staple. Other than testing this stapler, I've never had a need to staple 65 sheets together. I don't think I've ever used a stapler like this.It loads much like a normal stapler, with normal sized staples. If you use a conventional stapler, you'll occasionally fail to drive the staple through correctly , because you didn't jam them straight through powerfully, and you'll occasionally have packets that are thick and difficult to staple. This stapler manages that automatically, and I think it's a lot more clever than an electric stapler.For the current price, I think it's a good value. This stapler comes with two boxes of staples with 500 staples each. This stapler shapes the staple to fold smoothly without poking through like a cactus needle for a wide variety of paper stack sizes. This is a great stapler. #1, if you're looking for a "regular" stapler, there are others which I think are easier to use. This stapler doesn't take up much room. This stapler is great and so easy to use though I will admit I haven't stapled 65 sheets together (mostly 40 or so). I have to admit I was skeptical about this stapler. This stapler works very well, but not with ease as described. If you're shopping for a heavy-duty-ish stapler, shop for price. I use this stapler once or twice per week to bind larger presentations and printouts of spreadsheets. When I got this stapler, the first thing I did was 50 sheets together and it worked perfectly. Otherwise, I would highly recommend this stapler to anyone. Opening the stapler is simple, removing the staple "pusher" is simple, dropping in a bar of staples is simple, closing the stapler is simple, but most important of all, depressing the handle is very simple and doesn't require as much strength as most other desktop staplers. Nevertheless, I'd recommend this stapler for users who need to staple together larger numbers of papers in an environment where the jolting sound will not interfere with other operations. The stapler again worked impeccably.Impressions:From the minute that I unpacked the PaperPro 1210, I felt that I had a quality product in my hands. You cannot fire the stapler "into the air" as they stated. If the stapler s not in contact with a solid surface, the handle remains locked. This stapler works very well for 20lb paper - about 65 sheets or so. It is really quite amazing and makes you wonder why it took the stapler manufacturers so long to come up with a stapler like this.The stapler comes with two boxes of staples, 500 in each box. I've been using the same old stapler for years, and never really knew that there was a better way. After all its just a stapler right? This stapler works so easy I can't believe just how easily it stapled a thick of a stack of papers with nearly no effort. The PaperPro Professional 65 is a very powerful, spring-powered stapler that easily stapled through 60 sheets in my usage. I actually did have that happen even with this stapler, but only at the limits of its range of 65 sheets.You are also able to swing the stapler open to use it as a tacker.There is even a safety feature on this stapler that prevents you from firing a staple into the air. Unless the stapler is in contact with a solid surface, the safety mechanism will lock the handle and prevent the stapler from firing a staple. Putting that aside however, the stapler works pretty much as advertised. I've never seen any stapler that comes with any kind of warranty, not to my recollection. This stapler does seem very sturdy.Another good thing about this stapler is what they call "A Cease Fire" Safety Feature, which prevents the stapler from being fired into the air. I says when the stapler is not in normal use or not in contact with a solid surface, the handle locks so the stapler will not fire a staple. This stapler is easy to use - my 6 and 8 year old daughters were able to make it staple exactly 65 pieces of paper on their own. So I loaded up the stapler with my trusty Stanley Bostitch high capacity staples and sure enough -- no problem. The stapler is made in Taiwan. The stapler is easy to use with two (or even one) finger.---The PaperPro high capacity stapler seems to be on par in performance and quality with the reputable and battle-tested Swingline brand of staplers (which is still my personal favorite). If you do decide on this stapler, remember to toss out the staples that come with the package and get yourself some quality high capacity staples. First, this stapler does what it should. The stapler is a bit loud (my dog is startled everytime I use it, but to be fair, my dog is also startled when I fold laundry), but it's not too loud for general office use. The stapler has a nice sturdy feel to it, and is easy to load with staples, and to use for tacking items to a bulletin board. The stapler comes with 2 kinds of staples..."low capacity" for 5-30 sheets of paper, and "high capacity" for 10-65 pages. I do not blame this on the stapler...I blame me. This stapler has an ingenious design, and it is able to really "Fire" a staple through a stack of paper with very little force required from the operator. To be honest I have used this stapler to staple more than 80 pages together with ease. The stapler comes with a small sample of regular staples and high capacity staples. So you may want to use a traditional stapler for your smaller jobs of just a couple pages.If you have any question feel free to leave a comment and I will try to respond. The Paper Pro stapler is the ultimate stapler for home or office use. The stapler comes with 30 sheet and 65 sheet capacity staples. This is an awesome stapler for big or small jobs! I would reccommend this stapler for all stapling needs. This incredibly well built and easy to use stapler exceeded my expectations.The thing is built like a Mack truck, with a sturdy and thick metal center body... but it's not heavy at all! )Overall, I am VERY impresses with this stapler. This stapler is attractive and nicely designed, and most important it does what it says--makes stapling lots of pages easy. All I can say is, this stapler lives up to its claims! You will need another regular stapler because you are not going to want to remove the staples from this one and reload depending on how many sheets of paper you are stapling. The stapler body is made out of metal and it feels like it'll last for years.It may not drive the heavy-duty staples or handle as many pages as myStanley Bostitch Extra Heavy Duty Stapler, but I rarely need to staple more than the 65 sheet capacity of this one.Y
