So this pop-up dispenser was the perfect solution. This is a very nice dispenser for use with Post-it notes. It is quite heavy and sturdy, so you don't have to ever worry about the dispenser itself being lifted when you grab a note. Otherwise they will not work in the dispenser. So, though it's not a perfect Post-It dispenser, it is still a good one. This dispenser sits on your desktop so they are handy and you can find one when you need one in a hurry.but....>  they only work with the interleaved post-its which are not always readily available at local stores (my target didn't have any).>  they only use 3x3 inch post-its - no lines, super sticky options offered in the interleaved style. You'll need to do this soon, because my dispenser only comes with about 8 post-it notes... not a whole new pad :(Bottom line, yes this is useful. Now with this dispenser you have some style choices and easy desktop placement. This dispenser is for someone who uses post-it notes and is looking for that extra weight to rip one off one handed. I was like finally, they made a heavier dispenser!I received my Post-it Pop-up Note Dispenser in the mail three days ago and so far, I must say, I'm in love! I have a post-it dispenser in my: kitchen (for the fridge, since magnets don't work on most modern appliances); home office; work office; bathroom (perfect for notes on the mirror! The dispenser itself is small and easy to fit on desks, bedside tables, kitchen islands, and the counters of kitchen and bathroom sinks. This dispenser is very handy and convenient. This means that the dispenser doesn't move when you extract a Post-it. The dispenser has 4 clear, rubbery type feet to prevent it from scooting around on your desk; it measures 4 x 4 x 1.5 inches, and holds 45 Post-it Pop-up Notes which are put together in an accordion style. This particular dispenser comes with a  reversible, removable insert; one side is a red & white animal stripe print, the other is a lighter blue design (both designs are shown in the product's photo. With this dispenser I can always find a sticky note. This Post-It dispenser is an attractive addition to any office. The dispenser is a nice heavy acrylic material, clear and you can make your own paper background, very easy, just cut out the same square shape with a rectangle hole for the Post-Its to come through.Very easy to pop up the "lid" and restock the Post-Its if you run out, and snaps back on. This is a dispenser for post it notes which dispenses them one at a time. This post-it dispenser is a sturdy, expensive-looking product that you can use to decorate your office more than for anything else. This is not a petite dispenser, so if you purchase it be sure you have enough room to place it. If you put the dispenser in a drawer, it doesn't clutter the desk top but takes up needed drawer space. I love this dispenser! This dispenser provides easy, one-handed access to one Post-It Note at a time (how often have a mistakenly pulled off two notes from a traditional pad, only to have to "re-stick" one back on the pad to keep from wasting it?). Also, be aware that this dispenser does not work with the traditional 3" x 3" Post-It note pads where the sticky area is always on the same edge of the notes. And the dispenser itself is a surprisingly heavy lucite gadget that works very well as a paperweight on my desk so that I always have a post-it close at hand when I want it.This is a well-designed product too.
