They have a brush tip. The "brush tip" is not a hair-based tip like you might think. With this tip you can be more creative with these markers compared to the traditional Sharpie markers. I expected the tip to be a bit more firm, allowing for the angle of your hand to determine the line thickness. These brush tip permanent markers are unusual in that you can control the width of the lines or letters by simply the pressure you apply to the marker.I experimented a bit and found that the most narrow line I could draw was 1/16th inch, and the widest was nearly 1/4 inch. The tip does bend and change from thin line to thick line when pressure is applied, but it takes some practice to determine what works for you. I am not sure how the tip will stand up to longer term use but so far I am pleased with these markers. This "brush tip" set allows for wide full area color coverage as well as getting into the tiniest corners and spaces. One tip does it all. Be aware of this - so you don't smoosh your tip. These brush tip sharpie markers were exactly what I needed to decorate my daughter's shirt. These are pretty much your standard broad tip sharpie but with a longer pointed tip. The soft tip lets out ink without nearly as much pressure,so with light strokes, you can label a paper or plastic bag, get a good heavy line,and not have to worry about puncturing the bag.They are not a substitute for a regular Sharpie, so I wouldn't plan on using this "instead of. The tip breaks down rather fast under normal to heavy use, even if the user doesn't press down hard on it. The tip is fairly firm. The tip makes strokes about the same size as a medium Sharpie marker. The tip can make medium to thick lines in a set of vibrant colors. They do not really have a brush tip in the sense of flexible little hairs, however the tip can be used to create different brush strokes for more artistic work and applications, such as decoration of binders for back-to-school. The tip is soft, so even though it appears as sharp as a pencil point, it's not going to be easy to use for pencil thin lines. These brush tip markers are just as effective as any of their previous form factors, and now have a tip that makes them perfect for pretty much any art use. Basically, these are a ultra fine tip Sharpie with a larger, more malleable felt head.

So I expected to love these brush tip markers, too.

Let me say first off that if you are expecting a Pentel, PITT, or Sakura level brush tip (or even a brush tip with actual bristles), you will make all sorts of sad faces.

I love Sharpies.The tip on this "brush" pen is longer and bulbous shaped, so you can achieve a greater variety of lines and shapes.
