First, I must admit that I am unwilling to thoroughly test this safe. Keep the safe closed and locked to get the benefits of the fire and water protection and keep your two keys separated and not inside the safe. This safe has a nice handle on it for any burglar to carry it off. Fire will seal this safe and it will need to be pried open but the safe has an &#8216;after fire guarantee&#8217; and will be replaced by Sentry if it is in a fire.The safe is not for guns, medication or combustible materials. Very easy to store!I think a safe is something a person needs to think about getting BEFORE they will or might need it. This safe will be filled quickly. The SentrySafe is a very good small safe for protection against moderate fire, and water. The safe would likely hold about the same as a small bank lock box. The safe is meant to sit flat rather than on end for maximum protection. It seems like a very good safe for papers and other valuables that might be put in a bank lock box.The instructions caution against storing pearls.

This safe would also be good for storing digital photos and backups of documents from your computer would do well here.

The safe is fairly heavy (20.4 pounds) and they put what looks and feels like a very lightweight, cheezy handle on it, that is not comfortable to hold.

I'm sure that this safe isn't meant to be carried around like a briefcase, but I'd still prefer a more rugged and comfortable handle.All that having been said, I think it's a good safe for the price if you have a small amount of papers and whatnot that you want to make sure is safe from fire and/or flood.
