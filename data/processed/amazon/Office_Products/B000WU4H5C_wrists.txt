It works great for my wrists, not much else to say there. My wrists and lower arms do benefit from using this, even over the wrist rest I replaced, and certainly over no rest at all. It helps resting your wrists and it is also easy to slide your wrist along - not inhibitive. It is very squishy and works well when you rest your wrists on it. I find that my wrists rest more naturally while typing than they did on my previous wrist rest (which went promptly into the trash immediately after unpacking this one). Your wrists might be germ free, but your keyboard is still germ central. But overall, it doesn't really help my wrists so I would not recommend it for anyone who already has problems. It's large enough to support larger wrists, but not too big for taking it with you on the road. The 3M Gel Wrist Rest is ergonomically designed and is extremely comfortable to rest your wrists on while using your existing keyboard. In the past, I have bought wrists rests that were either too cheap, too short, or poorly made (Yes, imagine gel leaking all over your desk and you having to clean it up and fight with cleaning the stains left behind). It supported my wrists and was very comfortable yet still firm.My problem with this product is that it is way too wide.

The Comfort Gel lets my wrists sink slightly in the wrist wrest but it is firm enough to not interfere with my typing.The black leather like cover looks good and compliments my keyboard.This is a simple, useful item that I never used before but will always use from now on.

I have large heavy wrists and I suffer from Carpel Tunnel so a solid wrist pad is important to me.

I normally rest my wrists on my desk when I type, which quickly leaves my hands feeling tired.
