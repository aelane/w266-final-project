The seat plate and backrest support are metal. The seat height is adjustable from about 17" to 21" above the floor. The seat swivels on the base, and the chair can be set to recline or not. I also like that the seat is not as wide from front to back as some other chairs on the market-I am rather short, and many chair seats are too broad, not allowing me to avail myself of the backrest (unless I want my knees to be on the seat cushion). The adjustable seat height and  movable arm rests allow me to move this chair from the computer desk to the (lower) sewing table with few problems. The seat base in comfortable, but firm as well. Under the seat cushion, there seems to be a piece molded into the basic shape of a rear end. The cushioned seat is comfortable and mesh back povides comfortable support. First, I thought the seat pan was unusually short. The seat and back are very comfortable. The seat and back are slightly stiff, but comfortable. The seat is fabric, arm-rests are plastic and the back is a cool mesh.
