...and organized with this one-stop binder. Besides of a good binder for students, this is also useful for small business owners, or anybody who needs to keep a large amount of documents organized and handy. What I like the most of this binder is the six pockets expanding file, with tabs that can be customized to our needs.I also like the design of it, it looks nice and its practical at the same time. It's not the best binder we've had but it's still pretty good. Great binder in a unisex color. Great binder! As of yet I see none with this binder. For now this binder is great. This binder is great because it has the normal 3 ring system but also has a zipper to keep any lose paperwork stored inside safely. Overall, this is a really nice binder that will last the entire school year and maybe longer. It's a bit more expensive than a traditional binder, but the added convenience of not losing paperwork more than makes up for it in my opinion, especially if you have a child that is prone to keeping a sloppy binder with loose paperwork hanging out. I have not used this binder for long, but I am more than pleased with its performance. The binder holds a full size notebook which I can use while in the binder.The handle is tight to the hand, just enough room to pick up without much gap. This binder is lightweight and perfect for my minimalist needs as a business person.I recommend it for business, school, or for someone who needs more than a binder to store and transport things. I originally ordered this binder for my sixth grader. !Next is a very generous 2&#34; wide three hole binder section with another zippered pouch - for pencils, rulers, markers and a cell phone pouch atop of that. It was a great binder while it lasted but it is already starting to fall apart after just a month of fairly heavy use. I wish the binder would have focused on either being a travel-ready filing system or a binder with an extra pocket. This is why I was interested in checking out this binder with files.In some ways it makes the mark:-Papers will not fall out and be lost or destroyed if they are placed in the internal folders and the binder is zipped.-This will hold a huge amount of loose leaf binder paper or work stuffed into the files as it is pretty big.-For the super-organized student, it keeps everything separated by tabbed folders, as well as having an internal pocket for smaller items so they can be accessed once opened to retrieve work.Unfortunately, a couple of these &#34;pros&#34; are also &#34;cons&#34;:-Unless a student is somewhat prepared to organize their work, they will likely just stuff the papers into the binder without bothering with the file folders, which may or may not result in any improvement over stuffing a backpack.-Because it is so large, it will barely fit into many backpacks along with much else. It will be interesting to see how this binder holds up, as my son can be rather tough on his school supplies. It will also be interesting to see if he actually uses and will need such a large binder!I love that it has a zipper and love the file organization. This binder is sturdy-looking but I assume as with everything else, it needs to be used with care as I don't think it will hold up to rough use. All in all, I would say this is a pretty cool binder, I only wish they had had these when I was at school! It has a large three-ring binder for loose-leaf paper. This binder holds a lot of stuff...papers, filed or hole punched, pencils, etc. The binder has a nice handle so that it can be carried like a  briefcase. The binder is perfect for that. This binder is a massively impressive binder, not one of the cheaply made ones that falls apart when it gets more than 50 pieces of paper in it. This binder is extremely roomy. Although I haven't had this binder for long (only a few months), it seems to be extremely durable. Overall, this is a great binder that I believe will last me for a while This binder works for students or in a casual business environment. This is a binder. When it comes to selecting a binder, there are only a couple of things to consider. This is a great binder. This is a great binder which includes two main sections: an accordion file section and a three-ring binder section. I used to use the binder coupon method myself, and I would have purchased this item for that purpose had I seen it back then!So far it appears durable. This is a hard-core binder. This is a nice 2 inch ring binder that includes a nice file section that can be accessed with a either from a dedicated zippered opening, or from the main compartment. The binder itself is way too wide to fit easily in a school backpack. This is a standard two-inch binder with a zipper closure. This is a very roomy binder, with pockets that can separate and hold a lot of different papers for different classes or projects. This is the perfect binder for someone who has to carry a lot with him or her. The binder has 2" rings, which means it can comfortably organize documents with page protectors, three ring pouches, workbooks, or anything else you need to keep handy. The 2" ring binder portion easily stores several printed software manuals which are useful for immediate reference and post-it notes. His current Mead binder has lasted through the entire school year (we have 4 weeks left) and I am expecting this one to be just as durable.This 2" binder has a nice feature in its 6-pocket expanding file, which can be accessed from both inside and outside the binder. This is a more masculine binder, so I can't see any guys carrying their binder like purse.This sturdy case will last the school year. The binder, itself, is not heavy at all and that is a big bonus for me.You might want to consider a small Grid-It organizer to place inside of the mesh pocket to keep your stuff organized, but this will add a little weight to the Binder. ), this binder doesn't make sense for someone who has a place to put things.Plus, the velcro/nylon compartments are really clumsy.Again - great for a student but not realistic for a businessperson trying to make a professional impression. The binder has a separate outer pocket with five-wide mouth plastic pockets for storing paper. and the binder comes with a handle along the spine for carrying it and/or transport.Cons: The filer can hold 880 sheets according to its attached card on the front, and it is roomy.)
