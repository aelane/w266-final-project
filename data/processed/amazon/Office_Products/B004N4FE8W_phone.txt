I own thePanasonic Dect 6.0 Black Cordless Phone with Answering Machine and ChoiceMail (KX-TG7432B)and love my phone set. I also like that he can answer the phone from the base with the speakerphone button if he misplaces the phone. Great phone, value, features, you name it. Great phone and speaker function. Also, even if you tell the phone to be silent, it will still repeat any incoming messages being left on the machine. This phone allows redial of long distance incoming calls with no hassle at all. I hate holding a phone when I'm talking and these handsets have a speaker phone mode in them that sounds great. A phone left off the charger, as the one I leave by the couch often is, will allow for 5-7 days of use before I have to put it back on the charger. Using this phone involved very little learning curve because of my familiarity with Panasonic phones.This is a programmable phone that uses audible caller ID, has an intercom capability, number blocking, handset paging and so much more.Very flexible and more than just an average telephone. What more would you need in a phone? After installing this phone and making a test call I was pleasantly surprised at the attainable volume level and the excellent sound clarity which this phone provided. Fortunately, I was able to dig out an old phone to use while I waited for delivery of these. I used to have a 3 phone system. This phone system has a base unit plus four handsets that ought to cover most of even a large house (and you can always purchase some additional ones if you need them. You can put a phone book on each hand unit, so each person's unit can become unique to them. This phone exudes quality, all the parts are very well made and looks good. I was pleased to find that Panasonic had a phone with all the features I had on my old phone, and more (and for a much better price). Program one phone and the rest (including the base unit) automatically update. You can answer the phone there only by hitting the speaker phone button. Looking at what will become available for May/June 2013, I'd recommend the KX-TG6845B - it is essentially the same phone as I have already reviewed here. Many phone returns later, I stumbled upon this one. This phone had all the features I needed, & having multiple headsets is great to have in each room. I really like this phone & hope to have it for a long time. My Uniden phone had quite a few melodies that were great.5. My Uniden phone had a flashing indication as well as an audible beep. The Uniden phone had a dedicated Intercom button, then a simple scroll and click to choose the handset you want to connect to.8. If you've never had a Uniden or a phone with this much power and features, you'll probably love it completely. This phone system has been great so far.Pros:1 - I love that it speaks the name of the person that is calling when they call. This is a great phone system, expandable to boot. I purchased an extra phone so now I have 6 of them. I bought this phone based on the Amazon buyer reviews. To me it works exactly like a corded phone. The phone works during a power black out and should the black out go on forever, I can keep it going with the rechargeable AAA NI-MH batteries that I have in my TV remotes, flash lights, recharge the batteries else where, etc. Basically this phone is a pleasure to use...... Update 7/18/2012: Ordered a second set for my parents and the sound fades in and completely out on that set! Fantastic phone. My last phone has a voice mail button all the time for one touch voice mail access. At first, I liked that compared to my old phone that would just display the most recent time called and the total number of times called. With this phone it is usually gone after a couple of days. So I ended up keeping the phone--not the end of the world--but I would rather have spent the same money on phones that worked 100% of the time.

For me, buying a new phone system is about as enjoyable as buying a GPS for my car.

The phone uses caller ID info to speak who is calling after the 2nd ring.

My Uniden phone had a vastly superior sound quality in the earpiece.
