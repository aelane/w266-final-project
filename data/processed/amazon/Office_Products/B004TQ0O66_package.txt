I also would like to see a multi-colored package and more color choices. We received one package of orange hearts, stars and circles. On the package it says to remove them very slowly, which I did. The package comes with 18 shapes and is available in different colors. My package contained 18 pink reusable shapes (circle, heart, star) and my kids quickly found some items that we wanted to hang. The package says they'll hold up to 3/4 lb, but after a week only 1 of our photographs is still sticking to the refrigerator. Our package contained blue stars, hearts, and circles. Each package comes with 18 shaped pieces. Each package somes with only 18 stickers (2 sheets of 9), making it important to reuse them as many times as possible. I would also like to see a package with an assortment of colors added to the lineup of orange, blue and pink shapes. I was recently sent a package of Scotch Restickable Shapes to try out. I received the Blue package.
