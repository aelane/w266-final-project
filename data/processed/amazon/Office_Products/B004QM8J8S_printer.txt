The printer doesn't have to be turned on and off all the time, as when it is not in use it goes into power saving mode - hence it takes a few seconds to warm up.All in all a great unit and for my needs I couldn't ask for anything better. That alone means the printer has paid for itself. I got a Laser printer because Ive always used them at the office and they seemed much better. This printer replaces a black and white samsung ML series laser I mainly use for printing code samples and calendar tasks.Firstly, at the price I got it on Amazon this printer is a steal. This I use the printer and scanner frequently and am very satisfied. So I bought this printer and a Canon Pixma iX6520 inkjet, which I can use for wide-format printing (I need it for business).As it turns out, this is a GREAT GREAT laser printer. The printer doesn't look cheap. This printer really suits me nicely. I was hemming and hawing about buying this printer when it was at $200 but when the price dropped super low, I couldn't pass it up. Have been using printer, scanner and copier almost daily for several weeks; works without a hitch. Use it wirelessly exclusively.I needed a second printer, so I bought the Brother HL-2280DW.Scanner: Good for the price, a little quirky at times, but more than useable.Printer: So far I&#8217;ve only been able to print using a USB printing cable. This printer will also print on 110 pound (cover stock)--which is out of spec, I lick my finger and run it along the center top (outside) edge of the card stock in the drawer. This printer spills anything over about 15-20 pages onto the floor.Wireless this printer is a total bust. I've owned this printer for 1.5 years of light use -- occasionally printing lists, letters, boarding passes, and the like.
