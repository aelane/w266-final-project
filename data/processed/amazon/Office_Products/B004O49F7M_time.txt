Every time I used super glue in those round tubes, I'd wind up tossing most of it out or trying to cut the dispenser top to get it unclogged. I was really surprised to see that it worked perfectly the next time I went to use it. Perfect dispensing every time. It is about time to be able to use super glue without gluing your fingers together. This couldn't have come at a better time. I don't believe I'll get it all back together this time, but as a test for the Scotch Super Glue Liquid in Precision Applicator, it is exemplary.I had no problem at all applying a bead of glue to the very thin edges of the shell fragments. For a long time I thought it was either something about the chemicals used to make superglue, that they were so sensitive to being exposed to air that just opening the package would make it dry out. Success, and I am sure that the next time I need a drop of super glue, it will be usable.

BUT, getting them to work the second or third time is the charm.

Only time will tell whether this larger tube will suffer the same fate as the little ones.

Open time?
