For extra heavy boxes, up to 70 lbs.Adhesion level  HighIndoor/Outdoor  Indoor/OutdoorUV/sunlight resistant  NoMaximum application temperature (F)  120Minimum application temperature (F)  35Moisture Resistant  NoProduct Width (in.) We build the boxes in the heat but then they are filled with frozen meat and stored in the freezer. It held my boxes together. I overpacked a few boxes and didn't even see it bow when the movers were tossing things around. I frequently send boxes, sometimes with one-of-a-kind items that can't be replaced.While in shipment, boxes sometimes weighing fifty or more pounds are tossed onto other, much more fragile packages. I have some large boxes that I had over stuffed and sometimes they do not stay closed. It is also good for holding several boxes together. I have also used it to strengthen boxes I use to store files and other items in my basement that have weakened over time.I noticed the thickness of the tape as soon as I opened the package.

I've used this on boxes that have that kind of waxy shiny finish to them and some tapes come loose on those but this holds tight.

I also used it to seal some heavy boxes for a friend who was moving and again, the tape held strong without double taping!

Taping boxes together that will stay together even with books inside.
