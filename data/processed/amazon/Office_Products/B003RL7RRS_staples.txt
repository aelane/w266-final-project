These staples came in a cure plastic container and work well. These staples fit my stapler, don't get clogged up in the stapler, and haven't rusted. Well, this is staples to staple paper. The staples you get do make a difference. They are the staples that the literature recommend you use for this stapler. I highly recommend these staples for the Optima 45 Swingline stapler I had to return these staples as they did not fit the mid-weight stapler that I had just purchased from them... great customer service 4 Premium Chisel Point Staples, 0.25 Inch Leg Length, 1 Box,... staples are staples but these come a t a great price. The staples the office buys are just absolute rubbish. I noticed that I use the SF4 staples at home and I didn't even realize it. With the SF4 staples, my Swingline 767 can staple 20 sheets of paper 100% of the time. It makes the staples easier to dispense versus fumbling with a cardboard box that may spill out some of the staple racks.Overall: 4/5 stars, improves reliability of stapling but can still bind at or over 25 pages using a Swingline 767 stapler. You can find less expensive staples. These Swingline staples work so well with the hand-held Swingline stapler. With so many staples on the market, it is nice to find the ones that were designed for the hand-held stapler. It is staples, and it is from the famous stapler's company - Swingline. 4 Premium is most standard staples for all purposes application usages. I recently ran out of Swingline staples and I had another brand in my desk drawer and I started using them. I am sure that I wasted more staples than I used. These staples come in a nice plastic box to hold them together and keep them in the 4 inch long strips that they come in. These staples work great and don't jam in my old stapler. I thought it was one of these staples that can only bind maximum of 4 papers together. I like Swingline staples because they work beautifully. They're staples. I had tried some other similarly sized staples of a different brand that seemed to fit into the stapler, but they jammed and had to be pulled out with a long nose pliers. I don't purchase staples very often because I don't staple a lot these days so 5000 staples should last me a very long time and the price seems reasonable. Recommend these staples for light staple users and small amount of papers not like a whole giant pack! These staples staple my papers together with the greatest of ease, I slap down on my stapler and they penetrate the paper and wa la they are held together. these staples work best for my needs.T
