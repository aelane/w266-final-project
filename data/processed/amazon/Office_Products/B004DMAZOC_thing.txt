This thing does not hold many staples at once, so it will be a matter of refilling it a lot. Moreover, the thing pops open at the least provocation. The more I look at this thing, the more I see how badly it is designed.----My current desk stapler is at least 35 years old. Not a thing wrong with this product! I love this little thing, so I was surprised to see that others didn't, and looked at some of the reviews. I went back and checked to sure, this thing punches through fourteen pages of that thick heavy stuff every single time but at fifteen pages it misses sometimes.This is a good quality and very easy to use stapler. So what's the next best thing? The great thing is if this stapler does go walking at work, it's inexpensive enough to replace. The nice thing about the SmartTouch is that is can stand to be pounded from the top (like regular staplers) or it can be gripped on the top and bottom for one-hand stapling.

I'm still not convinced about how this thing looks, but I'm more than convinced with how it's constructed and how it works.The stapler is made of metal, though it's not heavy and can easily be lifted with a single hand or used sitting on a desk.

The best thing about it is its ergonomic design combined with a teasing purple color.

The one thing that could make this product absolute best if the manufacturer included a set of staples in the device (at least a few).Anyone wishing to staple more than 20 papers is out of luck, so if you are planning to purchase this one, consider it for minor tasks, like stapling magazine pages (which are softer than the usual white paper).Overall, good product with appropriate price, but don't forget to purchase a box of staples.
