You simply set the timer accordingly and, when the presentation begins, you start the timer. The timer feature is very interesting, although the instructions weren't clear on how the units of time are displayed. If you pause the timer, the bar graph becomes an equal sign.Overall, the R800 is a feature-rich presentation remote that features a comfortable grippy texture with an ergonomic shape so your hand doesn't get numb during a long briefing. The timer is excellent and it vibrates to let me know when there's 5 minutes remaining, 2 minutes, 1 minute, etc... The built-in timer is fantastic. With its built in timer, the LCD display is clean and simple. It has a timer function with a vibration to help you pace your presentation, but setting the timer is fairly labor intensive and not worth it to me. The timer feature is awesome, but for the life of me I can't understand why they didn't include a back light for the screen -- it's going to be used in the dark! If you can live without the timer or the readout screen, then I would definitely consider it. The timer only vibrates when you have 5, 2, and 0 minutes left. You can only set a countdown timer. If you don't stop the timer at zero, it starts counting up.The display also reports battery level and wireless signal strength, flashing when it has lost the signal.Included in the package is a very nice padded case that is high quality and has the look of leather, though I assume it is really vinyl. I love the timer and the effortless feel of it in my hand. Not only that, it has a timer so you don't over extend yourself or your welcome. The timer option is perfect for those who need to keep track of the time limit they've set themselves or have had set for them. Do wish that the timer could light up.The vibrating function helps you to wrap things up in a dignified manner rather than trying to rush to fit in your lecture/presentation into the remaining time.Love it.Update:Been using this for about a year now and I have a few things to add.It does use up batteries fairly quickly if you are using the laser all the time, mine last about 10 hours total with regular batteries.
