This is combined with using the paper profiles supplied by Canon or the manufacturer of the printer paper you are using. There are actually two paper intake slots. The paper included is 8.5 x 11, which tells you everything you need to know about Canon's confidence about the Pixma Pro-100's ability to create beautiful, large prints. When you pull out the two paper trays it grows several more inches in width. I set the paper type to Plain and selected the fastest print to lay down the least amount of ink. This paper is rather expensive, so I want to reserve it for the very best photos. I have not printed on that paper yet. You should always use the right paper for best results for a final product, I don't always use good paper when trying out different tweaks, but when I am ready I do use the best paper for the job and yeah.. they are really nice!5) Ink Life , so far so good, I have not had to re-order any yet, but I can follow this up with edit later to let you know. I used Canon Glossy Photo paper for my test prints and the results were superb. I purchased additional paper in order to test print quality:Canon Photo Paper Pro Platinum, 8 x 10 Inches, 20 Sheets (2768B019)andCanon Photo Paper Plus Glossy II, 5 x 7 Inches, 20 Sheets (2311B024). I used same paper(Epson pro luster) with correct printer profile on photoshop cs6. It might be the Epson paper on a Canon printer, but, because I chose correct paper profile, it shouldn't matter. Only wish I have is supporting roll paper feed for panoramic image printing. So they actually stop you from printing on the whole paper! Canon will think you are using a flat coated matte paper. Then in Photoshop or whatever you use, select your paper profile there for the paper you'll really use, and you'll be able to print nearly full page with the standard " border.Please, avoid borderless printing on any printer whenever you can. This is a good paper (better than the Epson luster paper) that manages to show good detail. I was pleasantly surprised how nicely the Canon printed on this paper (using a Canon glossy profile). Expect more paper jams with this one.-Can print roll paper for panoramic-Since it is pigment, less variation in finishes as ink sits on top of the paper.-Must be turned on and nozzle check pattern printed 1x/wk to prevent clogging.
