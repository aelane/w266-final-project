I love this stapler so much, I put my name on it. This stapler works fine, doesn't jam. This is a great little stapler. This stapler gave me about 2 months of good use and then it started to malfunction badly. A stapler might seem like such an incredibly simple item to have in an office. I don't mean to rhapsodize TOO much over what a stapler can do, but this is just amazing! I promptly bought him a PaperPro stapler of his own, and now he loves it as well.With all the grief we deal with in the world, it's nice to have something that is dependable and reliable to turn to. it's almost like an electric stapler! This stapler is unlike any stapler I've used. The stapler can also sit on a desk the regular way, or you can invert it and have it standing up.The main advantages to this stapler are the ease of use and number of pages it can staple. I bought this stapler because I wanted a something that could staple more than a regular stapler without getting jammed of bending the staples incorrectly. The stapler can easily staple 30 sheets of paper and still keep them bound. With every other regular stapler I've used, the more sheets of paper you staple, the harder you have to press on the stapler. This is a wonderful stapler that easily staples big groups of papers without having to put all your weight on it. I use my stapler all day long and wore out sensor desk stapler in just a few years. This is a quiet and easy touch stapler.
