The book progresses gradually through more complex activities, such as completing the sentence "I am happy when. This book compliments that well, though because it allows young children to write words first (which is much easier to do as they are still practicing writing their letters), then parts of sentences, and then full sentences. This book uses nice vibrant and friendly graphics to encourage children to express their thoughts on paper. This book is perfect for that, because it adds a "creative thought" element to writing, and it's something she enjoys doing in her spare time.The book starts out with a couple of pages for kids to practice their alphabet (the "ascender" and "descender" parts of the row are a different color, so they stand out more), then dives into the creativity portion... the next several pages ask kids to think of 6 things you'd find in an farm/classroom/party/etc. ")So the book provides enough structure to make it easy for the child to understand what is being asked, and the repetition makes it easy for them to remember the structure. I do not really see where this book teaches creative writing. The book starts out quizzing kids on what they know about certain subject, such as: What would you see on a farm? Essentially the book uses very common words and pictures to spark the child's imagination to form words and sentences. This carries on through the next 1/4 of the book. I really like how this book focuses on simple descriptions and things that are easier to understand for younger kids. The book encourages them to dig deep but keeps it simple to understand and do, hopefully helping creative kids to learn the much needed basics! But this book takes engaging teaching methods to the next level. This book was very fun and educational for my daughter. Well, he was really excited to get the book and open it. She absolutely loved this book! The book includes bright pictures, practice in writing, and ideas for constructing sentences. This book was a big hit. We liked Mead's Number Stories book so much that I figured we'd give Ideal Builders a try. This book offers just two pages for handwriting practice with one space to trace and one space to write the letter on your own for each letter in it's upper and lower case forms. This is an excellent book for beginning writers that encourages creativity. This book (Idea Builders, Stage 3) is for kids who have the basics down and need practice to improve the physical part of writing skills. The book is extremely colorful and has a lot of content. that the book provides. The book itself is well done, and would be a solid asset for helping kids learn to write stories - if that style is a good fit for the particular child. This particular book includes writting adjectives, verbs, nows; words that fit different situations and sentences, as well as story cut outs and sequence words. That's what this book is. The book is suggested for K-2. This is an excellent book for your K (with help) through 3rd grader... it makes them think and put together a story in a linear fashion... so it really helps with their reading and writing skills, especially comprehension, putting down similar thoughts on paper and organizing them into a story that makes sense. I got this book to use with a student with special needs. Fantastic!I'm very pleased with it and intend to buy another book when my younger children are ready.Sra. This would not be a very helpful book for kids who can't read very well yet. I really like this book. The book is for grades K-2 and I think that's on target. This book is full of prompts and worksheets that will help you as you teach your kindergartener letters and writing.
