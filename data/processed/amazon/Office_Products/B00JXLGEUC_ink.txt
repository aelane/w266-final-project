When I look up the ink on Amazon it seems a little out there for ink pricing so i sure hope this thing sticks by its word and it will &#34;save me money in the long run on ink&#34;  I took 1 star off because of the back load slot for the envelopes. and also the ink pricing because I am pretty sure this printer you will need to purchase true epson ink which right now Amazon only carries the black it seems? The ink ordering names are nicely displayed though.-If you used an earlier WorkForce series printer, the fax operation feedback seems less refined. *The ink seems less expensive, but that is because the cartridges are half the size of most printer cartridges. I find the ink dries fast also, so I've not had any problems with ink smearing. I will definitely switch ink cartridges to the larger capacity once these play-out. That's fine with me, but after installing the ink and closing the access door, a message told me that it was initializing and it could take about six minutes. * The ink cartridges are small. We had to replace the ink 3-4 times a year even with frugal use. Time will tell if the ink costs are similar to that of my older Canon, but for ease of set up and actual functionality with regard to wireless capability this Epson WF-3640 is really good and solved an immediate problem. And the ink for these printers is expensive. It'll prime the ink for several minutes and then it'll tell you to load the paper. The ink lasts a long time (but I'm not printing volumes every day).
