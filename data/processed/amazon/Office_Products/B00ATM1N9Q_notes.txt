That is what helps you organize your notes. The notes are only saved in the app unless you specifically transfer them to the camera roll. Livescribe gives you audio with your notes which is absolutely fabulous for students. The notes are stored in the Shot Note app, but can be sent to your email or a linked Evernote account. Individual notes can be converted into high contrast black and white images that makes the notes clearly legible (my favorite feature).The app is free and the notepad isn't horribly expensive. Ideally, I could also search through my notes by character recognition keywords too.Overall, if you want an extremely simple to use, no frill note taking app that works with a pad of paper and no fuss, the Shot Note is absolutely worth a try, hence the 3-stars. Notepad & Sticky Note are fantastic for taking notes, if I want to doodle I have a drawing app and there are a gazillion more apps if I don't happen to have exactly the right one. Later, you can search your 'library' of notes easily, using the app.The fact the app straightens the image for you is a feature lacking in other IOS scan apps. This is good when I have To Do lists.Evernote is a very good notes app-the best out there. You put your notes on it and then line your camera in your phone or iPad up with it and take a picture. It's easier to just jot down notes throughout the day on a scratch pad and type them up when I get home. Being able to write your notes by pen and then have them digitized by taking a picture with your phone or iPad is a pretty neat idea.I hoped that this would work a little better. I'll stick to using VocaVoice for short notes, and entering my notes right into Evernote on my phone or laptop. You take your notes, then you take a picture of your notes and the app saves the picture. If you enjoy taking notes by hand but also want a digital copy of your work, this "smart" notepad is supposed to solve all your problems through an App that takes optimal pictures by aligning the image with the four little marks on the corners.
