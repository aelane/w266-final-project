Up until now if they wanted to hang something, they would have had to hang only stuff on their bulletin boards. you can remove them and use them again for something else (say when Hannah Montana is no longer "cool" and needs to be replaced with Gaga posters).As a mom and a teacher, I enjoy them as well. Very useful for when you want something secure but don't want to use nails or glue, plus they hold better than double-sided tape. That being said they are great for putting something up that you need affixed for a while but maybe not forever, for example: charts in a classroom or office, monthly schedules, etc. I mean, how can it be strong and still temporary without giving up something. Not something I would have thought to go out and buy, but we'll always keep some around going forward. But, in general, they do what they say they will, so, if you need something like this, go for it.Each square is supposed to hold no more than 1/4 lb, not to exceed a total of a pound. I guess this means don't try to hold up something that weighs more than a pound, even if you attach a ton of squares to it. And if you need to move something later (I had placed a couple posters at a crooked angle), they are easy to remove from the wall and then reuse.I just wish these had been around when I was in college and had an order of magnitude more posters. If you are hoping to hang up something heavy, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. This is bad because you might think you've stuck something on for good, but it will fall off later.
