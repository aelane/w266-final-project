It also raises the monitor up a little too high for me. It's a monitor stand. The monitor sits on it. I have had my heavy VGA monitor at work sitting on it all day and so far it hasn't collapsed. I have a second 24inch monitor next to my 27 inch iMac and I needed a way to lift it up to the same level as the iMac and still look nice on my desk and this does that perfectly.It comes with the little rubber grommets so you can raise it just to the right height.It looks nice ,matches the decor of the desk and also gives you a little area under the monitor to store stuff.The rubber grommets also keep it locked in place on the desk . once you set your monitor on top of there it's not moving!You'll not be disappointed with this. Even though I recently upgraded my monitor at work to theSamsung P2250 22-Inch Widescreen LCD Monitorfrom an older 15 inch, I still found myself looking down while working. I do have my monitor located in the corner of my desk, so this style works to my advantage. Because of this, my LCD monitor was too far away when on the riser, but I could not get it closer without setting it on the desk proper, making it too low. It elevated my monitor such that I am looking straight ahead. I have a large monitor. It raises the monitor and gets other items out of the way. The monitor riser does work there, but I fear that a good push to the rear will send the rear leg over the edge. I want to glance down at the monitor, but there is sits with my eyes squarely directed to the bottom of the screen. I have to remove my Dell monitor from the Fellowes Smart Suites Corner Monitor Riser and carry the riser downstairs to store for possible use at some future date. I have my monitor in a corner setup so this works well for me.It is cheap looking plastic so if style is important to you, you may want to look for something else. I thought about setting the monitor up on books, but hey...there goes any usable space beneath -- and, it looks..., well, you know.so, I was very happy to find the Fellowes Smart Suites Corner Monitor RiserAfter adjusting for height with one set of included, seemingly slip proof, rubber feet, or stackers (note: two sets are provided -- so one can even get that monitor higher, if needed), I placed my flat panel monitor on the Fellowes Smart Suites Corner Monitor Riser. This is a sturdy monitor riser for a CORNER. It supports up to a 22-pound monitor which is fairly hefty. If you have your monitor in a corner, it fits perfectly. My monitor is against a flat wall, so it doesn't do me much good. That works out really well if you are not placing your monitor in a corner. It can support a 21" monitor, has three height adjustments, and has storage space underneath it. It looks cleaner and the monitor height is perfect for my uses. I would be scared to break my monitor using them. I acquired this monitor stand to hold up a 13" CRT based TV in my mother's home. If the monitor you have is on a stand that is fixed height (we use a bunch of fairly inexpensive Acer monitors at my work, all of which are on such stands) this can be of great benefit.For me, this piece of equipment somewhat replaces an older monitor stand that I had been using. Since I had my monitor set back to the edge of the desk, I really didn't want to bring it forward much. Alone the monitor stand is relatively high, but each of the three feet includes two rubber riser feet. This monitor stand being all plastic would not dissipate heat as well.
