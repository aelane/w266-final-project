This is a good, heavy-duty stapler. My Bostitch EZ Squeeze stapler arrived in a heavy duty box. This stapler will ONLY work with Bostitch EZ Squeeze 75 staples, which are almost impossible to find on Amazon. Pressing the stapler was a little harder, but the results were just as good. Otherwise I'm very happy with the stapler and I'm busy looking for more piles of paper to organize and staple! This really is great stapler. This is a great stapler for us- my husband is a software engineer who often prints out hundreds of pages of manuals and project details, I'm an artist who does a lot of bulky mixed-media pieces, and my daughter is a five year old who loves to craft and put together her own "books" of her drawings and magazine pages. So for us, this stapler is a great thing to have- it easily staples through MANY pages without any wrist or hand strain or "errant" staples that don't quite do the job.However, it does require special staplesStanley Bostitch B8 Xtra High Carbon PowerCrown Staples (STCR75XHC)and it doesn't come with any, so order those too and keep a supply on hand. I just want my stapler to work. I really can't recommend this stapler. I can always use another stapler in my office. Since this is the only stapler in my office that would require these specific staples I won't be purchasing them. This stapler's form factor makes it a lot easier to use than a standard stapler. Plus, while a typical stapler does not come with staples, it would have been nice if this came with a starter pack, which it does not. This is a powerful stapler that will easily take of stapling needs. This stapler is GREAT it is easy to load and very easy to use. This is a very very good stapler!!! I have to give it to them: Stanley Bostitch makes a fine stapler. No slamming the stapler down on the stack of papers you want to staple together. This is a great stapler for those heavy duty jobs, even though it is really big and clunky and a bit funny looking. This stapler looks like a good tool. As a stapler, the STANLEY BOSTITCH EZ SQUEEZE 75 FLAT CLINCH REDUCED EFFORT STAPLER B875 is a FIVE-STAR unit. The stapler was cleverly designed with a fractionally narrower magazine so standard staples are too big to fit! The stapler I had been using is older than I am, but happily accepts standard staples, meaning it'll still be stapling long after I'm gone.In short, while this stapler does all it says it will and does it well, I have large reservations about the special staples required to operate it. While the stapler itself is reasonably priced, is the high price of the special staples it needs to operate cost efficient? The Bostitch B875 is a super stapler. The stapler itself does not come with any staples at all and standard staples -Swingline S.F. 3 Premium Chisel Point Staples, 0.25 Inch Leg Length, 105 Count Half Strips, Silver, 5000 Staples per Box (S7035440)- do not fit in this stapler. The stapler comes with no instructions or staples and you have to figure out to press the button and then pull staple housing forward to load the staples.There is a reason it probably does not come with any staples: when you order the staples, you are going to feel ripped off! Then it would staple normally.I really liked the stapler, even though I have to slam it to staple bigger piles of papers. I found this stapler to be a breeze for this purpose. This stapler is great for those heavy duty jobs, and we have quite a few of them.
