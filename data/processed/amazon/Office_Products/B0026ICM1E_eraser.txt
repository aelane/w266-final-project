It comes with a eraser, which cleaned the pencil markings very well. The eraser is very narrow, but the package also includes two extras of those.Between all the refills and the fact that you won;t be breaking the leads often, this little package should last quite a while. I don't use the eraser that much because I like having one of those erasers that look like a pen. The eraser did not smear the lead when I used it and perhaps that is why it comes with a hard lead but perhaps it is a good eraser!To me it is a fantastic tool. They're cheap and easy to use; and the eraser is my friend. I usually will rub down the whole eraser before the pencil is sharpened too small.There are a couple things I don't like about wooden pencils:  1) You have a resharpen them to keep a thin writing line. 2) The eraser usually gives out before the lead does. The eraser could use more work for my use, but since I'm trying to erase some seriously heavy marks with it, I can't say that anyone using it normally would have an issue with it. And while it's nice that it will keep the eraser from getting lost, chances are the cap itself will get lost pretty fast. The eraser, which is covered by a removable plastic piece, erases well and effortlessly. The eraser is extremely small and the cap is a bit hard to remove. You'll want to keep a more substantial eraser around for long writing or drawing sessions.The Twist and Turn feature seems to actually work. Go figure.Get an old yellow #2 with the eraser on top, put the other end into a pencil-sharpener and then write. The eraser is also fairly wimpy. The eraser erases, nuf' said. You will have to carry a separate eraser or have it on your desk as the process of taking off the plastic cap and putting it back on is a nuisance.Overall advancement in mechanical pencils that is welcome as it will replace other disposable pencils with a more precise writing instrument. I do wish that it had a bigger eraser. I use a separate eraser for the constant erasing and shifting of names. And you need to remove the eraser to get the other lead. I'm just as heavy-handed when I erase too...I found it too easy to depress the eraser into the pencil (as if advancing the lead). I'm spoiled by the Pentel's huge eraser. If you like using a separate eraser, this won't be an issue, but for me it's a loss of a star. And finally, the eraser works well and is long enough that it doesn't pop out when you use it. Also, you don't have to click the eraser with this one, you just easily twist for the lead to come out. The eraser is super small and I'm afraid that there will be nothing to fix a mistake. I always burn through the eraser on these thing super-fast!)
