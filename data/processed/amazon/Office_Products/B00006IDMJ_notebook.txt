You honestly can't go wrong with a Five Star notebook. This notebook cames with me everywhere so I know where the information is. This is a nice looking notebook. Sure, any old spiral notebook will work fine. This notebook contains 100 sheets of college ruled paper. This is a 1 subject notebook with 100 sheets of paper and spiral bound. This is a fine, perfectly utile 100-page notebook, with non-archival quality paper, the kind of thing you rely on for quick use and immediate functionality. Really like this spiral notebook. I can't imagine this notebook coming apart unless someone deliberately tries, and then they would have to be strong to break it down.All in all, a notebook that looks like it could last for quite some time. This notebook is built strong, so that it lasts much longer than ordinary thin notebooks. This spiral notebook has plain lined paper. This spiral notebook is perfect for me because I manhandle them, meaning the following. I will grab my notebook when I'm rushing out the door. This notebook solves these problems:1) The covers are semi-laminated, protects them from water and coffee.2) The 'pockets' are reinforced so I don't rip them when I put too many loose papers in them.3) The pages stay secure thanks to the tight spiral, and open easily without getting caught.4) Both ends of the metal spiral are turned back and attached to the metal: no little paper-clip thin ends to catch onto material.5) "college-ruled"6) Paper isn't cheap and translucent, so the writing on the other side doesn't show through.Now if these notebooks could only automatically improve my handwriting, I'd be really happy with them. This spiral notebook is made better than most. This notebook has 100 pages - enough for about a month of calculus notes. This notebook is very durable and stands up to a decent amount of travel in my bag. This notebook has a nice thick cardboard back so that you can write with it on your lap and not needing anything else for support underneath. Sturdy and well made notebook is holding up nicely so far. I highly recommend this notebook. I received this spiral notebook as part of the Vine program. This notebook has 100 college ruled pages. I never had a notebook with a pocket before...don't think I can go back now, I am spoiled! This seems like a pretty sturdy notebook though it'll take a few months of use to know if it holds up. This is a nice spiral notebook. My notebook arrived in perfect condition. The notebook is &#34;guaranteed,&#34; so if it were truly horrible, you could go to the web site for a replacement or refund (though most companies will do that if you write to them).
