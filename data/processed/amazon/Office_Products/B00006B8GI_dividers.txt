These dividers are good for general use.PROS:--Durable--Professional looking--Convenient labelsCONS:--Not much different from other dividers--A bit expensiveRecommended for professional use. The dividers are white and strong.Now the EZD Ring binder is very impressive... These dividers were just what the teacher ordered for organizing my high school student's binder. The dividers fit a standard 3 ring binder. The dividers themselves seem very sturdy, and they should survive pretty rough handling in a notebook.A new way of doing divider tab labels isn't going to change the world, but this Avery product makes life just a little easier. They came through again with these dividers. The dividers are thicker than your standard paper, but no where near the quality of say cardstock. To help keep the dividers from shifting when applying the labels, I placed them in a three-ring binder.Even though I only have a simple inkjet printer, the labels ended up looking professionally printed and don't smear, which seems surprising on something transparent.There's a drawback, though, in that the label sheets are only supposed to, based on the manufacturer's directions, be fed through the printer once. I hate it when you have to tape the actual dividers because they are falling apart.....not with these....very nicely put together.

If you need dividers for presentations or just to look good it's almost impossible to get most labels to print out with the right alignment.

The dividers themselves are tough, reinforced, bright white, and very crisp.

I put the dividers in a binder first so they were all perfectly set up.I used the set that was sent to me to organize gym junk.
