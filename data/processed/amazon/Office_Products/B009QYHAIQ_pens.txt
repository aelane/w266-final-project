So far I love these pens! I am left-handed and many pens smear as I write. I usually use either uni-ball 207 pens or TEKwriterUSA Gelwriter gel pens, both of which I love. These Pilot pens have a nice grip and write very smoothly without ink spots or smearing.However, the current price (currently just over $10 for 5 pens) is a little high when compared to the uni-ball 207 pens (currently just under $10 for 8 pens). I think the Pilot pens write smoother than the uni-ball, but the grip is about the same and the Pilot pens feel a little cheap overall (and sort of looks it). They are great pens and I recommend them, I just think they are a bit overpriced. I love most Pilot pens. These pens are great because they offer vibrant colors...great to spice up note taking, journal writing, or even your shopping list. These pens have a rubber comfort grip which makes the feel of it so comfortable. What I particularly love about these pens is that the ink lasts longer than most gel pens that I've used AND the barrel helps me write longer without pain. I particularly enjoy writing with gel-style pens, as I often find them to have a smooth line, so I was interested in trying these Acroball Colors from Pilot. I love my pens, particularly in bright colors, particularly purple, so I thought this would be a pleasant treat. These pens -- not so much. These pens are advertised as a &#34;gel ball point.&#34;  They definitely write more like an old-fashioned ball point pen than a more contemporary gel pen. I love these pens! )These are not kiddie pens, although kids might well enjoy drawing with them. These pens are so awesome. I would recommend these pens for keeping notes when you need an eye catching color to keep you on topic and focused. My very favorite pens are Zebra's Sarasa Gel Retractable Pens, 0.7mm, Assorted, 10 Pack (46881), so I was interested to see if these "hybrid gels" were any better or different. I found these pens to be superior in many ways. The pens are of normal comfort and are good for long note taking sessions.I envision the best use of this product for a student who takes a lot of notes during class and would use color to organize a lecture or outline.The pens look a bit cheesy, but honestly who cares?Taking the pens apart to remove the ink is easily done. I really like these pens! I am particular about the pens I use and prefer pens that do not bleed, fine point, and write smoothly.In the past I haven't had the best success with pens that look like these as I find that the tip is too wide and do not write with fluidity. I will be purchasing more of these pens in the future. These pens writes like smooth-writing ball point pens. Plus these pens retract so there&#8217;s no cap to lose.I&#8217;ve been finding myself making color coded grocery lists based on what section of the store each item is in, but a more practical use is with the students I tutor. These pens can be a great motivational and organizational tool for students who need a little encouragement. They have always written very smooth to me and are light pens. I got these pens to help with that process. Okay, so I love pens and office supplies in general. So I&#8217;m always excited to try new colored pens.These are very nice pens with a nice flow. I love colorful pens for work - I use a different color each day of the week to help me keep track of my notes. She loves these pens and reports that they have a very smooth glide and dry immediately. Great pens so far! These pens cost twice as much as the Pilot G2 gel-ink pens. Both the G2 and these Acroball pens are lightweight plastic pens. These are excellent pens for their purpose, are easy on your writing hand, the colors are vivid, and the price will not hurt your wallet. I ordered these pens as part of the Vine program since, as an English professor, I go through a lot of pens each semester, and am always on the hunt for colored pens to use for grading. My absolute favorite pens (which I've been using for at least twelve years) are the Pilot Precise V5 pens (such as these in the multi-pack:Pilot Precise V5 Stick Rolling Ball Pens, Extra Fine Point, 7-Pack Pouch, Assorted Color Inks (26015)), which don't bleed through, and yet still leave a nice, vibrant mark. Great pens! Great pens for those who are tired of writing with black and blue pens or perhaps want to draw. This seems to be about normal for pens in this price range.These are medium tipped pens. I love pens! The pens generally don't smear. These pens are perfect for everyday use and especially for writing on cards. I LOVE these pens, they have just become my choice of Pilot Pens. These pens definitely have a different &#34;feel&#34; when writing, as specified. These Acroball pens are an all-around great pen to write or draw with in fun colors. These are such nice pens in bright colors that I couldn't resist trying them. The pens are retractable, so there are no caps to lose, and the comfort grip helps steady your hand-- I don't know about you, but my handwriting has gotten worse since I've been doing more and more work on a computer, and I need all the help I can get. These pens make handwriting more fun and colorful for everyone. The pens are designed with comfort in mind -- the barrel narrows right where you hold the pen, and the rubber overlay makes the pens easy to hold. The Acroball are definitely one of my favorite pens available on the market today, and they are a bargain for the price. These are comfortable pens to write with.

The Pilot Acroball Colors Retractable Hybrid Gel Ball Point Pens are perfect!I have tried many pens in the past and never found one I like this much.

I was so pleased to not have the pens dribbling, but rather gliding, I almost forgot to notice the great colors!I recommend these pens to students, letter writers (still a few of us out there I'm sure...), and others who have needs such as document signing, sketching and general office use.

You won't be disappointed in these pens.
