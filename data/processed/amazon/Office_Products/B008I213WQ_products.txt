However, unlike most Avery products, there is no readily accessible Word template you can use. So often I review products that are really good physically, but the software support is poor. I love Avery products and this ticket stock is fantastic. Like all of Avery's products, these are wonderful and easy to use. I  cannot compare them to any similar products because this is the only one I have used thus far, but it is absolutely something I will buy in the future!God Bless ~Amy I'm usually very happy with Avery products and theseAvery Tickets with Tear-Away Stubs, 1.75 inches x 5.5 inches, Matte White, Pack of 200 (16154)are good for casual use. )I've used other Avery products before, so the template was pretty simple for me to use; I think the learning curve was steeper when using my first template, though.The thickness of these is like Avery's nametags, a medium weight cardstock not quite as thick as most business cards.These worked well for us! I've used many Avery products in the past, which were mostly labels.

Unlike with many Avery products, they do have downloadable Microsoft Word templates that support these sheets.

I've used & love a LOT of their products.

I've used both of those products and they both work fine.
