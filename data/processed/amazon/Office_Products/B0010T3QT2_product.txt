I would purchase this product w/o reservation. But the product description emphasizes security, and in that regard these are not very good. All in all, it's a decent product. I gave this product 3 stars because I believe it all comes down to affordability. I recommend this product! It would be very obvious if there were any tampering with the sealed product. Overall I am quite satisfied with this product and feel confident recommending for home as well as business use. Amazon has apparently cleaned up their product description and the product I am reviewing is Quality Park's #67012 "Reveal-N-Seal!" What do you say about a simple product? The product works for average uses but is not great for high security needs. As mentioned in the product description, the micro-perforations (running perpendicular to the bottom edge of the envelope flap)  caused the flap to rip. It does drive me to test the product more closely, looking for a fault or bonus that would justify the manufacturer's request for the item to be included in the Vine program.In the end, though, this is an envelope. 'Good product. I got this product for review on a lark pretty much. Altogether this is a well engineered product that I can give five stars to.Patent Analysis:  US 6,732,494 is well written, with one exception, which I will explain. A good product, but I still prefer the type where you remove a strip to expose the adhesive. Myself, I probably will never purchase this product again, but that says more about me and my needs than it does about these envelopes. Fine product if you need it. But not with this product. Yes, they self seal, but as far as being able to tell if they are opened, not that great of a product. Great product! I find them to be a quality product, if only a bit expensive. I was only going to give this product 4 stars ---  I mean, they are white self-seal security printed business size envelopes (and not overly cheap).On second thought, I'll consider some of the details:  1. Get this product! Very good product. Great product!

This product has a very narrow strip of adhesive (about a third the size of the AMPAD's adhesive strip) that is covered by part of the envelope itself.

Even once this product was closed and sealed, it was ridiculously easy to open!!

I'm very happy with this product.
