Any large-format photo printer like this will not be compact in size, and this Pro-100's size of 27.2"x8.6"x15.2" (Width-Height-Depth) needs extra room on a desk or table. For a photo of people surrounded by colorful scenery, I often slightly decrease the saturation just on the skin areas while letting the surrounding background stay the same. This large dedicated photo printer takes up a lot of room but delivers beauty in return. The photo was not particularly sharp or well framed but it had sentimental value. Compared the PRO-100 photo to the professional Shutterfly print, and while not identical, I preferred the more vibrant coloring of the PRO-100 print over the Shutterfly print!Setup was simple enough.I'm amazed at how heavy this printer is and how large it is. I am just astounded how great this photo looks. You would never imagine it was a digital photo of a 39 year old slide. The Canon Luster photo paper is very expensive.Another neat accessory allows you to put images onto inkjet printable disks. Recently we have gone on photo shoots and collected many fine digital pictures with semi-professional cameras. The photo printer I had been using is an old bubble jet. Instead I have been using the local Walgreens to do my photo printing and they do a decent job although I prefer having the added control my own printer would provide. I've been using online photo services for printing my photos, and a reasonably decent inkjet "all-in-one" for the rest, but decided to try this Canon PIXMA PRO-100 as an alternative.So, given that, let's get started --UNLOADING and SETTING UP --First, you need to understand that this thing is SERIOUSLY big and heavy. This is especially true on the glossy photo paper. But all in all, its is a great photo printer and it is able to print many different photo sizes. Crisp & vibrant photo's I'm producing using this pro-100 printer.Bought this mainly because of dpi increase from my hp 8300series.You can tell a big huge difference.Wanted to print larger format pictures, & my canon 5320 printer only print up to 8.5 x 11.5.Now compared to both canon printers... there is little difference.The 5320 in my opinion matches the pro 100 pretty evenly. Which means I'm about to go on a very large photo printing jag to get some of these family snapshots out to my grandparents and distantly located relatives.I snapped up the Canon PIXMA PRO-100 having very little experience with the brand other than an ancient point-and-shoot Powershot camera that I still use fairly regularly. Very hard to tell these were not done in a photo studio.
