The dividers are in a range of attractive, transparent to translucent colors: very light yellow, orange, very light blue, bright blue, and light green. Great dividers, solid and clear, should stand up to heavy use.In addition to the colored dividers there is a white one with a large pocket where letter sized paper sheets or forms fit nicely.I found them very useful for my projects. Thus, the dividers are transparent so that you can see the &#34;tabs&#34; at the back.4. Therefore, I tried these dividers out and loved 'em. Good dividers play a big part in that system. These dividers appear to be durable and provide an attractive tool for home, office or school. These dividers are great quality. I didn't realize this when I ordered them, but these dividers do not come with the typical print and slide in the tab labels. These dividers were very useful for organizing some documents in a neat and professional manner. I really love these view-tab dividers and definitely will put them to good use.FEATURES:&#9658;  5-tab set&#9658;  Dividers are extra-wide to allow for oversize sheets or use with sheet protectors&#9658;  Tabs are transparent multicolor and square in shape&#9658;  Polypropylene tab divider material is durable enough for frequent reuse&#9658;  Create custom tabs and print all tab titles on one sheet with one-step formatting at wilsonjones.com/templatesWILSON JONES:Wilson Jones View-Tab Transparent DividersWilson Jones WorkStyle Erasable-Tab Index DividersWilson Jones Cut and Sewn Binder, Round RingsWilson Jones WorkStyle Cut and Sewn Round Ring BinderWilson Jones Minute Book, Bound, Locking SpineWilson Jones Ring Ledger Sheets, 5 x 8.5 InchesWilson Jones 362 Basic Round Ring View BinderWilson Jones ColumnWrite Columnar PadWilson Jones 812 Telephone Address Book, Round RingWilson Jones Ring Ledger Binder, 1 Inch Capacity, 5.5 x 8.5 Inch Size, Blue First of all the dividers are heavy duty and extend out past the standard dividers. these are excellent sturdy dividers made to work with contents that are in sheet protectors. It should be noted that the dividers -do not- have the usual construction to insert paper labels. Secondly, the dividers are much thicker than usual, have five light-colored tab dividers along with a title page holder and a protective cover. I've been using the dividers for about a week and they seem like they will hold up well. These are great dividers. Standard dividers are not wide enough to be seen past the extra width of page protectors since they are designed to work with hole punched LETTER sized paper.This is a great product that is also very durable. Most tab dividers do not reach to the edges of page protectors.These are great. I loved the durable dividers and the title page and cover protector. I've tried other dividers and I've been troubled by how thin they are. The Wilson Jones View-Tab Transparent Dividers, Extra Wide, 5-Tab Set, Multicolor Square Tabs (W55069) are by far the best dividers I've used because they are sturdy and truly extra wide. The extra-wide dividers are made out of a rather thick but transparent plastic. All five dividers are colored, and the colors are kind of bland and gender-neutral: clear, blue, green, light orange, and yellow - very good for business applications. I really like that these dividers won't tear. These dividers are exactly what I wanted. The dividers are extra-wide, too, which means I can see the whole divider label even when the binder is full of papers. These dividers are durable, and have colored tabs...and what is a huge plus is a divider to place at the end of your book, it's a big wider than the others and made so you can print labels for each of your tabs which will show through each tab due to the fact that they are transparent.....very cool.These dividers/tabs are a bit wider than your regular sized paper, so will be visible when your book is open or closed instead of hidden between the pages.A very unique design, and one that I think will last, the tabs are not going to get pulled off. While I like having dividers and being organized, I don't like typing those little paper tabs so I don't use them, and things generally get shoved in the binder in no particular order. Great dividers! These are great dividers. All dividers are transparent with different colors. The dividers are thick and sturdy, so I don't think I would damage them if I push the binder a bit too much towards the wall when I put it away on a bookshelf, I don't know. I like how these dividers work because it simplifies the printing of the tabs and the finished result is very clean. If you want to put in more dividers, you have to have two sets of sheets and it gets a little unwieldy.The dividers themselves are quite attractive and the right size to stick out. Well thought of designed dividers made to make filing easier. but I digress.The dividers are wide enough to be seen beyond the width of the sheet protector, and the tab for the description is also wider than the dividers I've been familiar with in the past, easily allowing for two lines of computer generated text. The dividers are heavy plastic, which I imagine will make them almost indestructible in our usage. It's nice having Extra-Wide dividers so that you can actually see the tabs when using other, wider binder inserts such as sheet protectors. Since these dividers are wider than your typical sheet protectors, that should no longer be an issue.
