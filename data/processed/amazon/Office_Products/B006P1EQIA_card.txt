This card stock is much stronger than the type that I have purchased previously. I also used this card stock to print out signs for the party.I can see us using this card stock for other needs. Will be buying more of this card stock paper! This card stock is one of the best I have used BUT, AFTER GETTING THEM 4 DAYS LATE. I love this card stock and I already need to order some more. The usual card I bought was 65lb, and I was happy with that. So I was hesitant about getting this card at 110lb. But now that I have seen this card, there is very little difference between them both. This card stock works great for both.It takes the ink well using acrylic or rubber stamps with both water- and alcohol-based inks. This card stock is particularly great for that purpose. This card stock is great. I use it for making card bases for my handmade cards.
