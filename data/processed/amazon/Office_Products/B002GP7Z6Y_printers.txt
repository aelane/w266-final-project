I own 2 HP printers before, 2 Epson and now 2 Canon Printers. I am hoping this newer printers ink type is a little more efficient and I like the two black ink tanks. It is much heavier the Epson printers and the depth is a lot more then you realize at home. I couldn't replace my other printers in for photo and might have to get a better scanner for photo also. Other printers don't require that you buy color ink to print black and white which makes sense. No more Canon printers for me..... And you may need back up printers. Refurbished printers are also on the market due to a high quantity of machines that were discarded due to error messages. Most printers have this these days, but not all.> The paper tray is on the bottom and lays flat in the tray then feeds up into the machine. This is standard in most printers these days.> When set on the high resolution settings you can get extremely clear and large details. Most printers are these days.I'm struggling to think of anything else that I like about it, that's special.
