The tab is large but you can see text through it. I purchased some tab dividers, but each page takes up precious space. You can write both on the tab and on the transparent part that adheres to your paper. I put a tab on each map, with the name of the map in pencil on the tab, and the book is MUCH easier to folllow now. The tab is colored and the main body is clear with sticky backing. The tab and large block are one piece and cannot be seperated (without the use of scissors anyhow).Unlike most of Avery's other tabs, these can be reused more often. The actual tab part is heavy card stock and you can write on it. A large clear adheasive tab attaches to the paper. A tab divider size tab then sticks out for indexing. Writable on both tab and body surfaces. It's nice to not have to remove the tab to see my lesson plans. Writing on the tab is not a problem. The little tab on top of each note is nice because it acts as an indexing tool or a bookmark. There is a 2" tab that is opaque that acts as a bookmark or page-turner. I use the tab to note a place in a book then use the square surface to note how I see implanting the information into the project.These are fairly thick and durable. The tab is erasable if you use a pencil but pen/marker does not wipe off. we got a few different Averi tab products for my 7th grader to use at school as dividers in her binders. The opaque tab means that it really can only be used to mark the edge of the paper, but the smaller tab makes more sense for this purpose. I want a tab to mark the edge of the page, not change the appearance of what's on that page. Having the tab is a plus to find the note quickly.If you have a similar use for this size, I recommend it. The tab has a paper surface that can absorb liquid ink for more permanent marking.
