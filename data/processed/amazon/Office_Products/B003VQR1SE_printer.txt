This printer does a good job printing pictures. I actually thought the printer had stopped working at a point, but eventually the page was printed and  we got it. I give the printer 3 stars for printing.so average is  4 stars. So it's rather nice to have one included with the printer. But where this printer really shines is in printing photos. Overall, I think this is a great printer and I'm amazed at the price. My current printer was a Lexmark but they finally got tired of providing me replacement printers for ones that stopped working before the 1 year warranty ran out. My Lexmark printer cost just under $30 and had a 1 year warranty while this one cost $60 and had a 90 day warranty. Yes, I just bought this little printer at Walmart for $29.00 & got a free  4 GB Flash Drive with the purchase. This is a good overall printer at a value-price.

This printer is made for everyday printing, not hanging museum-quality prints on the wall.

(At least, I couldn't see them)It would be easy to say you get what you pay for here, since this is a $70 printer, but it's a little better than that.

This printer has quite a few unexpected features.
