As address labels go, these do exactly what you need them to do, and are environmentally friendly to boot. 3M Permanent Adhesive Recycled Address Labels, 1 x 2 5/8", White, 750 per Pack (3700-A)3M Address Label 3700-A Printing MediaI really like the 3M address labels. But, I needed some new address labels, so I gave these a try.They seem to be as good as any others I have used, but they don't seem any better. Now I will never run out of address labels again with this handy pack of 750 labels. These 3M address labels print up the same as regular ones. Still ok for using as an address label. When you want standard address labels, you want them to be big enough to print your address on them, and to be more or less white. For address on the letters, I prefer to use the stamper instead of label. What can you say about address labels? What is there to say about address labels? Much more than the average address label package!I highly recommend this product and give it my.......Thumbs Up award! Great self-adhesive address labels.
