The retractable badge reel is a lot more comfortable to place on pants, skirts, etc.I like the different colors, and suppose that one can match the different outfits with them, but I prefer to attach the badge to a reel and use it until it breaks. I am required to wear a badge for work. These GBC badge reels are attractive, seemingly durable, and useful. If you need to swipe or show a badge to get through a door, these work great.If you were hoping to clip it to a lanyard or something, look elsewhere.The metal clip on the back is fine for clipping to your belt or to a pocket. These badge reels by Swingline are a mood lifting addition to my drab work badge. I'm required to wear an ID badge at work. You pull your badge out, scan it on the sensor at the door, and let go of the badge and feel the comforting "fwap" as it reels back and hits you in the hip. However, since it would be absolutely dreadful if I lost my badge, I wish I could pay a couple bucks more for an even better build. They hold up just as well as any other badge holders we've ever used.One of them did break after only a couple of weeks - but the rest are still going strong. These little badge reels are made of a fairly sturdy plastic and have a very efficient reel mechanism, so they retract easily and fast. But I recommend it for any ID badge use, whether it is on the job or something for the kids at school. I've gone through several badge holders in the 10 years at my job. Although these retractable badge holders make life easier,  they are not quite the quality I expect to hold a secure badge. Personally I would invest more in a single retractable badge holder. So really, if you are looking for a badge holder for yourself and think it would be nice to have a few extras, I would look around a bit and maybe not get these. This retractable badge reel fixes that - and this comes with 5 to share with your co-workers. These are very practical and sturdy badge and ID holders. These badge reels work well at what they do. I like the Swingline retractable badge reel because of the translucent colors and there are 5 colors to choose from. They are just as sturdy as the average badge reel and no advertising logos! These retractable badge reels are so great to have on hand. I don't have to scan my badge for anything, but another nice feature if you do have to is that there is a stretch cord so you won't have to take it off. I used many of these retractable badge reels. I like these badge reels a lot. Where I work you need a badge to do anything....go to the copier, bathroom, kitchen...so a badge reel is indispensable. I not only use these for my badge (for which they work well) but I also use them to attach to things I do not want to forget. My ID badge, protective sleeve and desk key really don't weigh much but I have to make sure the Swingline reel is retracted when I'm done using the badge / keys.
