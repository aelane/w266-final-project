This printer is the primary copier, primary color printer, and primary fax machine in our engineering office with six professionals. As a printer, this is good at black and white, but standard color settings yield extremely washed out documents. I also tried the included printer CCB, picasa, windows photo gallery, etc. I'll never buy another HP printer as long as I live, but boy am I happy with this Brother! I wish there was a printer with all these features at less than 50 lbs packaged. If you don't care about that, this printer is great in every other way. This printer works very well as described by other reviewers. If the printer goes to sleep, it then takes about 30 seconds to print the first page. Then I realized that using it as serial printer was prohibitively expensive - cost of 3 Brother printer ribbons bought me a new Citizen dot matrix printer!In 1993 Brother came out with one of the first, if not the first, laser multifunctions which I purchased. This printer will do anything you want. I purchased this printer to replace an inkjet printer that wasn't working for my application. The printer does take a while to warm up but the print and processing speed is plenty fast enough for our needs.Be careful with toner.
