The notebook is printed on heavy paper. This notebook allows you to place questions or thoughts away from the main note taking task in a yellow box at the bottom of the page.If one is just taking notes the Cambridge notebook with the line down the page may be better; however, if you are somewhere that will allow questions or where you may receive a specific assignment - during a meeting for example - this notebook will work very well because the yellow space at the bottom of the page can be used for thoughts, questions or assignments without interfering with the main notes being taken.Excellent all round idea.Heavy paper and a tough cover made from thin flexible plastic. I love this notebook! I love this notebook. But with this notebook, it has this great highlighted space to jot all that down. Like, a BUNCH.This notebook is firmly in the middle of the pack. Much like the other Mead Cambridge notebook I bought, this is a really good idea and decent quality, but something about the execution makes it feel a little off.Good points:- Perforated pages makes it easy to tear off your notes and file them appropriately after meetings.- Yellow &#34;Quick Notes&#34; section at the bottom makes it easy to highlight key info or separate subjects- Header at the top has spots and prompts for page and date, making it easy to organize your work- Subtle dotted lines down the left conveniently create a spot for numbered lists, checking off to-do's, etc.Not so great:- The &#34;Quick Notes&#34; logo in the top left corner looks weird and unprofessional- Between the header and yellow section at the bottom, the proper lines in the middle look squished and would be hard to read if you took a lot of notes.- The cover is a weird material. This is a great little notebook, especially helpful for people like me who have to go to lots of meetings and take lots of notes. This notebook really isn't anything special, in my opinion. However, I think that a college-ruled notebook page (especially a 5-Star oversize notebook-style page) looks more professional/business than the pages inside the notebook. This notebook is good for just about anything you need to track when/if you don't have a computer available. You could also do that with standard notebook ... but this one is kind of cool. This notebook comes with a higher grade paper that works with any pen I have tried - ball point, felt tip, fine-point Sharpie (by the way, these are really nice pens), fountain pens and pencils, regular and mechanical. This notebook gives you a page with a nice straight edge.Recommended. I have never seen a notebook set up like the Mead Cambridge Limited Quick Notes Business Notebook. However, it is a nice notebook. Mead's Cambridge Limited QuickNotes Business Notebook is a normal, high-quality notebook with one novelty - the bottom 1/3 of each page is yellow and labeled as a QuickNotes area. Overall this is a pretty handy notebook for business folks and busy people. The notebook is also spiral bound, features a handsome heavy cover, and the pages are perforated to ensure a clean tear if needed. The Mead Cambridge Limited QuickNotes Business Notebook (6066)  is a sturdy notebook and offers the Quicknotes layout which I am a big fan of. It's a very nice notebook where each page is organized and color-coded with a small blue box at the top for your page description and date at the top; about two-thirds of the page is regular, standard-ruled notebook lines, and the bottom third of the page is a quick notes section in yellow where you can jot down action items or anything requiring special attention.During meetings I'm a compulsive note taker. I initially thought this notebook would include not only the Quicknotes, but also the itemized chart pages and regular lined pages as shown in one of the item photos, unfortunately, it's just the Quicknotes.I've used Mead's Quicknotes in the past and they worked well for client and office meetings, however, the this new version is not as well-designed. This is definitely a well-made notebook -- the spiral hasn't started to lose its shape at all, the cover is adequate protection against the occasional water droplet, and the paper is fairly nice quality. Overall, a good notebook for my kitchen. Let me first of by stating that if you are looking for a notebook to write down general notes, save yourself the money and get a basic notebook. Otherwise, just use a regular notebook. But for such a LARGE notebook, there really isn't enough SPACE for writing. Additionally, when you have the notebook open the colors are so bright that it loses a lot of the 'professional' feel that it has when you're just seeing the simple textured black cover.Bottom line: I like the idea, and I'll use it, but the product could use some improvement. Love this notebook for taking notes for our monthly business meetings at work.

I'd be fine using the notebook for taking notes in school, but, honestly, I don't think the page format looks professional enough for an office.If Mead continues to make this notebook, I'd recommend they keep the format with multiple sections but get rid of the &#34;Quick Notes&#34; labels.
