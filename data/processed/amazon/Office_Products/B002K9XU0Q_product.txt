This is one Vine product I not only liked, but will end up purchasing regularly. This product has become one of my &#34;must have&#34; office supplies! All in all, this is a product that delivers. This product is a great alternative to wasting storage folders. This product saves you both money and time since you will no longer need to run to the store to buy new folders, you can just recycle the old ones. I highly recommend this product. It's a nice product. I've a little reluctant to review this product until now. I think if they want to make a truly effective product they will need to step there game up a bit more.Conclusion:In the end though I was still able to remove all the label, even if it did require a little extra help. So seeing this new product had me curious.I immediately downloaded - or at least I followed the instructions to download the MMM template from their website. This is a great product. I would recommend this product wholeheartedly. This product allows us to remove the label cleanly and reuse the folder. The product is very convenient and "green." Neat product!! This is a great product to use, if you will not be needing the file folder for a long period of time/specific subject. I thought I would absolutely love this product when I first heard that such *removable* file folder labels existed because, like many others, I have my fair share of folders with multiple stacked-on labels. With this product, you get 25 sheets per pack, 30 removable labels per sheet. Hindsight as it is, I finally realized that this product is created for folders that live in cabinets... because if you allow your folders to wear (as in my situation), these labels do *not* stay in their place for very long. Just like the product name indicates, the labels are sticky and removable. After searching by product ID number, the download was straightforward, but the download did not automatically show up in my templates folder on my OS 10.6 Mac. However, the product itself is excellent. This product enables me re-use folders. A great product and when these run out I will buy more. Overall a very good product that does what it says it will. Just as the product discription states....these go on easily and can be removed without a problem. Here we have another great product by Post It! Wonderful product that no office space should be without! This product is Superb to begin with.I jut got a label maker earlier this week and I guessed there was no harm trying this one too.For starters....u dont need batteries to run this.You can just write on it and stick them on any surface.Easy to peel and stickEasy to use with a printer if u have a long list of labels to start with.Plenty of labels for the moneyMay need you to log on to ur comp for prints but I just write on them too.I use them with files and folders and labeling anything under the sun..Really versatile.Great Product. I love this product, they are perfect for using on files and binders. Such a simple product but it makes my life easier. The Amazon product page says "0.6 X 3.4 Inches." Very happy with this product. Overall I am happy with the product. This is a product that does what it says it'll do.I haven't put them in my computer because I don't need a whole sheet of file folder labels, I doubt many people do.I basically hand write the labels and put them on folders to take to class with me. I rated this product with four stars for two reason:  1) Few people label file folders any more because they using hanging folders and 2) The size of the label is too big to be used on much else (those are personal preferences). )This product is an excellent value for the price. Pretty good product.
