They have self-stick adhesive for sealing with ease. )The adhesive is sticky to the touch, but clean. Long lasting adhesive. How long does the adhesive have to last to get a document from here to there!?3. The adhesive is VERY sticky and seals immediately, and the flap is scored like an old-fashioned price tag, so there's no way to get inside without destroying the flap. The adhesive does seal well when new so you don't have to use tape to further secure the envelope. I don't know how well the adhesive will last over time if the envelopes aren't used in the near future. Long lasting adhesive!" The self-sealing adhesive is convenient (no moisture or strips to peel off) and the evelopes hold up very well through mailing. When I have peel-and-seal I want standard adhesive and when I have to do a bunch of licking, I go the other way. :-)The adhesive is under a flap of paper, rather than a peel-away strip. With theReveal-N-Seal Envelope, the adhesive is brought into position by folding up a pre-folded flap. The adhesive is stronger than the paper of the envelope. The claimed 3-year adhesive shelf life will be a boon if true; I usually avoid self-adhesive envelopes because the adhesive dries up in about a year. Not so with these Quality Park envelopes, since the adhesive is actually covered by a fold down flap. The self-stick adhesive is on under a lower flap that must be flipped up to join the envelope flap. Allegedly, the adhesive has a superior 3 year shelf life (it certainly seems strong enough).
