The scissors themselves are great. We ended up storing the scissors elsewhere. These are perfectly good scissors for learning the fine art of cutting. What I love most about these scissors is the "Microban Technology.This technology protection the growth of microorganisms on the surface of the scissors that cause stains, odors and product degradation. The scissors themselves are fantastic - easy to grip with a smooth cut for little hands. These Westcott scissors are perfect for children and adults, too. Nice scissors! I recommend these scissors for anyone that has children. These scissors are great because they contain Microban antimicrobial protection that fights the growth of stain-causing and order-causing bacteria, which is especially important for classrooms of kids using the scissors! There are twelve scissors with handles in four bright, almost neon colors:  pink, orange, blue and green, so your child's scissor choice can match his or her favorite color or mood at the moment.This would be an especially good set for school or daycare use as they are quite durable for frequent use and the set is reasonably priced to allow you to get enough to go around. These scissors easily cut smoothly through regular paper, newspaper, construction paper and light card stock. These scissors are suited well for either hand preference! I couldn't get it to stay together very well so I just stored my scissors elsewhere. These scissors are very safe and they actually work, too :) My daughter likes the colors, and we use them for arts and crafts. Sturdy, kid-size scissors in a set that includes a variety of colors to prevent (okay, reduce) arguments at the table. The scissors have a thumb hole and a larger hole for several fingers, and they easily switch from left- to right-hand use. The Westcott Soft Handle Scissors are the perfect scissors for the little toothless wonders as they start school. Neither will the scissors: they are sharp enough for plenty of paper, cloth, string or yarn, only the tips are blunt so you won't poke your eyes out (still, don't run with them!). The Westcott scissors are just the right size to fit her small hands and the multi-colored handles entices her more to cut paper in different shapes and sizes. I must emphasize though that these are still scissors, even with a blunt tip, they still have sharp edges and strict adult supervision is a must for pre-schoolers to avoid any kind of injury or accident. "Wait, Mom, I'll get my scissors and open it." It is harrowing watching him work the scissors, but I keep a close eye on him. I love these scissors for three reasons. These blunt-tipped scissors are great for children.The blunt-tip makes them safe for young ones, and the soft grip is very comfortable.What I most liked about these scissors was that they are not your typical too-dull-to-cut-anything kids scissors. These scissors work for both left and right handed children, are well made, and have the added benefit of Microban Protection, which inhibits the growth of bacteria on the handles - a definite plus in any school room. Each the scissors perfectly sized for little hands, come in an assortment of bright colors (same colors as pictured), and cuts with ease. These scissors can be used easily by left or right handed kids. Although we're all right-handed, these scissors are supposed to work for left-handed kids as well. I love, love, love these little scissors. These scissors are top of the line for kids scissors! I bought these scissors, so I would have extras in my classroom. I especially like that these scissors offer antimicrobial protection that fights the growth of stain-causing and order-causing bacteria. I'll give these scissors a mild recommendation, but the product is not without issues. First off, when they arrived, most of the scissors had come loose inside the packaging; the "Storage Rack" they come with is simply very cheap, pull apart plastic and does not hold them in place well at all. The scissors definitely have small, child-sized blades and handles. These scissors apparently contain "Microban" technology, an "antimicrobial ingredient to prevent microorganisms from degrading the product," which is nice for messy, hectic classrooms, if it really works. It seems that scissors grow legs in my house and run out the door never to be seen again so I was excited to see this offered in amazon vine. Still, the scissors are very well built and very likely to last a long time, even with the abuse they tend to get from kids using them.Westcott claims, as well, that the material resists microbes. I used to buy cheap scissors for children, until I realized how poorly some of them cut. Now that I've tried Westcott, Fiskars has a serious contender.These scissors cut so well. Most importantly, the scissors cut smoothly through paper; they do cut kinda choppy through heavier cardstock though.The only downside to this product is that it says on the box it comes with a storage rack for the scissors, but the rack is useless because it's such thin plastic and the snaps don't lock into place to hold it together. Very satisfied with the scissors for their intended use. She was so excited to see the Westcott scissors that I offered to given them to her on the single condition that she report back with an evaluation. These are well designed scissors that are easy and comfortable for children and adults to use. Perfect scissors! The scissors themselves are sturdy, cut clean, and are ready for a lot of use! The scissors have excellent grip, cut through single sheets of paper with ease. I am forever hunting scissors so I've made good use of this multi-pack. These are great scissors and the color variety is fun. The scissors open easy, but not too easy, and are not difficult at all to use.T
