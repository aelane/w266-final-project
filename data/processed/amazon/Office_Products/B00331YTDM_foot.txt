When I really need to flex my foot, I stick it out and rotate the ankle a few times. Using this foot rocker under that desk was uncomfortable because even my short legs bumped against the tray. This foot rest has removed that restlessness.An earlier reviewer referred to noise coming from the footrest. I've been using the foot rocker for a few weeks now. It works best as a foot toy...as in it is something to move and creak when you are sitting still for long periods of time. This foot rocker, however, could use some improvements.The rocker was relatively easy to put together but I can see the need for clearer instructions. While this foot stool lacks some of the height and angle adjustability of others I've used, it more than makes up for it by enabling a rocking motion when using it. The Fellowes foot rocker is nice for support. They claim that the foot rocker helps reduce leg pressure, improve circulation, and reduce fatigue. This simple foot rest serves its purpose, period. She's had foot massages in no less than five different countries and tried many types, including Shiatsu, Reflexology, Thai, Deep Tissue and foot massage machines. I'd never really thought about putting a foot rocker below my desk, but it's completely changed the way I position myself at work. I imagine you could also accomplish this by banging the extended foot portion against the carpeted floor. I normally use a foot stool at my home computer desk, but was looking for something a bit smaller and a device with a rocking motion to ease my boredom. This foot rocker allows me to do the same tapping motion, but do it silently. Also note that my stationary foot stool I was using before had to be adjusted a lot with my "sitting style" as well.Bottom line:If you sit at a desk all day, you may be surprised at how much more comfortable it is to have the option to put your feet on something just a few inches high.

I have two other foot rockers that are purely flat on top, so you can manuever your feet around a lot.The edges make me have to keep my feet inside.

I'd like to evaluate this on how it works as a foot rest, however, I am not able to get the wheels to lock into place.

Assembling this foot rocker can be a little confusing.
