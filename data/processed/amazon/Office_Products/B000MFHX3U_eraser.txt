My other eraser is really hard to use in small spaces and I find things accidentally erased all the time.These also do a great job of removing stubborn marker. Much better than our old eraser. As of yet, I have not had to wet the eraser to get rid of ink - I've just had to put a little muscle into the scrubbing. We just use this eraser on our small family "white board" where we jot notes, reminders, lists, etc.We found that the white side of the marker is better at removing dry-erase markers than the blue side...who knows why.It's nice to have this around so now we don't have to use a finger, tissue, or paper towel to wipe the board clean.What else is there to say? Like I said, they are definitely superior to the average whiteboard eraser. This eraser when wet cleaned even the most persistent stains. No, so I say buy the cheapest magic eraser and it will clean whiteboards, walls, or whatever just as well as this one. This is the first eraser I have found that cleans everything from the dry erase board. The eraser is a little wide for my hands, but is a bit small for my husband's, so it should be fine for people with 'normal' sized hands (and it does squish a bit, so it is not too uncomfortable for smaller hands). A special eraser for a dry erase board might seem unnecessary, but I've always hated how messy it is to use a paper towel; little flecks get everywhere! But be aware that your eraser might not last very long, especially if you will frequently be using it wet. The eraser is odorless and doesn't seem to pick up marker smells (but I haven't tried it with the Expo Scents). I like this eraser because it is effective at erasing dry erase markers without a spray cleaner. They are pretty much like other eraser pads that can do household cleaning chores, so I knew what to expect. The eraser worked well on both. Rub eraser on blackboard. This eraser also does a good job of getting off marker print that is a week or more old - and leaves no residue. But here we have an eraser that actually works on these older marks. So this eraser works as promised. But this eraser will replace our existing and mostly useless erasers. I also cut the eraser in half to reduce it's profile on my desk when in use. I was using a conventional eraser before but I will no longer after using this one. The 3M Whiteboard eraser leaves no dusty residue behind like what I had been using previously. I  found the eraser to be sponge like and is just the right dimensional size to fit right into your hand.This eraser has been able to remove marks left on boards for over several months with ease. I did however damped the eraser to test it out and found that it in return dried moderately quickly and removed any markings simply off the board I was using (though it wasn't needed).The 3M Whiteboard eraser works effectively well leaving no smears, streaks, or dust behind. the dry eraser easily wiped away months of black and red dry erase marker. the eraser, even when wet, couldn't seem to fully erase the red dry-erase writing that had been on for the past month or so. I would definitely recommend this eraser over the traditional type if the price was comparable. AMAZiNGLY, after I wet this eraser, with a little scrub I was able to completely remove that obnoxious mark from my board! This eraser should hold up well to white board use. I must admit when I saw how well the eraser did on the whiteboards, I attacked the tables,  permanent markings, glue, dirt and all. I really didn't believe that this eraser was going to be able to erase permanent marker off of a whiteboard, but it really did! Well, this eraser is your answer. This eraser cleans a whiteboard efficiently and smoothly.It has a gentle texture and like most 3M products functions well.I found cheaper and whiteboard erasers that were just as good, but did cost less. They are all pretty similar after all and I don't think I'll stick to this eraser as I've gotten them for less, although I will use them until they wear out. - Used this eraser in Hask Universities Philosophy & religion class .. many people ... from Jewish Rabies, Catholics and other sorts debated the virtues of Heaven & Hell, or lack of either. First I tried the eraser, dry, in our corporate setting. The eraser can be rinsed clean if you desire, although it really isn't necessary. When I got this I wondered how well it would work as compared to the "magic eraser" foam cleaning pads that I normally use when I am cleaning my white boards. I find this eraser more convenient than keeping both an eraser and a cleansing spray near my whiteboard. I tried out this 3M eraser on the board and found that it does clean better than a regular whiteboard eraser but it still couldn't remove those old residue marks when moistened.This eraser is sponge-like, having one side that has the eraser surface and the other side (colored blue) for your grip. I was hoping that this eraser would work better than paper towels.I use theBIC Great Erase Grip "Pocket" Dry Erase Marker, Fine Point, Assorted, 6 Dry Erase Markers (GDEP61-Ast)to write on the board. I can recommend this eraser highly because it works as advertised and needs absolutely no chemical or liquid other than H2O. This is a whiteboard eraser, made if a blue sponge glued to a white sponge. And, it erases about as good as any other eraser that I've usedPros* it works* can easily wash the dry ink dust out of it (I used a little dish-washing soap, and just worked it a little, and it came clean)Cons* even with great Amazon pricing, it sort of expensive for 2 sponges (these are not that fancy)* no handle, so you are holding the sponge (I used the white side to clean, and used the blue side to hold onto it) Yet when I used this eraser it all came off with relative ease. Dry, they don't work much better than a regular reusable eraser, and wet, they work about as well as a paper towel and cleaning spray. If you prefer smearing to clumping, get this eraser. Not so with this 3M eraser, not even on markings that have been on the board for a while. This eraser is much better than the eraser that came with it, which was Styrofoam with some kind of fiber material on the bottom. This 3M eraser is more like a sponge and it really seems to suck up the dry erase marker 'ink' rather than just spreading it off to either side. These are a great eraser for the price. My eraser was getting most of the newest writing off but not some spots that had built up. I was getting ready to look for a new eraser when this one became available. I had to wash the eraser out in water 3 times because it cleaned up so much it got black even though my colors were only blue, red, and green. The eraser rinsed out clean. This eraser does a great job. I greatly prefer these "eraser pads" to the traditional felt-style dry erasers. They are similar to a magic eraser, but not abrasive enough to scratch your whiteboard. As soon as I received the 3M whiteboard eraser I just assumed it was similar to the standard eraser we had as well as those Mr. Clean Magic pads that my wife uses around the house (something I never thought of trying with the whiteboard..hmm....). This a soft, comfortable to hold eraser that made my white board white again. It didn't come off when I used the eraser dry. However, after wetting the eraser, the permanent ink came off pretty easily. If you've ever used a Mr Clean magic eraser, you'll recognize this item right out of the box. This eraser did a very good job erasing tough markers after being moistened. When I saw this new 3M eraser, I looked forward to better results than my current choices.Overall, as a general whiteboard eraser these erase quite well. This eraser may look like a sponge, but it doesn't hold water like one. It's possible that the micro-abrasive eraser (I assume) could make the board more susceptible for future ghosting (by having removed some of the finish - I'm totally guessing here). This eraser is very effective. This eraser is a good alternative to the sprays.I used the eraser on week old marker ink. I first tried the eraser on an old white board that I have had hanging on my fridge for years. I was really hoping that this eraser would clean the board and make it less of an eyesore. However, the 3M eraser completely removed permanent ink whereas there was still a shadow of the ink left after using the Mr Clean sponge.Since the Mr Clean Magic Eraser works well on other surfaces besides a whiteboard, I would not recommend purchasing the 3M Whiteboard Eraser if you will have only dry erase/wet erase markers to clean up. This eraser did somewhat better than a dry paper towel at erasing all the marks. It truly is a decent "dry" eraser, and does a good job without messy spray cleaners or water. I'm not sure how long each eraser will last after wetting it and using it. This eraser works much better than any other whiteboard eraser I've tried. I could even feel the eraser working. But I wouldn't recommend it as an everyday eraser just because of the ergonomic. This eraser did a fantastic job on all three - they're truly whiteboards again! This 3M eraser does a phenomenal job of cleaing whiteboards. No more, this little eraser cleans up the mess very quickly.Sure most anything will clean it fast when the ink is on the board for short periods of time, this seems to work when the ink is left on for days.I like to use a whiteboard for my sewing and knitting to keep count and to allow me to write things while watching TV, every surface I use my dry erase pens on come off clean with this little eraser.
