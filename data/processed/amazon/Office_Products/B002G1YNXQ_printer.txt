This printer is ideal for printing on the go. I purchased this printer to replace my Epson Picturemate. I see this as a printer to use if one doesn't own a computer or to take to a party and print photos on the spot to give to friends. I've enjoyed this printer tremendously; in fact, I've traveled with it by car on two long distance trips. When my in-laws came to visit us, I set the printer up outside on a small plastic deck table (near an outside power outlet) and printed family photos. You cannot take this printer to the beach or a park unless you use a converter and hook it up in your vehicle.#2 - The printing time is slow - each 4x6 print takes 1 minute, 30 seconds to print. I am enjoying the printer, and I use it far more than my other printers because it's fun to take to events and print off photos for friends and family. Nice printer. The printer needs only an inch or so clearance behind, and a few inches in front (for the paper guide and output). The printer has software built into it for 32-bit Vista and XP. The printer detected the iPhone 3gs but the iPhone did not see this device at all. This printer is no different. However, there is a TRICK - once installed, unplug the printer, plug it back in, and run the SETUP on the printer itself...it will detect that you have new drivers loaded and set the printer up in Windows 7 x64. Plug the printer in and go to System Preferences.

Where to begin, this printer has a lot to cover and I'm not going to hit everything.I think foremost of importance is how does the print quality look.

When you turn on the printer for the first time it will walk you through setup right on the screen which is nice.

It is what the printer comes in.
