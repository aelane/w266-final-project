However, I fear that the cheap plastic exterior will mean this pencil will not last as long as I would like it to. All plastic means there's no chance of silicone or rubber wearing out/expanding and falling off/getting sticky/staining.There is a "high grade" Roulette version with a better build quality. ), the smooth plastic barrel is a bit slippery, and the dinky, wobbly eraser does not impress. It has a black plastic tube and a wide curved pocket clip with a narrow circular pressure point. It also has a plastic clip that is not to my liking. Instead, I cut out the plastic section they arrived in and taped up the back to keep them inside it. Through the clear plastic near the tip you can see the uni-ball logo moving a little each time.The only drawback is the eraser. It feels very sturdy and not like the cheap plastic ones that snap and crack easily. While the plastic clip on this unit is sturdier than the cheapy models, it still is plastic. First, the plastic cap that covers the eraser is the first thing that I can loose, I cannot really see the point in even putting it on the pencil. The Uni-Ball has an integrally molded-in plastic clip that alternates between screaming themes of "Cheap", and "I'm going to break off soon".Again, the Uni-Ball KuruToga Twist has a nifty mechanism that is 1st class. It's all plastic.
