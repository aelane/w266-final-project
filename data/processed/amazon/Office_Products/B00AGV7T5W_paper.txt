* Small paper capacity. The other, as silly as it is, when you tell it to print, and the paper tray is up... no more errors, "can't print", the door pops down automatically and away it prints! You could leave the paper tray alone and simply place your document of choice on the rear tray; legal, labels, 5x7 photo, 4x6 photo. )>Two separate paper trays, so you can keep one (top) filled with smaller photo-size paper while using the bottom for standard letter-size paper.>It was not noisy as some have noted. Photos printed on Canon photo paper (matte and glossy) turn out beautifully. The paper was too long & I couldn't understand why no one else complained about this. Be sure to use specially designed paper (for example, enter "canon paper_guide" in a search engine) to really see the difference of the higher resolution. The paper tray, the paper output tray, the scanner lid - it just all feels too cheap. Photos (on premium paper) are just ok - despite all the new technology touted in their ink, things just don't pop as nicely as on an OfficeJet Pro or Epson Artisan.So, as much as I love the print quality from Canon printers, this one is not a winner in my books. I believe it chooses the paper based on the size of the image, which I get, but at the same time that limits flexibility in printing. Use photo paper and settings and get the full quality the MG5420 is capable of producing; I think it's pretty remarkable. * The Print Dialog on the Mac lets you choose paper type and tray (there are two)  automatically or manually, but manual selection doesn't always obey. Multiple paper sizes can be filled and ready simultaneously.- Intuitive design - you have a full color, high resolution screen that actually visualizes each step you need to take.- Easy setup (see above).Cons:- Only real con for me is size/shape.
