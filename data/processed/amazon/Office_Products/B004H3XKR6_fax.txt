I'm not much of a fax user, but I tried it out just for this review. The fax works great but we don't use it that often. If it wasn't for the fax not functioning as a modem to receive incoming faxes into the PC instead of having to print them, I would say jump on this one right away. I did not use it as a fax yet, but plan to try. I also didn't bother to set up the fax because documents are so easily scanned and emailed and I don't know anyone who prefers to receive faxes instead of emailed attachments.The Epson WorkForce 840 is large: approximately 17.5 " wide, almost 15" deep without the screen or paper catcher extended, and about 11.75" tall. I will not speak to the fax part, because it is not even hooked up to a phone line.One word of caution right off the bat. (no fax).NEW MODEL AVAILABLE:  The new model of this printer, with more features and at a lower cost, is now available. We haven't used the fax feature yet but I'm sure glad that it's there for when I need it. I've only used the fax feature a couple of times and it faxed just fine.There are a couple of things worth mentioning, not really problems for me, but could use improvement. We haven't used the fax feature and don't plan to as we don't have a land line.The touch screen monitor on the printer is very advanced and easy to use and helps with the original setup and with changing settings at any point.

Neither does the fax.

The fax component needs to be set up separately with the printer "pretending" to be a separate machine -- make sure you follow the set-up wizard to the end if you want to use this feature.The printer can be connected directly to your computer via printer-to-USB or ethernet cable (neither included), and it has accessible ports in the front for a flash drive and memory cards (SD, XD, MS Pro, CF.)

A fax was sent but apparently never received.
