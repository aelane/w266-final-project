The box is sturdy. But, at $7.50, you're paying about $5 more per box than what you'd get at Office Depot or Staples. When I first got this box, it was a dream come true for my filing cabinet! This little box makes organizing papers and workbooks by seasons, subjects, and grades a breeze! The box that this was shipped in was sturdier than this file box! And you can also buy a box for your box, the "File Box Wrap" for $7.49. So, for a box and a "box wrap", that would cost over 17 dollars!And if you fill it with, say, 1 package of MO file folders for $7.99 (Now that's only 9 folders). I really like this box. This Smead MO File box is correctly sized to hold files, but it is just made of a very lightweight cardboard and is much too weak to be practical for transporting my important documents. The box for holding the files is ok. The box is just one part of the system and you have to order the other folders to make it work. It's a nice solid box that is more durable than a file folder or expandable file. Or as I used it, as a nice little box for both small items that you don't want to lose and for papers. Cover/file box wrap sold separately for $7.49.Final advice:Don't waste your hard earned money on this file box. If you fill this box up with papers and carry it around with the "handle" then you risk tearing it and losing all your papers when it falls to the ground.And the price? I really wanted this to help get organized but it's basically just a box even my daughter was like mom it's a box. The box works well organizing all kinds of stray memos and even letters of lesser importance. It's not a big box so it won't store a lot and it's made of cardboard so I think it's better left inside a drawer or shelf instead of being toted around. This box is part of Smead's MO ("My Organizer") trio of products that also includesfile foldersand aslipcase-- papers go into the file folders, the folders go into this box (which functions as a sort of portable, mini file-cabinet "for the desktop, drawer or shelf"), and this box goes into the slipcase (which to me seems unnecessary).This box is extremely basic in material (medium-weight cardboard) and color (solid dark blue outside, unfinished white inside). The box is packaged flat, with the "Autobottom" feature whereby when you remove it from the plastic overwrap and shape it from a flat- to a 3D-box, the bottom panels automatically slide together to form a solid bottom. So I have a box that keeps threatening to collapse and stands wobbly on my desktop.I won't be using this product. The box is fairly sturdy, but I can't get the bottom to close up right. That may be true, but the box doesn't seem sturdy enough to carry by the handles if you did. This is advertised as a box and it is a box so I suppose that's a good thing. So what is one to do with a badly made, ugly, box? I had envisioned a sturdier box that would be portable and good for carrying the homeschool files I need from room to room. It's just a box. Examining the box, it is made of a thin coated cardboard that seemed reasonably durable at first, but it is not the really thick sturdy cardboard that used to be used for making these boxes.I quickly put the box in my drawer and started keeping papers in it. As I tried to pickup the box full of paper, one side crumpled and bent. This box can be used as is or inserted into an outer box that Smead calls a Case Wrap.The box comes flat wrapped in cellophane and opens up to what you see above. I imagine this box isn't completely useless if you have no other choice, but I personally don't use it because it's flimsy. I was hoping for a box to replace a cardboard file box I've used for 8-9 years that's falling apart. This nifty box set up in less than a blink of an eye. Its simply too much for a single box. The Smead MO File box can help contain paper clutter. There is also a box wrap,Smead MO File Box Wrap , Letter Size, 3 inch Expansion, Navy (92030), which encases the whole system. The box is made of durable card stock, it seems like it will last a long time. I was looking forward to use this box to organize current "work in process" files. The box is so thin that while removing it from the shrink wrap I accidently folded the entire thing in half, leaving a crease down the front. I was looking for a decent box that could hold my son's school papers and when I saw this item offered I snagged it without too much consideration. After holding this box in my hands and putting it to use, I would honestly say that the retail price should be closer to a third or half of what they are asking for it. I expected a sturdy little box and all it is really is colored cardboard. I slipped the box into the front of my file drawer and now I have a quick and easy spot to toss receipts without worrying they'll fall out the side of a file folder. I am not sure if it trys to be a protective box for storage (thus explains its stiffness) or a convenient carrier so the handles may be gathered for such purpose. The box is not very well built, it is thin and not strong enough.The only use which I could think of is to use it as a mail inbox where I drop any new mails into this box before I read and process them !T
