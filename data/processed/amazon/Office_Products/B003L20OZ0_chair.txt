Excellent chair for a draftsman, or for a workbench in a shop. I must admit that I had a chair cushion left over from another chair which makes it feel incredibly good. The chair itself is relatively comfortable for this type of chair, but I strongly urge you to get that specific cushion mentioned above because once you try the chair with that cushion on it, you won't be happy with just the chair anymore.I noticed that when I pulled the handle out on the side it enabled me to lean back a lot in the backrest only. This chair is functional, versatile and comfortable. This specific chair is only useful if you have a surface that is higher than normal table or desk height.I like the mesh backrest because it's less likely to become hot when seated for a long time.Without the loop armrests, you can easily slide a dining chair slipcover over this if you have pets that shed and keep the seat from collecting pet hair.We think it does a great job of providing seating for higher than normal height situations. Easy!BUILD QUALITYWhile the Vue is not the fanciest chair, it has that industrial feel of office furniture that will last forever. This chair's ring is a standard diameter, which means that the heels rest a bit behind the knees. This chair is comfortable, durable, and not bad looking. It is quite heavy -- much heavier than my other Safco drafting chair, but rolls easily on its closed casters. Overall I like this workbench chair. Even though this chair is intended for workspaces that are higher than a standard desk, I can fit my legs under a desk height table while sitting in this chair. I find the chair comfortable, easy to move around and easy to raise and lower. Once put together the chair has wheels so it can be rolled easily. If you are planning on moving the chair to another floor it may be easier to bring the chair in pieces to the room and put the chair together on that floor. I put the chair together on one floor and then carried it up a flight of stairs which was a bit hard on me. I am really enjoying the chair so far. It was easy to put together and the assembled chair is very sturdy and for me, quite comfortable. It is not an easy chair or the type of chair one might use at the computer all day. Still, I can raise the chair up so high that my feet don't touch the floor and I need to use the adjustable foot ring. This is not a chair that is meant for all day use but rather for time-limited tasks, such as sitting at a drafting or craft table. I hope that this chair holds up several years because I really like it.
