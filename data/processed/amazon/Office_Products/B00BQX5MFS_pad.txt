The pad does not slide around my desk even though the bottom of the pad is smooth. The pad is smooth, doesn't attract dirt. I have worked with this pad both at work and at home and it has proved satisfactory for both work-related word processing and e-mail manipulation as well as home-based drawing programs and web surfing.The mouse pad surface itself is very smooth. The removable pad has a slick surface that can be easily wiped off. The pad really is comfortable with just the right amount of cushion in the middle. The pad is not fancy or colorful, but it is very professional for use in an office. As I started to use the pad I noticed: (1) I needed to make a slight adjustment to my positioning since I was not used to having a stopper [the wrist rocker] at the end of my mouse pad; and (2) the pad is NOT best suited for use with a wired mouse. I believe the pad will continue to look great with very little effort. It would probably have been cheaper to create a smooth pad that doesn't make such annoying noise.I so much wanted to like this mousepad and rate it highly but because the scraping is annoying, the most I can rate it is three stars. The pad itself is just a thin plastic sheet with the more advanced wrist support stuck on the back.

The I-Spire Series Wrist Rocker is a handsome, lightweight, well designed `mouse pad' variation.

In general, this pad and wrist rest work and feel better than almost everything I have tried, with the exception of the "Fellowes PlushTouch Mouse Pad/Wrist Rest with FoamFusion"I bought my second "Fellowes PlushTouch Mouse Pad/Wrist Rest with FoamFusion ".

The Wrist Rocker pad is a bit scratchy sounding when I move my mouse over it.However, the Wrist Rocker seems to be a clear winner when it comes to mouse responsiveness.
