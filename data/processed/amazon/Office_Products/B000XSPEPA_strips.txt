The strips come out when pulled and a new strip is ready to be pulled as soon as its predecessor is removed. The 75 one-inch strips disappear pretty quickly, much faster than a regular roll of tape. The strips of tape which are dispensed are generous in size, in fact a bit more generous than I am used to using. The strips are more expensive than regular tape rolls, but not by so much that they are unaffordable. Once you get the pre-cut strips of scotch tape into the dispenser, and put it on your wrist, it is really convenient.There are a few minor negatives. Positioning the strips correctly, making sure you hold on to the protruding tab, and sliding the less than smooth plastic parts together.However, once you go through these steps, you have a very useful product that makes wrapping or packaging much easier. No more sticking strips on the edge of the table before you go. Instead of cutting off little strips of tape and plastering them i=on the edge of a table, this puts them right where you need them without getting stuck on the package etc. Also, using these pre-cut strips assume that you will only need that length, a one-size-all approach that did not meet my amateur gift-wrapping needs. And the SCOTCH POPUP TAPE HANDBAND DISPENSER dispenses equal, pre-cut, appropriately sized strips of tape, reducing waste and producing a package that looks quite professionally wrapped.The simplicity of the idea for the SCOTCH POPUP TAPE HANDBAND DISPENSER makes you wonder why no one thought of this before. I've been using these strips for a couple of Christmas wrapping sessions and I love them to death.Highly recommended. You take out the little pre-measured strips and tape away! Cut off several strips at a time using the traditional cheap plastic dispenser, hanging them over a desktop or other ledge until ready for use.Clearly I had been deprived, neglected by the adhesive strip industry until now!There are only a few real advantages to owning this device. The strips seemed slightly longer than what I would ideally want. The strips are also pre-cut and come out of the dispenser with a simple touch. It makes wrapping much easier plus it allows you to use evenly cut strips...no more wasted tape or miscut ends. It is fantastic, but a few more strips would make it more practical.Overall, I highly recommend this product to anyone who has ever wished they had more hands while wrapping gifts. Once it's started, you just pull little the little strips off one after the other, sort of like post it notes. Although the strips of tape are pre-cut, they are lengthy enough for nearly any wrapping purpose. 75 strips do not go far when wrapping Christmas gifts!
