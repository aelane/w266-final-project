However, Windows seemed to only be able to locate the scanner drivers for whatever reason (even though it clearly acknowledged that the unit was an all-in-one). And the scanner integrates really well with the built in scanning software in Windows 7.tl;dr: Has worked wonderfully since the initial setup. It also is a quick and easy scanner when needed in a pinch. With the scanner on top and printer in the middle, it's also the perfect size for my desk, very low-profile.I have had two issues. Highly enlarged, it was clear the scanner wasn't perfectly focused, showed some blue color fringing, and contrast was not accurate. The scanner cover/lid has a expandable hinge so that you can place a book or larger object on the scanner without worrying if it will fit under the cover. The included scanner software is pretty basic, so as long as you don't go in thinking you'll be able to scan negatives, etc or do anything outside SOHO activities, you'll be fine.I'm really impressed with Epson's InkJet line. I've never had a scanner before, but was able to jump right into scanning photos and sending them to the desktop, or via wifi to the laptop.The ink cartridges that come with the printer are robust as well.

The scanner lid and the paper tray holder both seem more flimsy than my HP.

This Epson scanner yielded low contrast and washed out color scans compared to the Canon scanner.

The scanner is not fast, especially at high resolution.
