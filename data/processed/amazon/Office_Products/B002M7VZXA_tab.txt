If you reposition the tab, it's my experience that the ink is not lifted with the glue and no sticky residue remains on the page at all.6. But when I screwed up and needed to move a tab it came away cleanly and had all its stickiness left to be reattached! Having it listed under the Cornbread tab, has made it easy to find regardless. If you need a removable, re-positionable tab, this would be a nice product. I am using a tab on each of my WD Passport backup drives to write the date of the last backup and contents. The tab holds its shape and is far superior to any post it or flag. Write on the tab or highlight text beneath it and you'll be able to see through it; place it anywhere on your page, even reposition without causing rips, peels.
