This does not bother me as this is a photo printer, not a document printer. This really is a dedicated photo printer.About that expensive ink. As the first photo printer and that too a professional level, I had very high expectations from this product. For large photo prints, I much prefer the Canon over any other printer. The photo viewer is annoying to me so I'll have to disable that. It's not fast but for a 13x19 photo it only took a few minutes. I have owned many decent photo printers but sent my important images out to a lab for professional quality prints. I do all my photo printing from Lightroom and find that if I tweak the brightness and contrast to about 40 in the Lightroom Print module, everything is pretty much in sync.

The Pro-10 is also the second best photo inkjet printer in Canon's new lineup, behind the PIXMA Pro-1.Like all my other Canon printers (I own four now), setup is absolute simplicity.

If you're a professional, looking for photo longevity and durability with a truly 'professional' look, or just looking for that extra 'wow-factor', then I'd recommend the Canon PIXMA Pro-10.

I'd love to see a Pro photo printer have somewhat more user-friendly qualities in terms of both interface and software.
