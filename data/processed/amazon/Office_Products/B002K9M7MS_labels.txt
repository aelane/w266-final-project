I tried these new 3M labels in two sizes, the smaller letter size and this package shipping size. These labels are designed for laser printer use. With 250 labels per package, that will take care of a lot of mailing!These labels are also useful if you want a large and permanent label on storage boxes, file folders, and 101 other uses, like a name badge when you go to a function where there are tons of people, and you don't know a soul.3M makes thousands of products, from abrasives and adhesives to the Z100 Restorative, which your dentist will use to make you look like you have a beautiful new tooth, with aesthetically matched color. These labels are fully compatible with the Avery 5163 template, though you can download a template for them if you somehow don't have the Avery templates. Otherwise, these are perfectly functional labels that should perform well in most labeling situations. These labels are easy to use. These labels work nice and stick well. Two hundred and fifty labels which can be addressed with inkjet and laser printers.They have a matte finish are a good size of 2"x4".The adhesive is strong. I don't like to use printed labels, since I prefer hand addressing greeting cards. These labels are large enough to cut into shapes (Xmas trees, ornamental balls, etc.) These labels provide a good amount of space to write out the address. They're even smart enough to make their labels compatible with the Avery label software so many already use. They match up with Avery 5163 labels, so getting your program to work with them should be fine.I have tested them with an HP LaserJet 4+ printer, which was perfect. Even though these are "laser labels," I tested printing from an HP OfficeJet Pro K5400 and it also looked great -- very crisp and sharp, even at size 6 font. What I found unimpressive, however, is that the labels are rather thin. I've used other labels which are thicker/more opaque and do a better job at this. Excellent labels that do just what they are supposed to do. Only being familiar with Avery labels, I was pleased with this 3M product. Tried these labels at home on my 4-in-1 HP printer (ink jet) and in the office on a Brother color Laser printer and on a Konica-Minolta BizHub 451 (also Laser printer) and the labels printed out fine. The labels are easy to peel from the backing sheet. I don't use mailing labels as much as in the past, but there are times when I still need to run a batch of labels. These labels have all of the information you need printed on the perimeter of each label page. These labels are compatible with the Avery 5163 labels, and you get 10 (2 columns of 5) labels per sheet. These labels do stay adhered to a cardboard box, which is pretty good, because usually they seem to peel up a little for no good reason. The labels print nicely without jams, and are easily removed from the page, adhere nicely to the envelope. These labels meet all requirements and surpass other brands like Avery and generics. These 3M labels are great! The labels are easy to remove from the page because the border edges are already removed from the wax paper. I would definitely recommend these labels for home or office use. I was pleased with these shipping labels. What can I say about labels? These 3M labels seem pretty durable and strongly adhesive -- I also like the margins between each label, which make them easier to peel apart and less likely to get stuck together as the sheets are stored for long periods of time. They are very useful for printing out those shipping labels for your customers or sending out those gifts to your family. The labels are very sticky and work well with my Brother laser printer. These labels are great. These are very good labels and do what they're supposed to do. The labels are substantial, more so than most, which means that they will not jam your printer, or melt down if you want to add design or color; something which requires more ink. Personally, I don't think mailing labels is something you should skimp on. These 3M labels offer terrific performance and are completely trustworthy, which is very important for labels. These labels are ideal for shipping with a large 2 x 4 inch size. These are self stick labels you can easily write on with either pen or pencil. They're mailing labels by 3M... what can I say? Usually I use the Avery Brand of shipping labels, and when these came I was so excited to see that they have printed the compatible Avery label number right on each sheet. These particular labels correspond to Avery 5163. What can you say about these 3M labels? Setting up to print on the labels is easy. The labels won't fall off in shipping. What can you say about shipping labels? I really like these new 3M labels. I've used Avery labels and now 3M is in the game. These labels do what they have to: they adhere well once removed from the page, which means they also adhere well to the sheet until removed and don't get stuck in the printer, yet have a feature which makes them easy to peel off, which can help preserve your fingernails and sanity when you're addressing many, many labels in a short period.What distinguishes these 3M labels from the others out there is the detailed instruction sheet on how to use them, with precise directions on how to find the needed template, from the 3M website or in Word. The labels are also compatible with the Avery template, if you're switching brands after using that other brand first. These labels work well and are inexpensive. I had never used 3M labels before, even though my BIL works for 3M. Nope, labels came through with no jams! The labels took the ink well.The weight of the labels (if you can "weigh" labels) have a solid feel, a nice heft. The labels peel off easily and stay where you apply them. These labels are of very high quality. The labels are billed as permanent, and they are, but happily they do not have a killer grip on your package the instant the two meet. I used these labels in my HP inkjet printer without any problems. The labels are white with slightly rounded corners. I stick these labels directly on top of old labels and write the new address on them. Bad labels can wreck your whole day when you're running a batch of shipments.Because these are inexpensive, I also use them for quick labeling jobs around the house:  storage bins, file drawers, anything I don't have to worry too much about getting adhesive on. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with my old inferior labels...maybe use them as light post-it notes. These labels are no exception.Recently, Avery has released labels in which the paper is perforated to easily fold back, exposing the ends of the sticky labels. 3M labels have a borderless side that makes the label edge visible, however the lack of perforations makes removing a 3M label as difficult as traditional stamped label types. These labels were easy to find a setting to use in Word to print them, but the labels themselves were out of alignment with that setting. To be fair, there were 80 labels per sheet and were easy to lift from the sheets, but I wasn't happy with wasted labels after printing. Now I use these labels, print the addresses on them with my computer printer, and my applications look so much more professional. (but seriously: they're labels. I have to admit that until I saw these, it hadn't occurred to me that I didn't HAVE to use hand-written labels when I mailed personal packages. I have MS Word, and sure enough, though I'd never printed labels before, have just what I need already (the Avery 5163 template). When I need labels again, I'll buy these. These labels do not smear nor are they easily pulled off. There are 10 labels per sheet and easily slide into any printer. These labels are the perfect size and slid through the printer with no problems whatsoever. I don't want my labels peeling up on the corners.These labels performed exceptionally well on both fronts. These 2'x4' labels are perfect for that - large enough for both addresses and compact enough to fit on nearly any package. These are permanent labels, however, and I know from experience that this type of label will stick well but prove difficult to remove from some surfaces.I'm happy to recommend a product like this from 3M that works the way it should, looks good, and is reasonably priced (the package comes with 25 sheets/250 labels). These labels are great, and the adhesive is excellent, especially on non-porous surfaces or carton. The labels can be handwritten on, or they can be laserprinted. The labels also allowed writing from a Sharpie permanent market to bleed through, although this should probably not be an issue... just an observation.Well, what more can I say? They are labels that can be used in either an ink-jet or laser printer. The labels are nice and thick and they take ink and toner very well. These are larger than most, good for Address labels for packages or title plates for folders and reports.As with all 3M labels, you can go to their website and download templates for your word processor that go with these labels.I play Role Playing Games and have a bunch of file folders full of e-books I printed out. These labels were the perfect size for getting them in order. You would think labels are labels.... well, coffee is coffee too. If you're using UPS or USPS online generated labels, you probably realize these won't be big enough. These permaneht adhesive labels can be used for a variety of uses. I highly recomend these labels. These are cheaper than Avery labels, but do just as well. If you need some labels and want to save some money, these provide good bang for the buck. Overall these labels are very well made. Printed a few labels last night on our Canon color inkjet to put on holiday packages and they printed beautifully and stuck to the packages like, well, glue! The labels are simple, convenient, and very printer friendly (the labels worked well with our inkjet). I am also using these labels for labeling my son's preschool folders, and for this purpose, labeling something other than for addresses, works great! I recommend these labels to offices of all disciplines as well simply because they are good for labeling files and such. I was looking for shipping labels this size, with a good adhesive, no tendency to wrinkle, and a surface you can print, type, or write on with pen or pencil. These labels are exactly what they say they are. I love these labels.
