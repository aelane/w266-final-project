It's basically the same printer with a few improvements; the most welcoming is the wireless interface. The printer however had a problem. I've had the Brother HL-5240 printer for several years and have always been very happy with it. I had to replace my old All-in-one printer. At only $150 I paid it is a very solid printer The printer's footprint is concise and it isn't terribly noisy. This printer has some great features but there are two serious issues:1) POWER DRAIN. This printer causes brown-outs in my house. It's enough to make this printer useless for printing anything serious. I got it going but it wasn't nearly as painless as my Lexmark.Judging from all of the printer reviews I have read on Amazon, there is no perfect printer. This printer has a LOT of good features so it's a toss up.I will probably be returning this printer. This printer is no exception. All real printer management is done from the network I/F. After setting the printer up and getting it running, do this again, and then keep these pages. I bought this printer about six months ago because both my wife and daughter have laptops. Since I also have this printer hard-wired to my desktop, my two darling girls can be in other rooms (there's the reason for one "Thank God") while completing their work without interrupting me while I'm doing mine.I have replaced the toner once by ordering the LD large capacity toner tray through Amazon. The printer has continued to - just work.

It's much less cumbersome.The printer is quite noisy.

You just select "Duplex" or "Booklet", and the printer does the rest.

Also from the manual, is the following: "...Although the printer can be used in both, wired & wireless network, only ONE of the connections methods can be used at a time..." So keep that in mind if you want to use both.I would suggest the following improvements, if Brother is interested to listen:- Make it quieter;- Add a little high-quality display instead of all the lamps (also miss from my HP - all cheap inkjet have'em today!
