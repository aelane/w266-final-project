The built-in software was more than adequate for my needs.Preparing to print a label...I found the built-in software to be quite intuitive. Easy to use "lite" software version is onboard the unit itself and shows up on screen ready to use. You do not need to install any software. The software that is hard-wired into the labeler provides:Multiple fontsSingle or multi-line labels - including a mixture, by using text boxesGraphics - including symbol fonts, pictures from your hard drive, or screen captureBordersNumbering (so you can print "Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3" in a single step)MarginsEtcThere is additional software that can be installed if you need to print barcodes or from a database (like a mail merge). I don't anticipate doing those, so I'll likely never install the software. The hard-wired software is plenty sophisticated for my needs.I was pleased to discover the wide range of tapes available for this unit. There's no software needed in addition to that inside the printer, but the optional software really makes making professional, legible labels pretty simple.The quality of the labels is very good. While the basic software was sufficient for my use, the P-Touch editor software was fun to make really creative labels and even upload small pictures that I used on some. I did install the full software and it would only work intermittently. I don't really like the P-touch Editor software, but the included MS Word add-on makes it a little better. It has its own software installed so you need not install anything. No software installation just a few simple steps and away I went.My needs are fairly basic so I am completely satisfied with the "Editor Lite" configuration which is already set up and ready to use. The P-Touch Lite software is actually stored on the label maker itself and launches if the control button on the side of the unit is set to "EL." The software is easy to set to print a label, and the labels print very well, even automatically cutting the labels for you.Peeling the backing off the labels is easy. I did not bother to use whatever extra software might be on the CD. You do not need to load the added software unless you are looking for some advanced features. I liked using the Word software a little better but maybe that's just because I'm more familiar with it.You can purchase additional tapes in varying colors, widths, acid free, extra strength, extra narrow (for labeling the edges of cd cases), fabric tapes, etc... I did not install the optional software. The software for the advanced mode really allows you to do a lot -- and I haven't explored all the options since I don't have use for them, but it would allow a lot of flexibility, especially for the small business owner, for whom this product seems ideal. Since it comes with built-in software (you literally plug it in and the software runs on your Windows XP or Vista system without having to install anything) you can move it around and share it with colleagues without a problem. After installing the P-Touch software, you have to flip a little switch on the label maker so that it will use that particular software.The software itself is great. I did not need to install the software and within a few minutes I had an address label made with a photo on it. I also chose to install the P-touch Editor software from the enclosed CD instead of letting it default to the P-touch Editor Lite software that automatically launches when you connect the unit. Using either the built-in "Lite" software, or the full-fledged software you can optionally install from CD, you can use any TrueType font, as well as graphics. If you use the Lite software on the unit itself, you set a switch on the rear of the printer to "EL" ("Editor Lite"), and, when attached to your PC via the included USB cable, a new drive mounts on your computer - just like if you had inserted one of those USB flash drives. The Lite software is on this drive & is run from it directly, with no need to install additional drivers.
