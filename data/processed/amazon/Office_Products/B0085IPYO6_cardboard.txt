It's a cardboard bos for holding documents. I think that it's seriously overpriced for a cardboard box. It is made of cardboard which makes it light (although obviously not durable to stand the test of time), and it holds your average folders. $9.99 for a simple cardboard box is INSANE!I have no complaints about the box itself. $9.99 for a cardboard box? Sturdy cardboard, but not exactly easy to carry. The cardboard is rather thin and it takes a little bit of work to make the bottom flat. It is a cardboard box. An expensive cardboard box. This is just a cardboard box for holding letter size documents or possible magazines. This is simply a thin corrugated cardboard box with a thin waxy/plastic coating and a handle built into the flap.It is perfectly sized:  regular folders and hanging folders fit inside (hanging folders do hang), and the box itself fits between the rails in my standard size filing cabinet. However it is just a basic coated cardboard. I'd never pay that much for a glorified cardboard box. It is simply a cardboard box - and there is only one in the package.Save your money, and find something which will hold more than this. The cardboard seems sturdy enough, but I don't think it would hold up to long term and frequent use.

But it's just cardboard.

If only they made it in a coated cardboard or a recycled opaque plastic.As with the other SMEAD products, it all depends on what your use is for these things.

To begin with, the cardboard is very flimsy, I would say that it is twice as thick as a cereal box (at best).
