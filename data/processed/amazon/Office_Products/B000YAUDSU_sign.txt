This sign is a much nicer quality than I expected. In comes the sign. I think the sign might fade if in direct sunlight, but ours is shaded under a portico. Though the sign's plastic, it looks like a more expensive metal sign.Very happy with this solution, though my hubby might have to find a new outlet for his own special brand of confrontational humor. "But dear, why in the WORLD would I need a 'no soliciting' sign?" I like that this sign comes with double sided tape to hold it up. This is a sturdy sign and can be read from quite aways away. My last no soliciting sign was stolen off my front door, no doubt by a &#34;solicitor&#34;. The sign can be clearly read from the sidewalk, even with a screen door in front it. The sign is like the FBI though in that it doesn't really let you know all the times it successfully prevented something unpleasant :) This is a really nice, yet simple, sign. Just having the sign on the door or at your place of business will not guarantee that you won't continue to be harassed by solicitors.

This "No Soliciting" sign is very noticeable from a good distance away, which is useful since we have a fairly long walkway and don't want to overly inconvenience the solicitors by having them walk all the way up to our porch just to be turned away.

I purchased this No Soliciting sign after getting one too many magazine sales people at my front door.

I'm not sure if my sign was some sort of lemon or if they simply can't withstand direct sun but regardless this product did not meet my needs.I will be returning it immediately, but I would still recommend it for applications where it wasn't going to be in direct sun because it looks decent.
