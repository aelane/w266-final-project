This Post-it Full Adhesive Roll is basically paper tape with the same removable adhesive that makes Post-it notes famous. It uses the famous Post-it adhesive paper (I chose green) that comes in a dispenser. The paper rolls and cuts easy. They either start to peel from whatever you stick them to or tear the paper when removing it or leave pieces on pottery, glasses, etc. I use this adhesive paper tape for all kinds of things. Problem is I'm labeling paper, when I could just use a marker to write on it anyway.More of a colorful gimmick, than a useful product. The paper takes all kinds of inks well and the adhesive is never gummy.I love that I can cut off at what ever length I need but as it is a good 1 inch across there is plenty of room to pencil in the info. The paper tears very evenly too and the edge that tears the paper off isn't sharp. The paper sticks nicely to the container and then peels off easily later. The paper roll is 1 inch x 400 inches which is 11 yards and is a full adhesive that sticks securely and removes cleanly. The bright green paper is noticable, and sticks securely to the plastic lids of our refrigerator dishes. The paper also comes off clean when it is no longer needed. I tested it on paper, glass, wood, fabrics, and metal, and found that it sticks to almost any surface with some degree of stickiness.Currently, this roll is available in white, green and yellow and 1-inch width. The paper is a little thicker than a pad of Post-It's would be, nicely so.LikePost-it Flags, 1/2 inch Assorted Primary Colors, Four Dispensers of 35 Flagsit can be used to highlight passages in books or printout. The paper is thick enough to cover up what was previously written on the folder tabs with a felt-tip pen. It doesn't stick everywhere, but on standard paper and smooth surfaces it should work just fine.One note - unless you're really stuck on the green, check some other Post-It colors such asPost-it Full Adhesive Roll 1 x 400 (Pink)andPost-it Full Adhesive Roll, 1 x 400 Inches (Yellow), as these may be priced lower (they were both about $2 less on the day I wrote this review). I also like that the paper is fairly heavy and opaque. You do need to be careful when pulling it off paper, especially fine paper, although it makes due for short little bookmarks.The tape does not always tear away cleanly, but like most tape, you'd have to expect that. If using on paper, I would test the surface first as ink can come off. The paper is nice and thick enough and the color is bright and noticeable. I've also found the adhesive to pull up some of what it is attached to, i.e., the paper underneath.
