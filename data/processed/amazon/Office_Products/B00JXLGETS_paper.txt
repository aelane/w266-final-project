I also like the rear paper feeder for keeping some photo quality paper handy. Even though I have not had any paper jams, any good printer should have a rear access just in case.Ok, as I mentioned in the beginning, the cons are really insignificant, but my mention of them may be helpful to some.First of all, setup took longer than I am accustomed to; about 20 minutes to download and install everything. So I did, then chose rear paper feed as the source. But they hold so dang much paper, I won't have to deal with that very often.My only concern is the cost of the ink cartridges. Love that it has 3 paper trays being able to use an entire ream. Large paper capacity at 580 pages means we refill less than once a week. I've been very irritated by how often the paper jams, but I think maybe I had the paper trays swapped (#1 in the #2 slot, etc. I put new paper in the compartments, apparently well under the full capacity of the trays, and it just keeps jamming. I double-checked, and the paper size is correctly set up for both trays. I did managed to get it to start working properly by removing both paper trays, clearing everything out, turning off the machine, and putting in the paper trays again. The mammoth paper trays can hold up to a full ream of paper put together.Similarly, the ink cartridges are jumbo-sized, so they will have to be replaced less often. Or white & color paper. It&#8217;s important to use high-quality/glossy paper if you want to print in high-quality color, and in fact the printer won&#8217;t even let you print on cheap paper if you say you want a color photocopy. You either have to actually insert glossy paper or just tell the printer you put glossy paper in it and let it print on regular paper. The paper capacity is 250 pages greater on the WF-4640.

apporximately 1.5ft W x 2ft D x 2ft H; The second paper tray is added by simply placing it under the printer - You can get the printer w/o that paper tray (WF-4630 model) and shave several inches off the height and also save a good chunk of $$$ .The printer came very nicely packed and there were lots of tapes to remove.

I had run out of my premium photo paper, but still had some Epson Presentation Paper.

With it set up and the paper trays extended (output tray and rear feed), the printer measures 18&#34; wide x 18 1/2 &#34; tall, x 25 1/2&#34; deep.
