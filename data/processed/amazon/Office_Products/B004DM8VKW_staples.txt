Frustrated, I removed the staples, closed the loading bar, and brought it to my husband to see if he could figure it out.He did the same thing that I did, trying to pull it apart like a conventional stapler. I handed him the staples and told him to try loading them. It's okay if you're only doing a few staples, but if you will be doing a big project requiring you to staple over and over again, I'd get something else. 4 staples. Loading the staples is not an easy task but once it is loaded, stapling up to 25 sheets of paper is a charm. They are just supposed to be available when you want them, not break, and put staples through papers. You just insert the staples in lovingly and push back. Loading staples is not (at least for me) intuitive on this stapler. To load staples, you first push down on the end part of the stapler which releases the staple tray at the front of the stapler. I've found adding staples using SmartTouch's quick-load button is far easier than fiddling around with spring-loaded models.Usually I have to repeatedly restaple or remove incomplete staples from larger-paged projects because inferior staplers can't handle that many pages or they jam up. Loading staples was easy and I immediately pushed it through 25 pages with little effort. Plus the staples were a little awkward to drop in. Cheap staples will buckle and jam the stapler so buy the premium ones.
