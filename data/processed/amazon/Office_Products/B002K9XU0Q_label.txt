If they are not easy to remove, the label can be easily torn. I also have a Brother label printer that uses a roll of file folder labels, but those don't stay affixed to the folders well - and your computer has to be turned on when you need a label -- also, in some cases they don't come off easily either. I like a more substantial label with a slicker finish. You can just stick a new label over an old folder, and it's easy as that! I will not use any other label in the future. We use file label clear protection stickers, so the Post-it brand removeables are ideal for us. I tried to remove a previous label from one of my file folders and waddya know, I couldn't remove it cleanly and left a mess.My only complaint about these labels are their dimensions. I love that it is a label and not a note. I use Printshop (occasionally), Avery Dennison (mostly) & Microsoft Word (rarely) for label printing. Problem is that if I want to reuse it, the label rips the folder. Though I could easily place this label over the existing label, or on the ripped folder, I can get OCD at times. It is a nice label which you can stick it anywhere in toys, containers, cabinets, files or for your kitchen. So I would only buy them if you need a label that is reusable. (Having struggled with label alignments, I was pleased at how easy this was. The label comes right off without ruining the book paper or cover stock. When I put a label over an existing tab that has writing on it (I reuse folders a lot!) I re-stuck the same label 4 times and it still stuck really well. That's the label is thin and the previous marker writing will show thru and possibly make your label difficult to read. These aren't shiny like my other little label maker labels, but they will assuredly be easier to remove when it is time to wash the quinoa jar and having the option to replace the label on the sparkling clean jar is appealing.It is recommended that partially printed sheets not be fed through the printer and I haven't tested that warning. One then might ask if the label is so easy to remove, will it stay in place? Even so, each label is only 2 cents. Finally, here's a reusable label that actually sticks well until you want to remove it-- then it comes off cleanly.These are made of Post-It note material, but with a much stickier adhesive. However, I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to take the label on and off a file folder and a binder multiple times (more than ten) without any noticeable difference in quality. I have also resorted to scratching out an old label and scratching in a new one. Not one label wasted.Post-It is one of those brands which are always copied unsuccessfully by other companies, so much so that we call the knock-offs by their name. I haven't found any of them to be exceptionally sticky or more sticky than your average label. After really pressing and leaving the label on for a day, I noticed a little tearing of the paper underneath. They would be great anywhere you need to temporarily adhere a label (or message) to another piece of paper, plastic, laminated surface, metal, etc...  For instance, I intend to use these to put prices on the front end papers of books in my store. As of February 6, 2010 per label cost is 1.99 cent for Post-It, 1.83 cents for  Avery, and 1.73 cents for 3M. With these you can easily remove the label and fasten a new one with a different file name. Now I can just remove the label and put a new one on it. It is really great to be able to remove a label when you want to change the name or title and not have any residue left on the folder or the old name show through the new label on top of it because you could not remove the old label.These Post-it brand Super Sticky File Folder Labels can be written on in pen, pencil or ink, typed on or printed on by ink jet or laser printers using the Avery Template 5366. I tried out a label on a folder and left it there for a few months, had no trouble pulling it off and putting it on another folder. This is so easy, though, that even the label corner is not damaged; nor does it stick up when you re-adhere it to something else.CONS:--The paper surface of the labels is not very high quality:  there is slight edge bleeding on the characters.
