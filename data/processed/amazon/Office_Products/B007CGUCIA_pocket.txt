It has a large outside pocket and 4 inside pockets of various sizes to fit pens id etc.It also has a full zipper that goes all the way around the unit sealing all my goodies inside and making them weather protected.I am very pleased with the quality lightness and build of this product. It has a zippered pocket and a Velcro tab closure pocket inside the front cover which would be good pencils, erasers, tissue, calculator, and such. The pocket inside the back cover could hold non-punched papers. There's a perfect clipboard-sized pocket in the back.It's just the right size to hold enough notepaper for a few hundred hole-punched pages of your choice, but it also has a wonderful see-through mesh pocket inside that holds post-its, pens, colored pencils or whatever small, loose items you might want to keep safe inside.Another small pocket just above features a velcro closure for this space that looks perfect for holding a calculator, cell phone, iPod, or other slightly bulkier item.The three rings themselves can be removed via velcro strips, which could be useful if using this organizer as a book protector, in which case a paperback or hardcover book could be lusciously carried and cared for in style, surrounded by the black vinyl case that can be zipped snugly shut around it.There is a useful large pocket in the back (right) side of this organizer perfect for accommodating loose papers, or perhaps for placing a clipboard... in which case this becomes a snazzy zip-closure clipboard organizer. Lo and behold there was a pocket that easily held it. It seems relatively waterproof* Outside pocket is practically worthless except for small scraps of paper/pencils/pens . There is also small top pocket with a velcro flap closure, another large pocket to put more papers on the inside on the right, and a stretchable loop to hold even wide pens.The zippers themselves work well enough. There is also 1 pocket inside that just Velcros shut so note cards would probably be better for that.For this binder not even the kids were impressed.
