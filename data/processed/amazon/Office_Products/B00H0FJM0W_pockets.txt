I love to categorize and divide, and having the extra pockets is a huge help. The three pockets let us organize within one folder - without that we'd either use two folders or colored paper separators, which is easy to miss.I like the larger tab area, too. The extra pockets add a level of organization that make these my new favorite folder!Why, yes, I might be a bit of a dork about office supplies. First of all, they have pockets on both flaps to better hold your papers, plus a shallower pocket on the one side that would be good for holding electronic data copies on disk. The pockets are secure enough that you can even use them to hold cut projects rather than full sheets of papers. The two larger pockets are open on the inside which makes it easier to remove whatever you need to pull out. But the pockets and other features inside are amazing. Two ordinary folder pockets, one on each side, plus an enclosed pocket for smaller items. I love the 3 pockets and the &#34;lock it&#34; flaps inside of these so that i can organize within the folder and so that no papers can fall out! The extra high interior pockets safely hold documents. The three inner pockets basically make this folder do the work of four separate file folders. The inner pockets keep your documents more secure, especially if you are using the folders to hold documents outside of the file cabinet (on the go). The additional pockets and Lockit flaps in these Smead folders come at a cost, but it may be worth the extra to improve the functionality of the folders.
