I don't do a lot of package wrapping, but I ship a box or two every couple of weeks, and I'll occasionally help someone pack for a move, so this does come in handy. Because I do a lot of shipping, the one thing I didn't like was that it holds only a small roll of tape. If you do a lot of packing, you will go through the small rolls of tape quickly, so you will need to frequently reload with the smaller, more expensive, rolls of tape. I am going to need a lot of tape, and this roll isn't a standard size, meaning I'm stuck buying this particular Scotch brand. But if you plan to do a lot of packaging and have really large hands, I would look elsewhere. But if you ship a lot of stuff with Ebay or are packing a lot of boxes for a move or for storage, you would probably be better off with a commercial tape dispenser. If you have a lot to pack, you will have to replace the tape quite too often. I sell a lot on EBay and was looking for a nice, easy tape dispenser for packaging and shipping my items. If you need to package a lot of stuff at home, this is a great tape dispenser that is comfortable and easy to use, while also being simple to unload and load new tape. I do a lot of online shopping, and a lot of returns.

I purchase a lot of things through the mail and on occasion have to return them; the included 1.88 in x 600 in roll lasted me just short of a year.

There are a lot of reviews on here that go into great detail about all of the various features of this product, but this review is going to tell you what I liked and did not like about the product.I liked that the tape stayed in place and was protected from grime.I liked that the "gun" was compact in size and had a nice looking blue protective cover.I did not like the fact that the rolls were so small, even though I knew it was a compact dispenser.

I am probably like a lot of people.
