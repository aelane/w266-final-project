Also, the marker that came with it was already dry even though it was brand new. It's nice that it came with a marker and magnets...even if the marker I got was already dry. The marker that came with it is nearly impossible to see on this board but when I used it on a white board it was nice and clear. The included marker is nothing great, but nothing horrible either... we have a whole collection of mini dry erase markers & crayons so this just went into the pile, all seem to work fine on the board and erase easily (with a bit more effort required when writing over the scratch ours arrived with).If you can manage to get one without damage I think it's a nice option when you want a smaller board with a more modern feel. I used another marker pen (black) and I found the surface, being silver/gray, made the writing hard to read unless it was written in huge letters. The included marker (black) is ok, but you really need something with a thicker writing point. Include a better marker. The marker will die pretty quickly and the eraser isn't up to snuff. The included marker has a top with a miniature dry eraser to clean up your scribblings. The marker itself takes a second to write and while I'm not sure if that's due to the board surface or the marker itself, it still works fairly well. The original marker that came with mine didn't work well, but a replace worked fine on the finish. The marker comes off well - too well, in fact.
