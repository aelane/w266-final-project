The sheets print cleanly on my fussy old inkjet printer, and the borderless labels peel off the backing easily. There are 4 sheets of florescent pink, yellow, and lime green and 3 sheets of blue. You can run the sheets through your printers multiple times so there's no need to use up the entire run of 30 labels the first time through.The labels themselves stick, remove, and leave no nasty mess behind. It comes with 15 sheets total with 30 labels per sheet. 3 sheets of blue and 4 sheets of pink, yellow, and limeade. I prefer these sheets to the Avery sheets for this reason.The colors are bright, the adhesive is great, and it worked with my labels I had saved on the computer in an Avery format.There are 3 blue sheets (30 labels per sheet), and 4 sheets of the Pink, Yellow and neon Green. They peel off of the sheets like a breeze, stick on all kinds of materials, and pull off without leaving a trace. There are 3 sheets of the blue and four of each of the other three colors, pink, yellow and lime, the colors are in brightly visible neon shades. There are four sheets each of Pink, Yellow, and Limeade, but only three sheets of Blue. 3 by 10 label sheets are probably the most popular label sheets. The assorted color-coded sheets of blue, pink, yellow, and limeade are easy to print from an inkjet or laser printer without the tedious task of taking out a marker and separately handwriting each label.

There are four sheets of each color.

Having sheets of mixed label colors makes no sense, as we all tend to use some colors more than others, based upon their symbolic color meaning.These labels are compatible with the Avery 5160 template, but just as I found with other manufacturer products that claim to be compatible with Avery, these labels also seem to have extra left margin space.

There are four sheets (120) each of yellow, pink and limeade (color, not juice - bright-light green), and three sheets of blue (90).
