These clips are exactly what I was looking for. These well made clips will last a long time and are completely worth buying over and over again. These clips are made very sturdy and they should last me a long time. Binder clips are in style. These binder clips are the same ones you see in the office products stores except they are much less expensive and free shipping when you order enough on any one order. I use these clips for everything. These binder clips help me keep my page in my planner, keep chapter work together when I remove it from my binder (like after being tested), and to keep my page in my notebook. the clips are good on the fingers to press. Well, what can I say--they're binder clips. These clips are very sturdy. Not much to report about these binder clips except to say that they work, they haven't broken and I haven't come across any defective ones. These clips are made of good metal and can bind large stacks of paper. They are binder clips.
