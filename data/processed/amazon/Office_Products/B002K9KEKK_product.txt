The Post-It Color Coding Labels is another quality product of Post-It Notes. It is a very good product and does exactly what you would expect. Honestly I don't know if I will buy this product if it were not for the generosity of the Amazon Vine program. Sorry, Post-It, I can't recommend this product. Although this product advertises it as for usage with storage bins, it is made from the same technology and suffers the same flaw. I recommend this product for printer and/or manual use. This product is labeled as super sticky and they mean it. I have never been disappointed with a "Post-it" product.

I'm sold on this product.

The product is labeled as "Laser" but they worked fine in my inkjet printer.

I would give the product 5 out of 5 stars and would purchase when I run out!
