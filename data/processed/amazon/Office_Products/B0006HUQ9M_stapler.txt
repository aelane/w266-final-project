Great stapler. Not sure what else we look for in stapler, but the kind of solid, reliable staplers I like. This is not to say it is a bad stapler, it is just a plain lightweight stapler. I really wish this stapler was red - only because it would be perfect then. It functions exactly like a classic stapler. I only tried the stapler with S.F. This is a nice heavy stapler. I am very happy with this stapler, and should I need another it will be this particular brand and model. I've been pounding on this stapler 8-9 times a day for YEARS and it:-Still works perfectly-Still looks like newMaybe I've used it 20,000 times and it hasn't jammed (except once when I mistakenly tried to staple a magazine) plus it's nice and heavy at 18 ounces and stays put when I use it. I looked at the new stapler that I received from Amazon and it is identical, except for color, to the one I have been using all these years. So, if you need a stapler, this is the one you want. The stapler is heavy-duty without being overly heavy to hold. This is a good stapler for a desk that sees a lot of stapling work or as a teacher's stapler for her or his desk. This stapler is solidly built out of what looks to be cast aluminum. If you're looking for a solid stapler with good capacity and is easy to use than look no further. Swingline and stapler are forever linked in business supply.This company simply makes an excellent product that is the standard office stapler found on most desks.The design is simple and effective.We know how to work and load it from years of experience with it.I won&#8217;t say there is never a problem but this is a dependable proven product that meets our needs time after time. I have this and another Swingline stapler, theSwingline LightTouch Reduced Effort Stapler. You don't appreciate a good, basic stapler until you've had to deal with a cheaply-built, poorly-designed one. I've had my old cheap/plastic stapler for going on 15 years and have had serious frustrations with the fact that it won't staple together more than 15 pages. This stapler absolutely crushes the other brand we had been putting up with. It feels nearly indestructible.Buy it and don't worry about having a decent stapler for the rest of your life. put the stapler right side up, put whatever size stapes you are going to use in the track, and put the handle back in position.No staples come with the stapler.Amazon sells good quality staples of both types.Swingline is known for good quality staplers and staples. My last stapler had a loose spring that I had to constantly adjust or re-install to get it to work, so when I bought this one, it was a sure step up! This all metal stapler is obviously meant for heavy duty office use. I received this stapler through Amazon's Vine Program. It works perfectly, and I highly recommend it if you want a standard stapler. It's a little tricky to release this, but I figured out that you just need to press the stapler together, release the latch, and then open it up. I sure enjoyed this stapler over my old swingline it is nice to buy a replacement that works better than the one before. It's a heavy stapler made of metal with plastic trim (but not too much to make it disposable). This is a classic stapler by Swingline and works just like you'd expect, consistantly and well. The stapler did not jam with 6 sheets, this is what I staple most often, most times it the off brand staples that will jam your stapler, I would recommend this product  I suggest Swingline Staples too. This stapler gets heavy  use from a wide variety of users in the offices of the New York-New Jersey Trail Conference and it seems to hold up well.It can staple 24 pages of 18 pound bond with little trouble, and can go up to 30 pages with a double staple, one from the front and one almost on top on the bottom.It's lighter than the ones from ten years ago -- those were made in Mexico and this example was made in China. Most of us think a stapler is a stapler, but this is not true. The stapler works well, looks decent, and has the ability to staple through a pretty good size stack of papers. A stapler isn't a very exciting office product, though I'm sure they were very exciting when invented in the late 1800s. I've never been a stapler slapper - I'm gentle with all my tools - so I don't know how well it works if you slam your hand or fist on the top. If I am sitting down, I tend to prefer holding the stapler in the air when using it, and some staplers aren't strong enough to work properly like that, because they rely on downward force. When I whack on this stapler if often becomes jammed. I find that I have to be more gentle with it and slowly depressed the stapler's head in order to keep it from getting stuck. This stapler is the dependable sturdy no fuss stapler for teachers,home use etc. It has really been the classic stapler with sturdy construction and easy to load or use open or closed. The 747 is a classic Swingline stapler. This stapler claims to staple 20 sheets, and it does that cleanly.
