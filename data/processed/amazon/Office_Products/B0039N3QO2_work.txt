With some work, the tabs came off the slick poster paper & photo paper - just peel slowly.Overall, I'm very happy with these tabs. These work great. These Scotch Reusable tabs work just as advertised. Other than that these work great! These tabs work great to hold securely but not permanently. These work great! These work great for holding lightweight things like postcards and pictures to the wall or fridge without making a mess. :-)These work great; it's about time something like this is available!

3M says they are reusable (but for important work I'd just use them once as they attract dust which diminishes their ability to stick).We hung a collectable china plate on the wall with 2 of these.

These Scotch Reusable Tabs work GREAT for hanging stuff on walls.

At work they keep my calculator holder in place even with frequent (and haphazard) use.
