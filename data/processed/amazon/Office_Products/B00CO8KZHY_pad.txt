The pad itself contains 100 sheets of paper that are perforated and tear off the pad easily. The pad is attached to the cover with glue and it is not refillable. This pad comes in a great looking black hardcover with a strap that holds it shut. This pad is disposable and can&#8217;t be refilled but it has 100 sheets in it so it should last you at least several months. This little pad is a handy office tool and you don't necessarily have to use it for phone messages. The pad is small enough that you can tote it around from meeting to meeting and the cover is quite sturdy. This pad won't break down from use. This pad has plenty of room to write whatever you want. So, for what this pad provides--wide lines, a check-off column and a tear-off section for immediate and urgent reminders--I can honestly say that I like this product.I do especially like that the perforated bottom &#34;red light&#34;, &#34;red letter&#34; section easily tears off without ripping. This is a cute little pad that I actually find rather useful but the design is not quite what I would have wanted. This pad overall is really nice looking. The 6" x 8-3/8" pad itself--made of recycled paper--is glued into a lightweight, probably washable, hardcover binding. If you want the pad out on your desktop, you can fold the hardcover binding effortlessly into a low triangular stand that supports the pad at a comfortable writing angle.The individual "Things to Do Today" sheets tear off easily--there are perforations along the top of each sheet, and also along the top of the red-printed "Can't Wait" area. However, whether this particular pad is a good choice for you will depend on whether it fits your budget. It almost seems like it was adapted from a pad for some other purpose (telephone messages?) I ended up peeling this pad away from the cover and using the blank backside for jotting down notes and making grocery lists. The pad closes with an elastic band. The actual pad cover of my product is solid black (black paper adhered to cardboard) and quite handsome. Since the pad is not replaceable, the entire product is disposable. Overall, this is a great little pad and has made my job a lot easier (and makes me look good b/c I deliver the messages in a organized/complete fashion!) The pad has 2 sections, urgent and dated notes. It is pretty pad to carry around. I couldn't get the pad to stay at an angle and the red DO NOW notes need to have stickies on the back to be truly useful. The pad itself has a black cover and backing. The pad can carried around easily.Each page has eight lines to list what needs to be done that are alternately white and tan. The pad is also easy to carry around alone or  in brief case. I would prefer the pad to be a third or so smaller so that it takes up less space and is less obtrusive.2. There also appears to be no pad refills. Overall though, I like the pad. The pad doesn't need it at all.

For those concerned, the one-hundred (100) pad sheets consist of recycled paper meeting US government standards.

I was excited when I saw this pad because I thought it would be great on my desk.

I really like the pad, that being said there are a few things I don't like, the binder feels very flimsy.
