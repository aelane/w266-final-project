The size is perfect too. The size is perfect for me and the way I calibrate my mouse tracking. A larger size is available (MW310LE).If you need a mouse pad that works well with optical devices, the 3M Compact Mouse Pad with Gel Wrist Rest (MW309LE) is an excellent choice. It's about the same size as other mousepads of its kind. But it's just the right size as I don't have to do large movements to go between my two monitor screens. It's the perfect size for a laptop however. The rounded size is just right for me. The size of the mouse pad seems just right to me as well.I use an optical mouse, and the mousing surface is very smooth, and tracks much better than my old (cheap) mouse pad. It is just the right size for my work area, not taking up valuable desk space but has ample space for the usual mouse movements. However, the size is perfect for everyday use, including surfing the web and writing emails. As for size, it could be slightly bigger, but the size still works for what I use the computer for.
