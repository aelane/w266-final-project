That will have a LOT to do with how many photos & color charts you print on a regular basis. But while it seems fast, if you are doing color there is a tiny hesitation. Also, it may seem great to have individual color cartridges, but there's a catch. The color is very vivid and seems to be of a very high quality. My first few color copies were enlargements of part of the document until I set it correctly. I felt that Epson was quite truthful about black and white and color printing as the 845 WorkForce was very quick. The color copies are super quick and accurate, which I haven't seen too much from a color copier. After struggling along with a very disappointing HP color printer that gobbles up expensive ink cartridges faster, as the old saying goes, than you can say "Jack Robinson," and not even being able to print envelopes because they regularly come out smudgy and unmailable, this smoothly functioning, efficient and attractive printer is like a breath of fresh air in my computer room. I love that I'm able to print in color or black & white, copy, fax and scan all on one machine. I also own a color laser printer (Konica Minolta) that's used for high quantity of color prints to save money on ink - but its photo quality doesn't match this.The print quality (on high quality mode) is amazing. I thought the Epson 545 would retire the color laser, however the 845 is just a few dollars more and brings a few extras to the table.Straight out of the box several things to note:This printer is labeled "World's Fastest All-in-One". It's not 6 color ink finished photo good, but for sharp and vivid everyday business and school type prints you'll be very pleased. The color is amazing and although the unit is large, it has it's own room. I've also done some color copying, and the copier was fast, and printed in beautiful, clear colors: you get a lot of bang for your buck here, with the size of this printer and what its capabilities are. Black is real fast and color is too if its general. The color photograph copies I made were beautiful and vibrant. It really excels in the color department. While I don't scan color photos too much, anymore, I put the 845 through its paces and found it produce excellent quality full color scans. Epson WorkForce 845 color inkjet multifunction printer has a lot going for it. It's completely opposite when a color fax is sent...the printer starts dialing immediately and scans once the connection is established with the receiving machine. I've had color inkjet printers in the past, I've also had them in all-in-one configurations such as this. So I eschewed color for a simple laser printer with the big, heavy, expensive, (and sometimes but rarely) messy toner cartridges and I was happy enough. It is nice to have great color on plain paper so one does not have to always use expensive special finish papers.It has every feature one could possibly want!All around pleased!
