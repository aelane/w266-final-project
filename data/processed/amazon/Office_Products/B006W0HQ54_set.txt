This set was made for some of that craft- and art-related stuff.That said, I think the tips are little too soft. The set includes 12 brightly colored markers. I WISH I had already bought this set from Sharpie. Sharpie just introduced this new "Brush Tip" set of 12, permanent markers. The set is reasonably priced, and comes on a card. If you buy a set like this, you'll find many uses for this over the years. All in all a nice set of pens. This is a special set that has bright colors and brush tips to use on any type of paper cloth or coloring page You cannot go wrong with this set. This new set of Sharpie markers has all that we have come to appreciate from the brand as well as a new tip. A versatile set of permanent markers! This set is a cross between a traditional Sharpie and a paint brush.
