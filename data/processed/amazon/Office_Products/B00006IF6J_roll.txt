This roll is wider than some I have used in the past, and is a very nice size.Besides &#34;masking,&#34; it is effective for temporarily holding posters up on painted surface where it won't peel the paint off when you take it down. This is a generous roll of masking tape, which, as the description suggests, can be used for a wide variety of purposes. It tears off the roll cleanly, sticks securely and removes without leaving residue. I make a small roll of tape for each corner on the backside of each poster. Does a roll of tape truly need a review? So far it has come off the roll cleanly and we have not had any issues with splitting. Works great comes off the roll nicely easy to stick to the wall and easy to take down. I always keep at least one roll of masking tape around the house. I do worry that now that my roll has gotten linty on the sides, it may compromise its effectiveness when it comes to making a sharp line for painting. This is an excellent roll of masking tape. It also pulls from the roll with ease; no fighting to start it.Excellent. Scotch High Performance Masking Tape is a large roll, a tad over 1 3/8 inches wide by 60 yards long.It is very sturdy at over 6 mils thick and is much easier to remove in one clean piece when compared to less durable masking tapes. A roll of Scotch High Performance Masking Tape 232 Tan, 36 mm x 55 m (Pack of 1) is around ten bucks, but I consider it well worth it for my use. Scott's provides a large roll of masking tape at 60 yards by 1 3/8th of an inch. This is a BIG roll of tape that will surely last a long time. This large roll of nicely sticky masking tape was big enough for us to tape plastic over every window in our 150 year old home.
