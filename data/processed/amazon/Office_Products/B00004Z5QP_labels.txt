These labels are so easy to set up for printing your own labels. These labels are great for use as a return address while mailing out your bills. Using labels that are printed on a computer printer keeps your mail on automation and out of the hands of humans. Avery labels are simply the best and these are the perfect size to use for a return address. These labels can also be printed individually and used on file folders or anything else that needs identification. I can't honestly say I ever found peeling labels from a backing sheet to be particularly challenging so, as far I'm concerned, the Easy Peel designation is a marketing gimmick. Once I figured it out, the labels and the software are just what I needed. As with all Avery labels I have tried, these work very well. These labels are no exception. Then I dug out my other labels of the same size, also Avery. These labels have a space of no label material in the center, just the backing material. Avery makes excellent labels that do what they claim. These are labels. These are fantastic labels, just like the rest of the Avery line. Though these labels are meant for laser printers, I was able to use them successfully with an inkjet printer. I think the Avery labels are superior to all of the off-brands that are out there (and I've tried several of those). These labels do peel very easily and no Avery label (including these) has yet jammed any of my printers. These labels print well in my HP LaserJet 3200, and they peel off easily, but they print a little too far down the page, as compared with the old model #5267 labels, and the top line of the label prints higher and higher as the labels go down the page, so about 1/4 of the labels at the bottom of the sheet have their top line cut off. These laser labels are perfect for the kind of labels that I keep handy - a few dozen printed labels for each family member, and my own return labels.I had no problem running these through my Brother laser printer, using Word 2011 for Mac, template 5267. The labels don't jam, they line up properly, and they peel easily. With 2000 labels in each pack, you'll be all set to send out those bills, letters and Christmas cards. These labels are great. I have been using these labels for organizing and mailing my graduate school application materials. These labels are extremely easy to use and they don't smear in my laser printer. Like most Avery labels, no smudging, easy to work with. As with most labels, you can get away with running the sheet through to print only a few labels and then rerunning a partial sheet for a second print of the remaining labels. Excellent labels. You know when you have ten million labels to stick on envelopes and you try bending the page so the labels are easier to pull off,but some bend and some don't, and a couple even bend too far so they get stuck to themselves and you have to sneaky throw them away so no one will see? The labels are fine - they peel and stick with ease. I'm never disappointed with Avery labels or other products, though I confess that Staples brand (when it's available) can be significantly cheaper with no apparent loss of quality. These are good, standard solid LASER labels from Avery - template suggestions are always on the package (so helpful) and I've used the 3M version, Avery version, and branded store versions (like Office Depot) - they all work well as address labels - if you are wondering how to choose, I'd make your decision based on price, and features such as the Easy Peel (which makes using a LOT of these go much faster - think Christmas card mailings, wedding/shower invitations, etc)...as well as other features like (is it for a LASER or INKJET) printer? Great labels, good size (I like these smaller address labels for return address labels) - would recommend! These Avery labels were easy to use in my home printer using the template they recommended. These are nice labels and will work for most purposed. Unfortunately, with these Avery labels, after I feed them a couple times, the adhesive seems to bleed through and the label turns a bit brown. The more expensive labels don't have that problem.So, if you plan to print one sheet at a time, this should be fine. If you plan to print only a few labels at a time, look for another product. The die-cut labels fed well through my HP laser printer, stuck well on envelopes and packages, and didn't smear. These labels may also be written on by hand when called for which is a useful benefit. Compared to the 3M labels however, the Avery labels are more expensive and I do not think the "Pop-up Edge" is as effective as 3M's "Quick Lift Design." After that they're pretty much just labels, they hold ink and stick to things.T
