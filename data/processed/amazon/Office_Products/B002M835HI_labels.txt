These labels worked great for online shipping through USPS. These labels are in the exact format that I need to print the labels I get from Amazon and other companies that send prepaid shipping labels online. I wish I realized these labels existed a long time ago; the time I've wasted by not having them. I've used them to create labels with USPS's Click-N-Ship program as well as with PayPal Shipping, and on both platforms they print out very clean, bright, and professional looking. Because the labels are so nice and thick, they don't wrinkle at all once on the package, and they entirely block out any old labels or markings on the box underneath.My business uses bulk double-sheeted labels that are thin, hard to remove from their backings, and wrinkle up with the slightest change in temperature or moisture in the air. I doubt these labels are used much by the cost-cutting corporations of the world, but if quality is worth the extra expenditure to you, then I doubt these Avery labels can be beat. And the labels are thick, ensuring that nothing shows through. However, if you don't need laser labels, I'd go with the less expensive ink jet ones as they work really well. If you online shop as much as I do, you need these labels for those occasional returns. They are generously sized so they easily cover the other labels, yet are small enough to fit a small box. Very pleased with these labels. These labels are a really convenient way to ship. When I first saw these labels I thought they were a great idea. The labels themselves have great adhesive (they are actually stickier than the DHL labels) and stay stuck to the package very well. These labels might be great for someone selling expensive items with low volume, but for those of us who sell cheap item with high volume, this pretty much kills the deal. These labels are perfect for shipping. These new Avery labels make the process much easier and more professional, and the receipt half of the sheet makes for a nice clean record I keep in my files. I love labels like this. It was super easy to use Paypal or USPS.com to make up and print my labels. We were printing out labels on regular stock white paper, cutting the label to size and attaching it to the packages with tape. These labels work with the U.S. "Avery TrueBlock labels do everything they claim! It is so much more productive to use these labels than to scrape the old labels off good shipping boxes. These labels not only save me time but they look so much more professional than my cut and paste job. These labels are very convenient for people who ship a lot of items. Even if you do not ship very often these labels are very convenient since they double as a receipt as well. These labels are a great idea and they save the shipper a little time. If you only ship a little I recommend trying these labels at least once to see if you want to invest a little more money for them for everyday use. I put labels on two cardboard boxes one weekend and put them in the garage to wait until Monday to mail - I was distressed to see that corners of the labels did lift. Since then, I have reinforced all my labels with tape - something I shouldn't have to do with this product. I highly recommend these labels. I found the labels to work well and look very professional. Avery labels are the cream of the crop, Cadillac of label brands.

The labels look really great and they block out anything underneath them, enabling you to re-use packaging. Wish I had these labels long ago. I now need more labels and will be buying these. I wasted two labels figuring this out and printing on the wrong side or wrong end.`Worth your money if it's what you need for your business or personal shipments. These labels eliminate two of those steps. We don't need labels adding to already high costs. Wonderful labels and you get to have a receipt. I really like these labels for shipping. I used these labels with PayPal's Multi Order shipping, and the placement was great. I'm using these labels with the PayPal system and they are fabulous! These new Avery labels work great with Pay Pal and are perfect for home sellers (read: small volume) via[...]. Prior to using the 5327 labels, I have experience with Avery 5126 which are two 8.5x5.5 labels on a single page instead of a single label/paper combo.Since I rely on shipping software for tracking and recordkeeping, I have no use for paper receipts and never print them. These labels save you the effort of cutting out the label and gluing it. Granted, free labels will not be as high quality as these Avery labels, but this has never really posed much of a problem  and I've been shipping using them for years.Avery has always had very high costs to their labels which is why I generally do not buy their brand. I would say if you can get free labels or cheaper ones online from eBay or a label company, that would be the way to go. So I have been printing my labels on full sheet labels, cutting the sheet down to the part that needs to go on the package, and throwing the rest away.These labels are really designed for software that prints a shipping label on half the paper, and a receipt on the other half. It made me printing the UPS or USPS labels without much trouble with a print process of eBay and attaching it on a box is simple and easy. I used the Avery labels with a Brother laser printer and did not have any paper jam or something like that so far.
