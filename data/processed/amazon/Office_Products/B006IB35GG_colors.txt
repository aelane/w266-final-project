Wow - the colors are bold & vibrant and the flow is smooth & unbreaking with no smudging. I also like to have multiple colors because grading in red gets boring, and is apparently linked to low self-esteem. They only have the green and other colors in the 300. I love the colors of the pens and the ease of writing, however after writing for a bit the pens begin to drop little blobs of ink as they write. The colors are vivid, too. I do enjoy having different colors to write with when a different mood strikes me. The colors are very sharp and appealing. I really like the colors of gel pens, so I was interested to try these colored ink pens. All the colors are vibrant and work great. Fun colors, works great.Sra.

Offered in multiple colors, these pens are good for general purpose use and they make a good choice for those who spend a good part of their day writing and need a pen that is easy on the wrists and low on the frustration scale.Papermate Inkjoy pens feature an hourglass design, so they are slightly wider at the tip for more comfortable gripping.

The colors are nice and the handle/feel is great, but since they do leave little globs here and there and do not produce a consistently clean line, I would not recommend them (unless that is not an issue for you).

The colors were vivid.
