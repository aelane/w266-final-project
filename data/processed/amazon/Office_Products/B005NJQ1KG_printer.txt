This 1200 DPI printer, which whips out copies at 29 per minute, is an awesome addition to my office.The paper feeder holds 250 pages, so is a very nice size if you print a great deal. This printer is exclusively for home use for me; I have no business use for it and am quite happy with it on that level. I'd give the printer five stars, but the replacement toner cartridge isn't cheap and to my mind the optimal laser printer would come with more reasonably priced toner. It's nice to use a monochromic printer for general documents.Operation:  Start up is relatively quick for a Home/Office Printer/scanner/copier/fax machine. I just plugged in the printer onto our wireless router, and walked through the process through my System Preferences. This can print and scan from this printer easily. This printer is a great black and white printer. This is a great printer to use for just everyday printing or making numerous copies. I had to use another printer for scanning and copying, and have been looking for something to do double sided printing, so as to save paper.This printer fit the bill perfectly. This printer really is just plain easy to use.My one complaint about the printer itself is that it's really surgey. When I turn this printer on, it has a tendency to trip the circuit breaker at times, and otherwise affect other things that are plugged in. I liked this printer a lot. The printer didn't recognize it. So, for now, this printer sits unplugged and unused.ADDED (April, 2013): First an update about the generic toner. I have been using this printer for a while now and have been very happy with it. This printer has made me as happy as the Brother so far and I think that is saying a lot because the Brother is a very highly regarded printer. This printer has just worked for me without issue like one would hope that any product would and I would highly recommend it.
