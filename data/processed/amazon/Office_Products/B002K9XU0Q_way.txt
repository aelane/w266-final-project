A way to use and reuse LABELED file folders again and again. It is really wonderful the way you can remove a label and replace it with another one without any hassle or tearing of labels or file folders. I'm planning to use them in this way when I reorganize my craft room and closet shelves. I haven't tried that way and will not. It would have been nice if it showed up the way it should have though.) This way it just makes it neater and easier to reuse file folders and save a tree. One I pulled all the way off after a few minutes and it did curl a little. Unfortunately there is no way to report any "long term" testing at this time (i.e., if your records storage is not climate controlled - but I have no reason to suspect any problems). I think these are a great way to really organize your files, and know you can easily remove a label and not destroy a folder over it. They tell you which way to feed the paper if you are going to use a printer. I found one that had made its way, somehow, from my home office out to reappear in my car.
