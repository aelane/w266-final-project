excellent post its, the main difference is the whole back is sticky unlike regular post its which are sticky on one edge only. Finally, a REALLY stick post it note. Basically these are glorified "post it" notes, nothing more, nothing less. I usually get annoyed when my post its curl up and I like that I have the option to use these and they stick entirely down. They have that post it note glue on the back and are very bright. unlike normal post it where only the top portion is sticking the WHOLE back of these are sticky so they adhere to boxes, plastic bins, and other surfaces very nicely without falling off. My post it notes always linger on the fridge for weeks! They are stronger than the average post it note, and I even feel comfortable using them in my cookbooks for notes so next time I will remember to add an extra cup of this or a little less of that. These are like sticky post it notes with about an 1/4 inch non-stick area that lets you remove the label if you change your mind. As a post it compulsive person, I like the idea of these. They're also great for recycling as long as the post office doesn't start throwing envelopes around.
