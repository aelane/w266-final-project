Now when my book gets dropped none of the makers will get lost.I haven't had to do any mechanical work on my truck lately but the next time I do I will be using these in my Chilton's manual. As I read the book, this list moves along with me as a quick reference. When I get a new technical book I pull off a bunch of the little arrows from their pad and stick them on the inside of the back cover. Not only do they make great book markers but nice "Post It's" for phone numbers etc along with note book dividers as well. They are easily applied to a book or notebook page to mark a passage of interest, and quite as easily removed. I found that one placed in the book I was reading pretty much filled the page, but that's the point. The book is a textbook and isn't on the best of paper.These are by Avery and Avery makes some pretty cool supplies for school and work.The reason I gave these a 4 star instead of a 5 is that when I was tearing one of the sheets off of the tablet, it tore. I was worried that if I left them in the book for too long that the page would get damaged or that the print would be removed from the page. These were advertised as good for sticking onto a book page and being able to highlight and write on them without marring your actual book. I'll also looked at Levenger book margins, but they are very expensive and still obscure the pages. Highlighting a book is one sure way to decrease its value. they are easy to find even if you put them completely within the book, and the transparency lets me see everything underneath. If I plan to leave it in a book permanently I can even highlight the Notetab without damaging the book. I actually placed one of these in a book and put a yellow sticky square on it. I feel like I shouldn't use these in a book in case the marker bleeds through, pushing hard on a pen or pencil makes indentations on the actual page, or the glue sticks too well and damages the paper when removing it. These are wonderful, especially if you are in a book club and like to mark pages in a book without actually ruining the page with ink.

but don't want to destroy the book, these work.

They are simply too thick if used too much in one book.

I used one as, essentially, a book mark.
