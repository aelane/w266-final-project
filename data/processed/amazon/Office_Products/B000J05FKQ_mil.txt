3 mil is thick enough for everyday or even heavy use - I mostly use my laminator to create bookmarks. These 3 mil pouches are really great! I like the 3 mil size-- it's not super-stiff, so I can use it on things I want to hang on the fridge (a strong magnet holds right through it, whereas a magnet won't hold when I use thicker laminating pouches).A good deal if you plan on doing a lot of laminating! This 3 mil pouch is a good fit for that usage, since it's not horrendously stiff but it does protect the pattern.The patterns I laminated are holding up beautifully! Fellowes Hot Laminating Pouches, Letter, 3 mil, 100 Pack (52454)is a very useful set of lamination sheets for preserving documents/items that are 9 x 11 dimensions (slightly larger than a letter sheet of paper). I use the 3 mil Fellowes Hot Laminating Pouches on aFellowes Saturn SL 9.5 Inch Laminatorwith consistently good results (no bubbling, and minimal, if any warping).Sized at 9 x 11.5 inches, the pouches will leave a quarter inch border around a letter size document. Both the 1.5 mil and 3 mil pouches are very flexible. The 3 mil pouches are great for general use. There is also a 5 mil thickness for projects that need extra durability. I've been using the 3 mil, 100 pack for hot lamination using aFellowes Saturn 2 95 Laminator, 9.5-Inch (5727001). I like using the 3 mil pouches since they don't appear so thick and ridged.The only issue I had was when I didn't wait for the laminator to warm up enough and had to pass the pouch through twice. Compared to 3M's 3 mil laminating pouches, the Fellowes pouches feel stiffer. I actually prefer the 3M because I expect 3 mil to give me a bit of flexibility. The 3 mil thickness that I also reviewed is perfectly fine for documents that won't be subjected to constant handling but deserve preservation nonetheless. Fellowes Hot Laminating Pouches, Letter, 3 mil are a great way to protect your documents. The 3 mil strength is flexible, yet still sturdy. The 3 mil size is only so big, but I only use them to laminate copier paper or the occassional cardstock. At 3 mil thick, this is not the most durable of laminating pouches; HOWEVER - having most recently used the 5 mil to laminate some pages to be used repetitively and finding them just a little too stiff, I wish I'd had these when I did that project. 3 mil is the weight of a typical trash bag and is very thin.For both the 3 and 5 mil pouches, the finished items are VERY clear and transparent with a glossy finish. The 5 mil doesn't cost much more and is noticeably stiffer.
