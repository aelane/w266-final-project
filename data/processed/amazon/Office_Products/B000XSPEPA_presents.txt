Wrapping presents takes time and one of the greatest frustrations is the misplacing of the tape dispenser. When wrapping many presents for birthday and Christmas a few months ago, I wished I had precut pieces of tape that I could just pull off of something to make it go a lot faster. (At least, you would if you wrapped presents like a guy....LOTS OF TAPE!!) Well, after using it to wrap all my Christmas presents, I've been converted for life. I needed to wrap several presents so it got a good workout. Can I wrap Christmas presents without it? It's great for wrapping presents. I only wrapped a few presents using this dispenser but it doesn't seem like it would hold a lot of tape. That would mean that I could only wrap about 15 presents with one pad of tape.I have to say, though, that the usefulness of having the tape dispenser on my hand (it doesn't slip or turn either! When wrapping Christmas or Birthday presents, I used to find that I would have to let go of the paper to tear off a piece of tape. I had to wrap birthday presents and I was really glad to have this small and simple contraption. This really helps out when you are wrapping presents. While wrapping Christmas presents, I was able to conserve a great deal of time because the Handband Dispenser that fits so readily around ones wrist frees the same hand for the process of preparing gifts. I'm generally pleased with it, though, as far as wrapping presents. I'd thought that it would be easier to wrap presents with this, and then as I was wrapping a small gift that soon looked like I wrapped it in duct tape because the strands are so long (2 inches).For larger packages it worked fine (though ti fell apart on me a couple times), but overall, I did not think it was vastly superior to the much more affordable scotch tape that I normally use.
