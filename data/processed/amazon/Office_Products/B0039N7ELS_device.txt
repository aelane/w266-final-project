This neat little device lays down dots of adhesive in a straight or curved line as desired, which form a strong bond between pieces of paper. I like this little glue device! Scotch Adhesive Dot Roller is a useful device that makes a practical alternative to glue, ordinary tape, and other types of adhesive. The device needs to be held near a ninety- degree angle in order for it to work. I have found this device most useful for adhering small pictures to a scrapbook and it is also very useful for self- printed address labels. This device is more compact than its closest competitors, but for cost and efficiency, there are some better options available.Still, in spite of the relatively small amount of tape and the price, I like the Scotch Adhesive Dot Roller. You roll the device across a flat surface, just as with correcting tape, leaving behind a trail of adhesive dots in your wake. This device is really handy and convenient, and, as other reviewers have mentioned, it's great for hobbies such as scrapbooking and creating photo albums. Well that is what this little device does.First, there's no mess. With this device, you just roll the little dots on to the paper.The only negative, would be the price point, it does cost more than a bottle of Elmer's Glue, but it can be handy for envelopes that refuse to seal, stamps that have lost their sticky and for a quick scrap book craft item.

This device is used for gluing papers together and perhaps for gluing other things.

The device, which is transparent scarlet on one side and opaque on the other side, fits easily in the hand.

This cool little device lets you apply tiny amounts of glue to the back of photos, papers or whatever, neat and clean, no spill, no over glueing to rumple your work or catch fingerprints.
