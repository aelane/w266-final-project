I liked these boxes. They boxes are well made and strong. The boxes all come with perforated cuts in them. Yes, they are more expensive that regular moving boxes, but how much is your time and sanity worth? Banker's boxes are the perfect size for 90% of the things in most household moves, and because they are smaller than most moving boxes they are never too heavy for most people, even kids, to carry, even if they are packed with books. When I was younger I would always pack the big boxes first and pile them high with books. These boxes are perfect for those things &#8211;like heavy books or knick-knacks.+ POST CONSUMER RECYCLED MATERIAL. I use these boxes for magazines and other collected items (that I should probably discard). What matters with evaluating boxes like these is ease of assembly, strength of construction and practicality. These boxes are a breeze to assemble and a pleasure to do so since no tape is needed. I needed some boxes to pack up my classroom for the summer and found these to be perfect! These boxes are the perfect size to fit four 6-packs of beer, and sturdy enough to be stacked. These boxes will bend out of square even when new. One of my boxes was not glued together because a piece of cardboard stamped out of a flap had fallen into the glue preventing the seams from meeting. These are great boxes for storage or moving. They designed the boxes to be folded for use with no tape needed and then unfolded flat for compact storage. I am not sure the boxes will safely transport or store heavy items. These are great boxes for moving, Bankers Box brand makes high quality sturdy boxes, and I have had nothing but good quality from their SmoothMove line. These boxes are awesome - nice and sturdy and easy to assemble (once you figure out which line to tear on and which to fold on - I did mess up the first one). I recommend looking for the best price.These boxes are made of brown cardboard. When moving or storing you typically just try to find random boxes and make them work. These boxes are easy to assemble, sturdy and are great for storing my old manuscripts and old taxes. These boxes are a real boon for home organizing. For that, you should get moving boxes from U-Haul or a regular moving company. The boxes are too small to allow you to overpack and the handles are useful for carrying them to your car, then into your apartment. I intend to use these boxes to put some of my things into storage.That said, they're not super heavy-duty. Not many moving boxes can take the weight of those two items without collapsing.They are easy to assemble after you figure out how to put the first one together. These are boxes. And they are boxes. I recently moved, and used several of these boxes for small heavy objects. These boxes are so durable that after packing, loading, unloading, and unpacking, they're all in perfect condition, so I'm using them as storage boxes in the basement.
