Great printer for the money. This printer is perfect for us. )The printer starts up fast and prints fast. This printer is USB 2.0 high-speed-compatible.The printer is made in China but seems well made for a Chinese-assembled product. This printer seems like a workhorse.Aren't neighbors wonderful (many times). I noticed this Brother printer at a good price with a nice rebate. I'm happy with this printer and would recommend it to the average home user who occasionally needs to print in Black and White. I bought this printer a few months ago to replace the HP 1000 that HP stoppled supporting. This is a great little printer with all the positive attributes that are checked here. The printer warms up fairly fast and is ready to print in about 2 minutes from turn on (I leave mine off unless ready to print). I've been using this printer for some months with OS X, currently it's attached to a Snow Leopard machine using native SL drivers.It would be a fine printer -- it if were more reliable. I bought this printer to replace my Brother HL 2040. Like the 2040 before it, this printer promises to be a reliable and efficient workhorse. Believe it or not, it is sometimes less expensive to buy a new printer than to buy a new toner cartridge. )OTHERThis is a great printer for home or personal use. This printer really worked fine for the first few months.
