I really lke this printer and especially like the fact that is does not need as much space as my all in one printer . This is the printer for me. I think the printer could be made with such a screen without sacrificing more space and without a great deal of cost given the small surface area. AWESOME!It's not the fastest printer in the world...but the quality, so far, is amazing. This is a nice and easy to use printer. The printer is very small and does not take up much room. The printer did include 4 pages of photo paper, so that was a nice bonus.Another downfall is that it uses ink 61 which has a very low pages yield (black 190, color 165), it also uses one cartridge for color which means if you run out of one color (but still have a lot of another color) you will have to replace it, the ink is not that expensive, but I prefer a printer that uses a higher ink yield cartridge.In the end this is a nice printer, it does not have the best printing for low light photos, but it is small and compact and offers a lot of features. I purchased the first HP Envy printer when it first came out (model 100) because of how attractive it is for the livingroom or other non-office home area. The 5530 is more obviously a printer and looks better in a home office.It produces very attractive copies and scans. It works well wifi and with hp printer android smartphone app.I love the black sheen and design of the HP Envy line and this 5530 is a good choice for the home printer for those who demand a beautiful output with ease of use in an occasional volume. The printer quickly recognized that a firmware upgrade was necessary to allow me to use HP ePrint from my iPhone. The Mac woke the printer from sleep (again a better result than some competing brand printers) and was able to print one or two sided pages without difficulty, and without requiring any additional software installation.The print quality is quite good. My old printer cable worked and the software guided me through the set-up. This printer is excellent (and I've had A LOT of printers). It's the first printer I've had that wasn't a pain in the you now what to add to our network. I love an intuitive printer. Once the printer was connected to the internet, it asked if I want to enable &#8216;webservice&#8217; and &#8216;auto update&#8217; so I tapped OK. The printer being wireless is another advantage. This printer has double side printing feature,and it was quick and easy, and it saves paper.Secondly, HPConnected service is quite convenient and has some nice features. This printer can be connected to internet and managed online. I am actually thinking about buying this printer for my parents so they can effortlessly receive prints of their grandson from their home. However, I was really surprised how thin this printer is yet with all the great features. This printer offers more features than any other home printers and it is really easy to use and operate/maintain. This printer is working very well with all of my i-devices and multiple Macs with ease. However, this printer is eligible for HP Instant Ink subscription that might actually cost less to maintain your printing needs. Maintaining can&#8217;t be any easier with this hyper-connected printer. Unpacking the printer took longer than setting it up. I purchased this printer to print, so far I have jammed paper. This printer is small enough and light enough to take on the road with me and fills niche when I need a document printed when away from home. Quieter than the average all-in-one printer. Your printer must be connected to the Internet so that it can order new cartridges for when you are running low. Currently our printer needs the ink cartridges replaced every 45 days or so at a hefty price tag of sixty-five dollars! IF you need an inexpensive printer that can print borderless photos in an instant that can rival your Kinkos then this might be a good candidate for your home.

Unboxing and setting this printer up to get ready for some printing, scanning, and copying took about 15 minutes total.

Then the printer showed that the alignment and calibration was successful.

As I expected, the printer did not recognize 5 GHz N network, but had no problem connecting to 2.4 GHz network.
