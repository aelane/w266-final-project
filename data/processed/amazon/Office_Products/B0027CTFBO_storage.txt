There are storage boxes and there are moving boxes. They are much cheaper than purchasing those plastic storage containers and work just as well. That is fine if used for storage. But, for indoor storage and do-it-yourself moves, these are as good as it gets. They are also easy to disassemble and they readily fold flat again for compact storage. This is the most useful storage item I have ever come across, not that Im a storage expert. We plan to use it as a temporary storage box once we move in. Super strong, good for storage or multiple moves.. Also breaks down easily for storage before reuse. However, for storage and occasional use, they are good. I likely will use some for storage as well, but prefer boxes with removable lids for that purpose. As storage boxes, they're easy to get in and out of, and as moving boxes, you're not in trouble if you forgot to put that last spatula in one of the "Kitchen" boxes.The box quality is pretty decent, too. Definitely good for moving, and not too shabby for long-term storage. Not excessively so, but enough that I'd not want to use them for storage of items that I need to get to regularly. For moving, or for long-term storage, I would say these are easily the best boxes I've used. They fold down for empty storage and reuse just fine, don't just toss them!Here's my old way of packing for a move:- begging for boxes from friends, the local convenient mart and wherever (receiving 20 or so boxes in at least 10 different sizes and shapes)- burn a gallon or two of gas in the process- pay for some packing tape and then start packing- once the box collection is filled (either fully or  partially), trying to load them into a truck or van, and cursing every moment of the 3D puzzle that I've created- arriving at my destination, then uttering a quick prayer and gritting my teeth prior to opening the back door and learning whether or not the 3D puzzle of boxes has shifted or collapsed- then trucking the stuff inside on a 2-wheel dolly, balancing one oddball stack after another- gingerly opening any box that shows signs of crushing and hoping that the stuff inside is none the worse for wear- overloading the dumpster and risking cuts or worse as I try to dispose of all the used boxes- spending the next day cursing myself or some well-meaning friend who didn't realize that large boxes are for towels and packed 80 pounds of books into one, thus straining my back during the move.- exercise my patience for the next month by chasing bugs and other stowaways from the free boxes that hitched a ride in from the back room of the "donor" locationNow, with Smooth Move Moving Boxes, it's a lot different:- order them from Amazon and have them come to my door- assemble them and load each one, nothing the nice suggestions for use that are already printed.- realizing that, since each box is a standard height, width and length, I can stack them on a 2-wheeler without overloading it (or my back)- driving to the new location without hearing any boxes shifting or glass breaking in the back- unloading the vehicle once we're there (no worries or breakage)- folding down the boxes and storing them away for the next time.- realizing that my crew and I have extra time to toast the fact that the best way to recycle cardboard is to just keep it clean and reuse it next time!Trust me... Or use them as more permanent storage. But, that's ok as they are nice looking as well and will be able to be stored in his storage area for years to come. I am currently only using the one I loaded up for storage purposes, but I'm glad I have the rest for that same purpose or if I choose to move anytime soon. If you're looking to use them just for storage, I'd consider buying plastic tubs instead, since they retail for about the same price. These storage boxes are wonderful. I plan to reuse them for storage. These are great storage boxes and that is why I got them. These would be great for moving or storage. If you have a storage need, this is a great solution. And as I said, they are good for storage, but if you are moving...these are the boxes you want for moving!I
