These phones are perfect! These phones have an excellent sound quality, a worthwhile volume control, (not just a "high low" like others phones), and pretty much have all the fun and useful goodies that one can expect out of new phones these days. This phones light comes on very brightly when turned on, or when a call is received. Cordless phones are relatives of cell phones. I would have liked for the phones to come with a clip and maybe an earpiece jack. The phones use a battery pack the size of two "AAAs" (included), which makes the phones pretty light. I was surprised the phones were so light and actually weighed less than half of one of our old Panasonic cordless phones.Out of the box, these were super simple to use. I have had more expensive phones and these work just as well. It will expand up to five phones, using CS6309 accessory handsets, stores 50 calls, with a 100 name and number phone book directory. I've been using these phones for about two months now and today ordered another extension to replace an old phone I still had in another room in the house. I've used Vtech phones for quite a while now, dating back to a 900Mhz basic unit that was one of the first cordless phones I purchased for my home. Those phones, I believe, were made by a company named Uni.. something (and would seem to belong in a den). They were 5.8Ghz phones and they don't seem to interfere with the WiFi in the house. The phones aren't flashy (side detour here: these are listed as 'white and black' phones while in reality, they are more 'silver and black' phones) but they work as required. And the phones tramsmitt Loud and Clear with no destortion or interfearence.
