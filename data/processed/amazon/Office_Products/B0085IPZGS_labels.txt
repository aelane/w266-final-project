It also comes with labels, but no instructions on how to set them up on the computer -- do they correspond with Avery label number XXX or ....?This IS an incentive to see more of Smead's products (including their file boxes, which appear to be very nice, very functional), however, as the kit seems to be well-thought-out - however the contents of this kit, as I said before, do not justify the price. It's also nice that they include the labels. The labels are 1 1/4 x 3 7/16 inches. And just buy the labels separately. The included labels are also large to make them easier to read.Each folder has a deep cut-out under the tab which exposed part of the document inside. There are labels (one sheet) including 16 labels. These are big labels, and that part I really like. The labels are standard &#34;Avery&#34; style labels. The labels are sized just like a standard mailing label, about 1.5 x 3" wide. These labels are very difficult to see to write on before you take them off the page. These are white labels that make the file folders look kind of sloppy. More labels & more folders in more colors. The larger labels are a good idea but I do think that for the retail price, the card stock should be a bit heavier.The paper-bag brown doesn't coordinate very well with the hospital-blue and -green but as my great aunt frequently said, "De gustibus non est disputandum." I appreciated the larger labels because I was writing them by hand. I measured the labels themselves as approximately one and a quarter inches by three and a half inches.There is a one page sheet that is also included. The labels can be used with Ink Jet or Laser Printers.Overall it's a basic organizational kit, but it gets the job done and is good value for money.
