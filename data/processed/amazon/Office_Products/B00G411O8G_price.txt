The price is reasonable and it works as expected. Well worth the price! They aren't the cheapest, but for the price you seem to get a better quality product. The price per pouch at this point is fifteen cents, which is a bit high, and you can do better by buying in bigger bulk, but for infrequent uses, this is perfect and well priced, especially considering Prime shipping.I do recommend these pouches for photos over using placing two photos on the standard 8.5x11&#34; laminating sheet. But they come at a decent price and work well enough. So, choose on price per unit since nothing about this product stands out. The price for a twenty-pouch pack seems reasonable, and is great for those who like to have some photo pouches on hand, but regular users may find a significant saving with bulk packages. It's also a great price for a 20-pack. I think for the price, these pouches are a very good deal. The price is very good for home laminating and these worked in my 3M laminator without a hitch.If you have ever taken something to an office store and paid the exorbitant price they charge for laminating, you will want to get your own laminator, and when you do, these pouches fit the bill nicely. The price is right and I have no complaints about these.

You might want to check out the price per pouch and get the 100 pack if it is cheaper and you plan to do a lot of laminating.

These are really nice, especially at the price point/value offered.

I have checked the price and they are a bit more dear than the GBC equivalent, but when it becomes time to order again, at least I'll know there's an alternative and will probably order based upon price/delivery options.
