They are WAY better than that blue putty stuff I have used in the past. I'll be using these from now on to hang stuff for my kids. So much better then that putty stuff that claims it doens't damage your wall. These are good for light stuff that the expensive heavy-duty 3M stuff is just overkill for.If you have a lot of light things you want to stick up - this is a good way to go. The Scotch Reusable Tabs truly are "reusable" unlike most of the other sticky "stuff" I have tried. We have been using that crummy putty stuff to hang items on our 100-year-old stone walls at work. ), and I loved that stuff - posters never came down on their own. The stuff I used when I was in college (looked like a cross between chewed gum and playdoh) worked ok, sometimes TOO well as I couldn't get it off of the walls. Good stuff! My favorite stuff is poster putty andJ-B Weld Stik, but those aren't right for everything. Good for putting stuff all over dorm walls as the adhesive does not lift the paint. This new stuff is almost like gelatin, and molds at an almost molecular level to whatever it touches.Of course, at $.14 apiece they are about 400% more costly than tacks or pushpins, so that may cut down on casual use a bit.
