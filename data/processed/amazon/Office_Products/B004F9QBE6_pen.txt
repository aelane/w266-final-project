This pen is really thin and obviously made for the delicate hands of a small woman.....which I am not! Overall it's a good solid pen. Although these were slightly thinner than a normal pen, it was not that much of a difference that it made writing that much easier. I like this pen, and it writes well, without skipping or fading. If Bic would make this pen in a "click" style, with this skinny barrel, and maybe turned down the "for her" stuff, this would be more of a winner in my book. I prefer a bulkier, more solid pen and these feel very light and thin. This pen is not the solution for me. Give me instead a nicely rounded pen with a rubber grip. I already used one pen completely and it never skipped or blotched till the end. I grew up using Bic's...not my favorite pen but a good one to have inyour purse...the great thing is if you lose it they have a great pricetag. I don't know particularly if I really need a pen that is smaller around the barrel to write....it has never seemed like much of a problem, but then again I have long piano fingers, so maybe this is an issue for others.... I haven't used a BIC pen for years. I guess no pen is perfect. After using the pen for 1/4 of a day about 1/10 of the ink has already been used. The Bic Cristal for Her pen produces a smudgeless, clear line. When I first held this pen, which is designed to be slightly thinner than an average Bic, I feared it might draw too fine a line, or perhaps use less ink than needed, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it created the standard thickness. My first South African Diamond pen I've yet to own! I thought the pen was fine, but my neighbor (a woman) thought it was too thin. All in all, a regular pen but with a smaller diameter, which may or may not be a plus for you. ), they ALWAYS leave the pen behind. If you are looking for a typical pen, if you like the different colors, and if you don't mind a thin pen, then these will be perfect. Not outstanding, but a decent pen. But I would not choose this pen over a standard BIC.That said, I used to work in an office where I was the only woman...and the men stole my pens all the time! But I'm not saying that it's a bad pen. I don't need a feminine pen. I need a comfortable pen with a lot of good ink in it. If I leave a normal pen on my desk, it disappears within hours if not minutes. The pen also seems skinnier than regular Bic pens, and I am not sure why that is supposed to appeal to women or to men for that matter, because I think the pens are kind of uncomfortable to hold. Before BIC Pens for Her were available, I was forced to carry a regular man-sized pen in my purse. I need to carry a pen so I can jot down my phone number for the many men I meet who want to buy me shiny things.But, the substantial weight of the sophisticated man-sized instrument completely altered my ability to walk in an eye-catching alluring sway while wearing five inch stilettos. I was curious as to what a pen made for "her" would be like. So far, I don't think I've met a Bic pen that I haven't been pleased with. This is really a regular pen.
