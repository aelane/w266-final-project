Maybe I'm just not holding the dispenser correctly. You can tear it using the dispenser. It comes in a dispenser with a straight edge tape cutter. This new dispenser is much more attractive and is a bit easier to use. The dispenser if very handy, it's easy to use and find in a full drawer. This dispenser lets you tear off from a long roll just the length of Post-it you want to use. The dispenser is all plastic and the "cutting edge" is not quite sufficient for a clean tear every time.Pros:- Fun!! It would be nice if 3M offered a re-usable dispenser and economy-sized refills.PROs:* Tons of uses - label, annotate, flag - kitchen, garage, workshop, office* Choose-your-length: Makes this stuff super versatile, useful, un-wastful- Adhesive - Stronger than Post-its, but still removable.- Dispenser is very nice to look at and holdCONs:* Tear-off - edges are rough, sometimes skewed. They're going in the wrong direction.- Throw-away dispenser: a tribute to wastefulness and carelessness.- No economy-size refills offered I would like to see the dispenser be refillable. You can use the dispenser it is on to make a clean edge wherever you want.It fits nicely in my hand and has a clean look.Thank you so much Amazon Vine for allowing me to review this product. I thought that if a dispenser would cut the paper without ragged edges, this would be close to perfect and that I would have loved the actual product (and given it 5 stars), however, the realty is the dispenser does not do as good a job as scissors do. Hold the dispenser upside down (with sticky side of the tape facing down). The dispenser does not have a serrated edge so you have to be careful when tearing off a section or you won't get a straight edge. I wish the dispenser had a sharper cutting edge. It comes in a dispenser, similar to scotch tape, so you can pull off however much you need. I'm going to pick up another dispenser in pink. The dispenser is curved and the part next to the end of the tape is hollow, which prevents writing. I think it would be nice if it came on a heavy dispenser, like scotch tape does too.The only issue I found is that you have to tear it off, write on it, then unstick it from whatever you were using as a writing surface. This Post-it dispenser has a blunt edge on the dispenser so that when you tear off a piece of Post-it, it leaves a ragged rough edge. This dispenser requires that you have to put your finger under the end and onto the adhesive side of the Post-it and then pull out the Post-it tape. The dispenser is easy to toss in a briefcase or tote bag and stay intact!
