The gel has just enough give to be comfortable, but bounces right back after I've been resting on it for awhile. The gel is extremely comfortable and the pad has a nice heft to it and will not shift at all on your desk. This is a nicer gel pad than the last few that I've had. Press the gel, they zoom in. The 3M gel wrist pad is comfortable for prolonged typing/keyboard use, and it is simple to clean. The gel allows me to keep my wrists at the proper height, and gives me enough support to type all day without whimpering all evening. This gel filled wrist rest provides me with just enough of a "bump" to keep my arm in proper line while typing, and works well to relieve the nerve pain that I sometimes get when on the computer for long stretches of time. The clear gel design makes this wrist pad really comfortable. It is very comfortable, as the gel molds around your wrists and supports them very well. I have always avoided the gel wrist rests in favor of foam, but this one is so comfortable that I will be giving gel rests more consideration in the future. The gel that is used to make the rest is also fun to poke at. - the gel is really neat, and my co-workers have commented on how stylish it is, as well as how much they like the gel. squish the gel stuff), and people compliment me on it often - a GREAT buy! Although I'm content without the gel wrist rest, I hear that it's a better idea to have one to avoid carpel tunnel so I'm trying to use this thing. The gel is solid and everything remained intact. I love this gel rest!
