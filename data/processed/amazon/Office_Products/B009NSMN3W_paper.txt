As of March 2013, only wide-ruled paper is available for a refill. Once I use up the paper in this pad, I'll probably just go back to the old fashioned legal pad. The paper is easily accessible. I think this paper pad is ingenious.Pros:* Refillable. Now all the paper is replaced and each section of the note pad is separated with a tab. I'm a paper lover!! This paper is nothing fancy - just very standard quality lined 8 x 11" note paper that just happens to also have two holes punched across the top to hold it all together. The paper is nice, and it has a micro perforation across the top, in line with the clasp, so you can tear the punch holes off and turn in a normal-looking piece of paper. The paper is thin, but it has a nice finish. The paper has two holes and rests on the pegs. To close this you have to make sure the paper is not coving the pegs . If the paper is covering the pegs the clip is  hard to close. While it doesn't hold as much paper, it also doesn't add as much bulk. The paper is basically loose leaf lined and ruled paper with two holes across the top instead of three along the side. Also, loading the paper into the top is a little awkward, especially if you're doing it on the fly, as the top piece will easily fall off entirely. Unfortunately, I find that moving around the paper and re-positioning the dividers is cumbersome.

The paper tears off clean without having to undo the clip.

Strange to say about a paper tablet but it is true.

Plus, you'll be able to choose your own paper and not be stuck with wide-rule-lined loose leaf.
