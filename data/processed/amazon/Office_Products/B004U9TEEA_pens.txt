The pens are retractable, and they have a soft grip making it more comfortable to hold.I half-expected these to be difficult to write with like so many other colorful pens I've used, but I was wrong! These are smooth-rolling pens, so you can write in fun colors with ease! I am really pleased with these pens. These are really nice pens, and the colors are very pretty, but the plastic is very lightweight, and the writing from them is a little lighter than I usually like. My favorite pens are extra-fine point felt tip pens, though, so for someone who likes a retractable ball-point, these were just about the nicest I've used! I have always used RSVP pens but thought I would try something new and I am glad that I did. I used these pens in the house (and not in my purse) and I'm glad I did. I kept these pens in a metal container on my counter, so they didn't see abuse. The pens glide so smoothly on paper! I was really pleased with these pens when they arrived - such striking colors, and a great variety to boot. These pens seem to be of about the same quality as the ones that you get from businesses with their advertising on them. I've always loved colored pens and these are great.The variety of colors is good and they write well. Assorted pens that do not write that well, but for the price, acceptable. I use these pens everyday. You can never have enough pens. I may be in my 40s, but I enjoy using colored pens for various tasks, from creating gift tags to writing notes for my nieces. I love using these pens. When I first got these pens I wondered if there was any difference between these InkJoy pens and any others. I love pens, and I love bright colors. The eight pens in this assortment cover the spectrum, from the typical black, blue and red to green, purple, orange, turquoise and hot pink.The pens are very lightweight, but they feel good in my hand. All six of the other pens work easily.The best thing about these pens is the ink. The pens I received look exactly like the picture Amazon has posted. The pens are a nice range of colors and work beautifully for crafts and writing in journals.These Paper mate pens are cheaply priced, so I was afraid that they would not write smoothly. Some colored pens have too much ink to come out and they result in ugly smears. You do not have to worry about that with these pens. The pens write like expensive gel pens and you never have to try to get them to write. These are good pens . Before writing with them though, as with many other pens these days, there is a "tip seal". I love these pens! I love these pens!First off, not that it is a big deal, but the pens do not look like the ones in the picture... the plastic part is colored the same as the ink color, not clear plastic as pictured. These pens wrote consistent lines across and up-down on documents that provided little resistance to pressure. The Paper Mate "Ink Joy" colored pens are great. I tried each of the eight asosrted colored pens on computer paper, stationary and glossy cardstock. These pens are easy to use and once you have written the text it is easy to read. I've been looking for InkJoy pens to try, but haven't had much success locally. So far, I've used the red and green pens for Christmas cards and tags, and one of the blue shades for everyday writing.The pens flow softly and smoothly, and have a really nice feel. I love colored pens. Gel pens? These new pens are excellent, and I'll tell you why: they dry almost immediately. I love to write with these pens smooth like silk and the colors are pretty, vibrant and dark enough to read, not like others I definitely will buy them again. I'd recommend these pens. What more can you say about pens? I've tried all the pens in the set, and each on the mechanism has gotten stuck, though a few more clicks did make it work.So, maybe not deserving of 4 stars, but 3 seems too few for pens that do write smoothly  and come in more unusual colors. I love these pens and certainly will purchase them again. I love using colorful pens, especially ones that retract like these do so there's no cap to lose, but these have a practical purpose too. I bought these pens because they were cheap and I liked the colors. These pens write smoothly and offer a nice selection of colors. I much prefer retractable pens because it's way too easy to lose the separate cap for a non-retractable. I gave these pens to my grandson who loves them. When I got these pens, I didn't know what to expect. Were they gel pens? I still wish the pens wrote immediately and consistently, though.Update, 2/20/13:  I don't recommend the pens. It takes cleaning just to be able to write with the pens, which seems like unnecessary aggravation. Apparently they are gel pens, and apparently gel pens have not come very far since the '90s. However, they aren't as wonderful as I had hoped, in that the pens make ink blots on the paper when writing. I've been using the pens for a couple of weeks now. You get eight pens of different colors - one each; Green, Cyan, Blue, Purple, Pink, Red, Orange, and Black. These pens would work great with a Spirograph. When I first received these pens, I thought they looked kind of cheap, but I was pleasantly surprised when I used them. These pens are awesome for all the writing I do. The pens are light, but because they are cheaply manufactured (very breakable if you step on them lightly); the internal ink reservoir and its sphere are nothing but a regular, cheap refill, which you can get for little money.Perhaps I'm not getting it? These pens are great for work--I use them at the library desk all the time. No more shaking and testing out pens that have run dry. The pens worked on both. The pens had a soft grip on the end. I'm going to enjoy using these pens. The pens write well and they don't leave ink blots on the page. The pens are a bit thicker in width than I like but that's a person preference and doesn't affect the quailty. When the pens that work right do, their lines are thin, faint, and occasionally spotty. These pens would make a fantastic addition to anyone's everyday writing implements. The pens do indeed write very smoothly and easily. I like retractable pens, too, because it's too easy to lose tops off of pens.I would probably buy them if I needed colorful pens. I like these pens. I have tried all eight pens, and they all work well. I have found, however, these pens to be inconsistent. Some pens in the package will be smooth and give a clear line with a smooth and flowing feel to the writing. Other pens in the same package dry out after one or two uses. I will probably continue to buy these pens mostly because when they DO work, they are the best colored ink pens on the market. These pens are very colorful and writing with them is a pleasure. Overall, though, the pens are comfortable, easy to write with, and sturdy. These pens also seemed to respond to a delicate touch and were quick to start.My only wish is that the giant Paper Mate company make colored ball point pens that have points of varying sizes from thin .25mm to extra large (bigger than 1.5mm). These pens were cheap and appropriately priced. I'm not sure what to say about pens, in my estimation they either work or they don't. It is fine if you must have some pens in these colors. While all of them originally worked fine when I first received and tried them, now the Green and Turquoise pens won't open when the top of the pen is pressed down. I had seen the commercial for these pens, and was happy to have the opportunity to try them out. So I gave these pens 3 stars because the colors are great, they write just fine for the most part, and the price for this package is very attractive.However, I do have to say that they don't always start writing well immediately, and they occasionally leave a little blob of ink, which smears only slightly when I TRY to smear it.I wouldn't be able to give any ballpoint pen 5 stars. My favorite pens are gel pens and liquid ink pens. We all like the pens though my impression is a bit more exhuberant. These pens are great! All of the pens wrote right out of the box. Are they my favorite pens, no.Edit:  Everything above this was my original review, but here is my update. I hate these pens. I would give these pens zero stars if I could. good pens, easy to use, comfortable to write with for an excellent product and the price is reasonable and appreciated muchly These pens write very smoothly and the colors are great and vibrant. These are my go-to pens in my office desk for writing notes and making my lists. Not much to ask from pens. I like colorful pens. These pens are great colors, but they are all too light to read easily on white paper.
