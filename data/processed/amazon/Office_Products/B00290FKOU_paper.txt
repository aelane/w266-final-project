This notebook paper is a really great idea. This paper helps with both. The paper is easy to tear out as well. This looks like typical notbook paper, but with added small, vertical lines spaced far enough appart to help those leaning to write, good placement of letters and sizing. This paper is a perfect addition in her backpack this year. I'm enjoying this lined paper myself. This paper has bolder lines that I can easily keep track of. We'll definitely be sticking with this notebook paper until it becomes natural for him. I asked her if she liked plain paper better, or her regular notebook paper or this one and she said this one. If this were available as loose leaf paper it would be ideal for me. Mead suggests using this paper for math as well. Mead's RediSpace paper seems to hit a nice niche for young students who have trouble with regular lined paper. This notebook paper is nice to have around for children's homework. He has enjoyed using this paper as it helps reinforce the handwriting lessons he has a school, without being super obvious. She has been practicing though on normal paper to try to write her letters smaller.The recommended age says 1st grade and up. (she used white paper without lines) I gave her this paper and showed her the start and stop lines on the left and right sides and how she should skip a space between words and I sent her off on her way. The paper is thin, so definitely use pencil if using both sides, pen will bleed through, but what this is is standard lined paper, with clearly defined margins, and best of all, the feature that really helps is the very light marks on each line kind of like a sawtooth, so that you can space your letters appropriate to the single line space. The paper size and lines translate into regular loose leaf which is great. It seems to me that this would really help those moving onto paper with more normal line height but having trouble with the spacing. It is more expensive than normal paper, but special paper has a much smaller audience than regular paper. This paper works great for young children just learning how to write...Also works great for older children or anyone wanting to improve their writing.2 thumbs up! They complained somewhat about it being 'baby' paper, okay, I teach high school, but they used it anyway. The paper is lined with a green light on the left of the paper and a red light at the right margin. He is transitioning.He wrote on this paper. She has written on notebook paper at home, but it is usually quite sloppy. The Mead RediSpace Transitional NoteBook Paper is basically wide ruled paper with little vertical dashes to help kids properly space their letters.The notebook says it's for first graders, but I think this assertion is questionable. The Transitional NoteBook paper is wide ruled. I used this paper to help my four year old learn letter size and spacing. This paper really seemed to help her with both of those issues and has helped her make some significant improvement in her handwriting. I wish I had had this paper. The paper I am reviewing is for 1st grade and up. The paper has three holes and is easy to tear out without ripping. The RediSpace paper is awesome! This paper definitely forces kids to do that, as a form with blocks (instead of just space) forces adults to separate words and letters uniformly. She wrote more slowly than usual on the RediSpace paper, and seemed to find the vertical lines distracting. This paper makes her count the letters before beginning to write the word. I've noticed that she does that with college-ruled paper now, as well.I probably won't buy RediSpace paper again, because my daughter understands what I was trying to show her by using it. Nice paper and helpful lines, well bound, etc. I gave this paper to my 9-year-old to take to school because she had been having trouble with 3 digit times 2 digit numbers. Problem solved...this paper makes her line up her numbers. The paper is on the expensive side, but a single pack might be helpful in resolving spacing issues. I would not recommend this paper for a much younger student, because letters do need to be "regular" sized rather than enlarged for early writing. This lined paper is so cool for beginner writers. Slightly thicker paper would have been better; this is thin enough that it doesn't handle the kind of erasing typical of first graders and writing on both sides isn't terribly practical, even though the pages are printed on both sides. This is great transitional paper for helping kids learn to write neatly. The ReadiSpace paper has really helped my daughter with her fine motor skills. OK, it's just paper, but the spacing of the lines was perfect for my 3rd grade granddaughter. This paper (I checked out the Redispace Transitional Notebook Paper, 4 stage, 1st Grade and up) is just what "the handwriting doctor" ordered"! We gave this paper a try and I feel while some may like it others might fail to see what all the fuss is about.I thought the spacing was more suited towards 2nd graders and up and that is how it is marketed.
