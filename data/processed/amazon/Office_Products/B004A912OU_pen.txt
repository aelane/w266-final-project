And I cannot tell you how long the pen will last, not and get in a timely review.EDIT: I found a reason to deduct a star. The pen is too tall to fit securely in a standard shirt pocket. I took apart the pen to see the length of the ink tube. The pen assembled without the cap is 5.875" long and with the cap is a full 6". She says these are so good she forgets the pen is there. I think these will be my "workhorse" pen. This pen has a rough ridge there that irritates my middle finger, so I have to place my fingers a little farther up the pen and don't get the same control as holding it closer to the tip. This seems to be a pretty reliable pen; writes smoothly, does not "blob" ink, does not smudge and works well on various kinds of paper. My pen of choice remains the Staples Classic Grip roller ball retractable. Sure any pen will do when signing a receipt or other such drudgery, but a nice pen can be inspiring. This is very nice pen that makes writing and sketching more pleasurable. I am satisfied with this pen. I received the pen in red, blue and black. I don't love the pen. It's an OK pen, but not one I'd pay for.For starters, contrary to the claim, it WILL smear. I find the pen too slender for extended use (and I have fairly small hands.) The pen is a smooth writer. But they are not my ideal pen. The pen doesn't start writing when you do. My previous favorite pen for quite some time has been the Pilot G-02. The Uni-ball Jetstream pen's line is just as smooth and does not smear like the Pilot gel pen does. I did find that the red pen did not lay down as smooth, clear and solid a line as the blue and black pens did. The pen is a bit longer than most standard pens and the cap snaps on and off quite well (and attaches to the back end).Overall a nice pen, but I knocked two stars because this is not like any other rollerball pen I have ever used or owned. The pen shaft is too thin for me and I would often skip letters because it would pop out of fingers while writing. Well, I have to admit that describing what makes a good pen is a challenge. I much prefer a clickable pen because I tend to lose caps! It's not the best pen I've used, but it's the best one I currently have in the kitchen. The pen doesn't do well with dots. Need a pen? This pen isn't quite that good, but it does come in at a close second.Uni-ball claims "quick-drying ink that helps prevent smearing." This isn't my new favorite pen, but I do like it very much. I don't like my pen to feel flexible, especially as I'm using it, and these do. Not only did this pen not leak one drop of ink, explode, or otherwise damage my clothes; when I opened it and tested it on a piece of scrap paper, it wrote like a dream, perfect. I have longed searched for a comfortable, affordable pen. I'm always losing caps.- The pen doesn't seem smooth on the paper. I generally skeptical when I read that there is a smearless pen. Each pen has a soft texture black overlay, but a more conventional grip near the pen tip would make writing a bit more comfortable and improve the overall design. What do I look for in a pen?
