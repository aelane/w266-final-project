I got this to make "made by" labels for gifts I give (knitted and sewn) and I absolutely love it! I like that you can store up to 30 labels in the memory so that you do not have to keep reentering the same info over and over again.I am a home sewer and I love having the iron-on labels to use in the stuff I make. But, just so you know, these labels are a bit on the stiff side. You can purchase separate labels too. You can make labels on the fly and organize just about anything. If you don't plan to make as many labels as we do, then you will be delighted with the labels (as we are).Five stars for its performance making labels, minus one star for using underpowered AAA batteries and not including a power supply. It makes regular sticky labels too. I love labels and labeling things. I was able to start popping out usable labels on my first try. The labels cut off exactly where I want them too, without ragged or jagged ends. These are narrow, silky little labels that apply right away with heat. The Epson produces good clear labels --- has a lot of neat special symbols. I purchased some regular labels to go with it and like them. And these labels really stick. Epson's regular labels work great. Not only can you make sharp labels, but now you can add graphics and borders to make them eye-catching.After reading the instructions to become familiar with the interface, creating labels is so easy on the Epson Labelworks. The Labelworks can also print on regular labels, so don't feel like you're only limited to use iron-on labels with this kit.One usefulness I see for this kit is when I make handcrafted sewing items. I also purchased the regular labels for her cups etc. The Dymo created labels on hard plastic tape and we had to squeeze the handle very hard to emboss the plastic. It's completely silent to use, you can't hear it printing or cutting your labels. I was anxious to make some labels so I installed some AAA batteries. The labels have a slick, semi-glossy surface which irons on easily with a hot iron and adheres very well. These labels are flexible, too, so they aren't uncomfortable inside of your clothing. Certainly these labels are excellent for children's clothing, especially outer wear that has a tendency to get lost. These labels are machine washable and dry cleaning safe. The labels are soft enough to have some flexibility though stiff enough to retain their shape. The the labels can be ironed on in seconds.The only minus is that labels can't be ironed on on certain fabrics, so it's mainly limited to thin fabrics like t-shirts and jerseys.

I'll make labels for my (first) great grandson (soon)!

These labels you iron on directly.

Plus, you can buy regular labels and label your whole house with regular stick on labels.PROS:-Small, robust feel, and solid design.-Very ergonomic: you hold it, and with both hands you have access to all of the keys, no straining to reach for anything, or having to put it down.-Variety of label choices: glow in the dark!
