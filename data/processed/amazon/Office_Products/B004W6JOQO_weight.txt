It has good weight and is a bright white. I like the heavier weight (thickness) of 24 lb over the 20 lb one usually encounters when purchasing paper for their printer. The heavier weight and brighter white is ideal for anything that I wish to share with others, whereas I'll use a lighter and cheaper paper for draft and file copies. I do enjoy having the heavier weight, but feel I would like to save it for more important documents, spreadsheets and so on. The extra weight helps it feed consistently well through my printer. Good weight paper. weight costs as compared to this 24 lb., weight. It is lighter weight and brighter.

It is considered heavy weight at 24.

weight gives this paper a substantial, but not stiff feel.

It is 24 weight which makes the pages feel more substantial than the usual 20 weight pages.
