I had returned an Epson V500 scanner that pooped out on me after two scans, and decided to try this Canon scanner instead. But so far this scanner has been very good.The LiDE 700F is fairly small, so it will fit in a smaller area. It was very easy to install, and it scans much faster than my old scanner (a 7-year old HP Scanjet). This scanner works excellently and the software automatically posts a icon that can be used to either utilize the scanner or find any problems. The scanner can be used either flat or tipped on its side as it has a stand that keeps it in that position. It was the rare flatbed scanner that did not take up a lot of desk space, having the unusual vertical picture frame design. The 4670 was the only scanner I ever saw that was really good at these odd scanning situations. I think trying to use the scanner in a 'free-orientation, hand-held mode would be ill advised.- With the HP, you could see through the scanner to the object you were scanning (applicable only when used upside down or in free-orientation mode); the Canon does not have this feature.- Both have detachable light-source units which fit onto the scanning platen, allowing the light to be sent through a transparency to the scanning element. You could lift the scanner from its base and lay it on whatever you wanted to scan, viewing the "whatever" >>through the scanner&lt;&lt;. I know of no other scanner that offers this feature -- it is sorely missed (especially as stitching software makes large-area scans practical). )If I were buying an inexpensive scanner for a small office, I'd go with the Epson, as the Canon seems more-likely to be damaged by careless users -- especially by being knocked off the desk. There is merely good or bad scanner >>software&lt;&lt;."
