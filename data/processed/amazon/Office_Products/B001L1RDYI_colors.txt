The colors are useful because they help differentiate your folders. They are muted colors without being overwhelming bright or neon. The colors add a serene and calming tone to the center, helping to keep the students calm and relaxed as well. The colors are a nice muted pastel in blue, lavender, green, orange, and pink. It's also nice to have colors if you like to color code. The colors are nice and easy on the eyes. I'm not sure I'd pay extra just for the colors as they are the same quality as regular folders, but it might be worth it for the large tabs alone. I thought when I ordered these that I would like the soft muted colors but they turned out paler than I expected. I also wish that the colors were more vibrant.The larger tabs on these are nice if you have a lot to write on them.Overall, these are decent. I found the muted colors of the Smead SuperTab folders to be a pleasant relief from the saturated, sometimes almost fluorescent colors of other folder brands. I love the different colors so that I can code and organize with these folders. Pretty colors and nice quality make these fun to use.
