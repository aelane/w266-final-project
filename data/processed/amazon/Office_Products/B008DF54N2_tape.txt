This is WAY better than tape for labelling stuff. It peels off easier than tape, and it is highly visible. This tape is a pretty spring green color and you can write on it but it doesn't do the one thing tape is supposed to do, which is to stick. This tape is a handy new companion for students. They can use the tape to make notes in their books --- which therefore remain unmarked and resalable at far higher prices. The tape also works great for notes to attach to a computer screen edge, or on a dorm-room or suite door or entryway.Users can tear off the roll just enough to accomplish their goal --- less than an inch, or three inches. Waste not, want not.The tape represents a vast improvement over paste-it notes, which have only one stick place, and often fall off. Something to note is that when you're feeding the tape into the end, you'll need to feed more tape than you need, bend the tape to go through the opening, then re-roll the tape back onto the roll while holding the end in place. And, since it's a full tape, you can make any size label you want.Now, for what I didn't like...it was waaaay hard to write on this with a lot of different ballpoint pens. This tape works great for temporry jobs that you may have. The entire tape is fully adhesive and it actually works better than tape or other sticky labels. The tape is 1" wide in a 400-inch roll. I have used Scotch Post-it tape for years now. What I noticed immediately is that the "old" tape was 700 inches and this is 400 inches! It appears to be the same old Post-it tape that I came to depend on over the years except that it is green and since it is shorter, you'll need to go back for more sooner! If you are not familiar with Scotch Post-it tape and paper, this is a good way to start. This post-it tape is a perfect solution for labeling and comments that I want to remain attached, since the whole back surface is covered with adhesive (which can be removed later if you want). To get that tape off which is recessed down in the dispenser is a lesson in frustrationful packaging and ultimately wastes about 8-10" of the roll.Next, the "cutter" just doesn't cut clean. I find it sticks better than masking tape and is generally more fun. The tape strip is just right for quick labeling and won't flip up, tear or fall off like post-it notes sometimes do in high-traffic areas.It doesn't always tear neatly. This Post-It tape is inexpensive, doesn't take up as much space in the drawer as the p-touch, and is quick and easy to use. The tape came off the paper easily, but did transfer some of the ink writing from the paper onto the sticky back of the tape. This 1" wide tape is perfect for small notes or to use as labels. I really love this tape! This tape is great for labeling things for your kids also. If you need plasticized tape check out a Brother P-Touch machine. This tape is awesome because it is fully sticky (as opposed to a small band of adhesive), you can tear it to the size you need, and it is easy to remove if you need to change the label you created.In addition, I am a science teacher and sometimes I have the kids rotate around stations in the lab part of my room. I love using tape like this to make arrows; I put the tape directly on my lab tables and it makes it easy for the students to know which way to rotate. This is so much better than making masking tape arrows, like I used to, because this Post-It tape comes off cleanly and without any trouble whatsoever.These are only 2 of many uses- highly recommended! I love that this tape has an easily-removable adhesive ALL ACROSS THE BACK, unlike post-it notes that have a free edge. The tape stays where you want it to, but removes quickly with no residue. It's on a tape dispenser type roll, and allows you to tear of notes of any size. I used to use clear tape to label kitchen containers and would lose sight of my label. This is basically green tape that is easy to write on and can be easily moved. It's Post-it tape and it works! Leave the tape for adhesion and get this for labeling. This tape is really the answer to so many little jobs around the house. I don't know how long the tape will stay on the object but I assume quite some time. It's doubtful I will replace the tape I have now when, or if, it runs out. It unrolls just like tape and has a cutter edge, just like tape. It's as convenient as a tape dispenser. I love this handy little tape. You can write on it better than masking tape and it adheres more firmly than Post-it notes but can still be removed fairly easily. This tape is great for leaving quick reminders or notes. This tape is just right. This "Post-it" tape works exactly as suggested. (Mainly if scotch tape will stay on so will this) You do need anything special to write on it, a pen or sharpie will do just fine. Because I carry tape flags to highlight pages in documents, and also always have "traditional" Post-It pads with me, I am delighted to lighten my pockets by carrying this roll of Post-It material, which easily serves both functions. The 1-inch wide tape is wide enough to write in BIG letters and, unlike the standard cubes, I can create a custom label by cutting the Post-it tape to the length I desire. It's Post-It tape. tape. BEWARE - I would not recommend that the tape be used on valuable items, since Post-it warns that the adhesive may mark some surfaces or lift inks. The tape leaves behind no residue and fits perfectly along the outside border of the monitor. But the tape is pretty and functional if you use it on certain surfaces. Second, having had the tape only a short length of time, I cannot say whether it ages well. of the tape due to this problem.Bottom line: You probably don't NEED this tape for your household or office, but if you happen to buy a roll, I'm sure you will find many uses for it. I did not have to use tape or any other type of adhesive to get it to stick and I did not need any kind of adhesive remover to take it off. I like how you can roll out the tape to the length you want, then write a note and post it somewhere. It comes out like tape and rips very easily, allowing you to get as much, or as little, that you want. This is a thick tape that you can write on. The tape sticks to the plastic. The tape is too narrow to use for labeling storage boxes, and too green to label anything else unless it goes on the bottom, where it can't be seen. I was using tape before, but it's hard to get that off of containers once you're done. I absolutely love Post-it's new adhesive tape. It dispenses like tape and you can pull off as much or or little as you need without any effort. However, the full tape roll of post-it paper almost defeats the purpose of a post-it to me. I use this tape mostly for card making. When the tape first arrived, there was some thrill in trying it out.T
