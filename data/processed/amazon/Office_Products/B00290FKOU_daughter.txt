My daughter, a kindergartner, is currently learning how to write, space her words, and proper grammar in her classroom. My daughter numbers her pages on the bottom, not the top corner, so the logo in the center of the page is annoying. My daughter really likes RediSpace paper and finds it much easier to practice writing and math than when she uses traditional notebook paper. My daughter it in kindergarten and we use it for her daily homework regardless of whether it has to be turned it because it is good practice. My daughter loves to write in this notebook, but, she enjoys writing in every notebook I give her. I chose this to see if it would help my daughter learn to write her letters in a smaller size and also learn to put spaces between words. While my daughter won't be in first grade until Sept, I am still glad I tried this with her, and will do so again to practice later on. My daughter came back with a much neater and legible product. (my daughter used to cram words into the tiny margin to fit them on the line in the past.) My daughter certainly found it frustrating very quickly and wanted to go back to "regular paper." When my daughter was younger and having difficulty writing legibly and lining up math problems due to dysgraphia, it was suggested that we turn her normal lined paper on its side to give her columns to follow for math problems.
