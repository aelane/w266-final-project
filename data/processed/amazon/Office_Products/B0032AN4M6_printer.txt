I'd owned a very reliable Canon MultiPass Multifunction printer (the Fxx series) for a number of years. the printer is nice, it works great. This printer deserves all the praise it has been getting. This is my fourth printer and first Canon. For now,  I'll continue using this printer at home because of ease of use, wireless capability, and overall quality, but I'll be looking for a less ink hungry printer in the future. I believe Canon priced this printer fairly low knowing they will clean up in the sale of ink. Got my new printer in 2 days from Amazon. This is also known as a 4-in-1 printer, as it prints, scans, copies, and faxes. You do need to install the printer driver and turn on wireless printer connection on each PC, but the software installer takes care of that.8) Canon's software suite is just great, making scanning and printing very easy to carry out. I would recommend this little printer for home or office use. This Canon printer works great as well as looks great, its a bit slower than the HP but the quality is 100% better. Our last printer was an All in One. It was a terrible printer from day one. This is my third Canon printer for home use, over the course of many years. Also, the printer seems to "skip" lines resulting in blank horizontal bars on my page. This printer was designed for one purpose and one purpose only: to sell ridiculously overpriced ink. after the printer is done printing on one side of the paper, it flips the paper over automatically to print on the other side of the paper.- Automatic Double-Sided (or "Duplex") Scanning/CopyingScanning can be performed with the flatbed or the automatic document feeder (ADF). The printer uses the is the dye-based ink for printing photos and the pigment-based ink for printing text. Then I have to restart the printer which drains a bunch of ink as it cycles.Scanning works pretty well though. Comparing the Canon to the printer it replaces, an HP C7280, the Canon stars in good error handling and reporting. This makes the printer an even greater value. This is my first wi-fi printer, and it couldn't have went any easier. )- It was also easy to add the printer to my other computers scattered throughout my home, and I was able to print from them without any problems.Cons:- When initially printing after a reboot or long layoff, it takes around 10 seconds for the first printed page to be processed, which can be annoying. It's not huge, but it takes up the entire printer area in my computer hutch, so much so that I have to pull the printer out in order to use the sheet feeder.
