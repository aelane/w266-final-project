While the paper pro is nice looking, it is truly a basic 3-hole punch, and is best designed for home use, since it only accepts 12 sheets of paper at a time.The guide is not adjustable, and all paper must be aligned the way it is set up. This paper punch is pretty sturdy and well made.It has a 12 sheet capacity.No spills -uses a 3" door, so you needn't remove the back off spilling paper circles.The cutting dies are held firmly in place.Uses one stainless steel double-body torsion spring in the center.Handle locks down for storage.In my opinion, it's fulfills it's function very well. All the paper scraps get trapped in the bottom and there is a flap on the bottom you open up to dispose of them. Dumping the paper cutouts is as easy as opening the plastic bottom and giving it a good shake.This is a good choice for a basic but reliable home use 3-hole punch.Recommended!CFH It's very easy to use, and I appreciate the paper guide the ensures the holes are always at the same place on each sheet of paper.While it claims to work for 12 sheets at a time, I found that when I got to the 8-10 sheet range, some of the punches were a bit ragged rather than being a clean punch. This is a great three hole paper puncher! I happy to say I've had no paper jams with the Paper Pro.I home school my kids so I am using paper punches a lot and this one seems to fit the bill. Aligning paper just right is a snap with this punch. The paper guide and ruler are very easy to read and it's compact size makes it easy to store. If you are a casual paper puncher, this is a good unit to consider.This product is made in China. This is a good paper punch for home use, especially by kids. (1) It punches decently and (2) It contains the loose punched out paper.
