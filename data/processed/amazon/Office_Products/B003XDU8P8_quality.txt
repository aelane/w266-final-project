Epson has produced a high quality, low priced, and extremely capable home/office printing/scanning/copy/fax machine that apparently is much more economical in its inkjet usage. Print quality is good, about what I'd expect from any color inkjet printer, and print speed is pretty darn fast. Printing at high quality is slow, too slow for office work.For the price, great, and as at my home office for some things I take home it's fair, but I wouldn't use this as my main machine, but mostly because of the software programming issues, and poor ability to print envelopes without jamming. I expected the quality of the buttons to be slightly better. Print quality was comparable to other inkjet printers that I've used - nothing photo-quality, but taking into account the price of the unit, certainly acceptable. Print quality isn't high-endbut I'm not too picky usually since I seldom print pictures.I had trouble getting it set up to work with my wireless network andstill haven't resolved the problem. When it comes to printing quality, there really is no comparison. If you're looking for a high quality all-in-one for everyday home use, the Epson WorkForce 630 is highly recommended! Laser quality black text and high quality and high contrast photo/graphics6. I was amazed that such a quality printer with an included scanner and fax machine was available at such a low price. The quality is just as good.It was simple to install.

I chose the highest quality printing to print a photo of my dog on a chair and the result astounded me.
