These little tape dispensers are great. While the tape in this kit isn't the "invisible" tape, it can be made just about so, if you slap it on the paper, then rub it gently with your fingernail or a paper creaser.I like both versions of this product. No more fussing about how the tape won't cut properly, and no more me worrying about their fingers getting cut on the sharp part. The tape would also occasionally flip back inside the dispenser requiring me to open it up to reposition it properly.Another issue may be price. Well, it is just tape, you say...but when you are taping lots of holidays wrappings, these are great. These little tape strips make using Scotch Tape so much easier! No more fumbling with the tape dispenser while you're trying to keep the wrapping neatly on the package. These pop up tape pieces are a pleasure to use. And the tape remains invisible. The tape dispensing is quite nifty and works quite good. This pop-up tape multi-pack includes two handband dispensers, two deskgrip dispensers and a total ten tape refills which equals 750 strips of tape that are each about 2 inch long each. But it is convenient to have the tape already cut and easily accessible.I prefer the new deskgrip dispenser. I would probably like it more if the pre-cut tape pieces were a little bit smaller (I generally use pieces half the size, if I'm getting tape from a roll), but the ease of wrapping and taping with the Handband dispenser makes it hard to complain. It was also very handy for putting tape on my comic book bags as I didn't have to keep reaching for the tape when sealing up my bags.The table top pop up is great too, but I found the handheld dispenser much more useful. How incredibly convenient it is to have pre-cut tape strips available at your fingertips. The tape refills appear to be fairly priced, too. The tape is very good quality and adheres well (we've used it for wrapping gifts this season). Handy little tape dispensers with the hand-held wrist being the sturdiest & most likely the one that will be most used. )Overall I am impressed with these tape dispensers, the precut tape sections are just the right size for most of your taping needs and the dispensers hold each successive piece ready to go without missing a beat. The tape of course is hard to cut, sticks to itself and so on if you only have one hand, the dispenser even slides some times (must be strong tape). Once they're empty, they're useless.Obviously, the pop-up tape line is more expensive than rolls of tape, but if you are interested in a serious reduction in your wrapping time coupled with much neater-looking results, then it's a worthwhile investment. But if you don't use a heavy tape dispenser, and you actually have to pick up those light, plastic tape dispensers to tear off pieces while holding down wrapping paper with your elbow because you don't have any little elves to assist you in wrapping, then this product will definitely benefit you. this pop-up tape dispenser is genius! the tape refills allowed me to wrap 7 large gifts or 12 small gifts before running out. Not much else to say about tape. It's easy to pull the tape and in my experience, it never pulled out wrong. They hold one tape packet.The Table Topper-  Wow, does this thing suction to the table! The tape goes quickly, so if you have lots to wrap, you may want to consider cutting the tape into two pieces. The tape is rather long in length. This tape dispenser has pop-up pre-cut scotch tapes. Meanwhile, I hate digging off the tape once it accidentally gets re-taped to the roll. Both of them have two tape pads inside. They need tape put in them but it does come with 6 refills. These pop-up tape dispensers have made my Christmas holidays so much easier. Using the tape instead of my tongue was quicker and less hazardous to my health. Also the tape is clean, clear and adhesive, not dirty, yellowed and barely clinging. These pop-up tape dispensers make the old-fashioned Scotch Magic Tape Dispensers seem obsolete. I'm so used to wrestling with the tape-- holding my spot with one hand while finagling with the roll of tape and trying to cut off a piece with my free hand-- that I just learned to live with it and accepted that wrapping gifts would always be a pain in the rumpus.But along came these new Scotch Pop-Up products, and it was a different experience. You won't get to do away with regular tape altogether, because there wil be times when you need a smaller or longer piece of tape, but on the whole, this fits the bill really well. Sure, you can use a regular tape dispenser; and I still will, depending on the application. This pop-up tape dispenser with refills comes with two handband dispensers, two deskgrips, and six refills that each contain 75 2-inch pieces of tape.I like that the handband dispensers fit snugly around your hand or wrist, are adjustable, are easy to use, are refillable, and permit you to dispense pieces of tape with only one hand. I found that if I don't pull the tape out quickly, the suction never held (at least not on my counter or desk) and the deskgrip wound up hanging in mid-air by the tape. The pop-up tape dispensers along with my Scotch paper cutter have made gift wrapping so easy. Almost every Christmas, I manage to kick the tape dispenser under the couch or bed on accident and have to stop everything I'm doing to retrieve it. While tearing tape strips ahead of time can eliminate 95% of most gift-wrapping problems, it's just so much easier to use these dispensers. I have hadthe old tape dispenser for a long time, after all.This is a product that I as offered by the Vine program, and sodecided to mix it up and take my chances. No losing the tape under wrapping paperor cats were "helping" made a big difference.The tape was easily dispensed, the dispenser easily refilled.I hate to say it, but I do believe that my old green plaid sidedtape dispenser has been replaced for good. It does work well and it is easy to pull the tape out. I highly recommend the pop-up tape in either type and this set is a great way to get them both. The tape comes out nicely and the grip on the bottom keeps the dispenser from sliding around. Just when I thought tape couldn't be improved upon. It comes with enough tape to last through a typical holiday season with tape to spare. The tape included in this package won't disappoint you; the refills are quality Scotch Brand tape. Also the tape comes out readily. There's no more tangling up the tape. We'll use this tape system throughout the year too. I am always scrabbling around for the tape. It's so nice not having to chase down the tape dispenser anymore. These little tape dispensers are invaluable when wrapping gifts.The wrist strap is easy to use and you ALWAYS know where it is. Just make sure you pull the tape straight up or the dispenser will slide.The kit comes with refills so I imagine there's enough to make it through the holiday season. Because the tape can be stubborn about coming out, it helps to have the dispenser securely attached to my hand. Fix the stubborn tape issue, and I'll happily pay a premium for refills. I was skeptical about trying these tape dispensers but was pleasantly surprised when I did. the tape pieces require a bit more force to pull than regular tape so it was a bit hard for my kids to use it initially. Replacing the tape refills is very easily done by sliding one side of the dispenser face, inserting the refill, and sliding it back. The tape appears if not identical, very similar to Scotch's Gift Wrap tape which is a nice marriage between their magic tape and shiny cellophane tape. The pre-cut tape works well on small jobs or when wrapping small packages.Some pressure is required to open the handband dispenser. Since it is not stationary I found it easy to inadvertently dislodge when I pulled the tape out at an angle instead of straight up. This pop-up tape dispenser set is perfect for small tape projects, such as wrapping presents or quick tape needs. It is not clear "magic" tape; there is a texture to the tape itself. There is more than enough tape in this package of 2 wrist band tape dispensers, and 2 desktop tape dispensers. Then there are 6 other tape refills included.The tape is already loaded into the desktop tape dispensers, but you will need to put it into the wrist tape dispensers. I always seem to be needing tape for one thing or another.I have never used the desktop dispensers before, so I decided to put one of them next to my keyboard, on my desk.The desktop dispensers each use 2 refills, while the wristband dispenser uses only one refill.I like the configuration of this package. Pre-cut tape is a blessing when wrapping xmas presents. I got these tape dispensers as an easy solution for using tape day-to-day. The tape already comes in the package pre-cut and pops up as you remove each piece. I was very happy with these tape dispensers! The tape held well and I have no complaints! I like that the circular tape dispensers suction to a smooth surface. It made it nice since I always seem to lose my tape amongst the paper, bows, ribbons, and gift tags. These little tape dispensers are quite handy. The tape pads are easy to install - you just pop them into the dispenser and the tape sticks up out of the opening, almost like a box of tissues, you just pull off a tape piece and another one pops up for you. Due to a too-loose elastic and too-sticky tape, it was a painful experience which actually left bruises on my wrist bone.Just looking at this new kit brought that memory rushing back, and if it only included the wearable dispenser I would never have gotten it, but the round tabletop dispenser seemed like it might work very well for times when I don't have two hands to spare for tape dispensing.Funny thing is, I actually like this finger/wrist dispenser as well or better than the desktop one! This works well if you remember to lift the tape straight up very quickly, but allows the dispenser to slide if you pull even slightly sideways. A wearable "Handband" tape dispenser and a "Deskgrip" tape dispenser. You must pull straight up on the tape, or the dispenser will just move in the direction that you're pulling. When the tape runs out, it goes in the trash.Five stars for the Handband dispenser. The tape pops out perfectly every time and gives you the same size strip every time as well.Now the desk dispenser. The tape dispenser actually suction-cups itself to the table, which means that you don't have to worry about holding it down when you're grabbing tape, something that I thought I'd have to do. Just pull it and the tape comes right out.I'm very impressed with this pack - my ONLY complaint is that the desk dispensers are not refillable. These tape dispensers are perhaps intended for the "serious" wrapper - someone who feels naked without scissors in their hand and, uh, tape on their wrist. Firstly, I must say that the tape in these little dispensers is just fine. I told my 11-year-old to come and try and take the tape from my desk and he can't figure out how to get it off. He might eventually catch on but until then I might actually be able to find some tape next time I need it.While I did get this pack with the two handbands, two deskgrips and six refills through Vine I would have definitely bought this if I'd seen it on a shelf somewhere before then. Scotch tape is great the way it is on the traditional dispenser, but I have to say this is a great set of dispensers and extra tapes. They seem to stay put pretty well and the pre-cut tape size is perfect.The hand dispenser, however, seemed clever at first sight, but didn't work as well as I had hoped. No more screwing around with tape rolls or scissors - simply pop a refill in the wrist mounted dispenser, and wrap away. The tape is thicker than standard Scotch tape. But it turns out, after some more messing around with it, I got the tape packet inserted and sliding plastic cover thingy back on its track and it worked just fine. When using traditional tape, I usually pull off either too much or too little tape.

Finally got the tape in the right way (smashed the end of the first one with the *door*).

I like that the tape is precut into tabs, perfect for wrapping presents and even helpful at the library when covering books.

As far as the tape itself, I learned several years ago to only purchase the Scotch brand of tape.
