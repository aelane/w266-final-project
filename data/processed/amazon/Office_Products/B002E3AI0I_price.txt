So $23 is a steep price to pay.3) [update after a couple weeks of use] I found something strange when using this the other day. However, the price point may be a teensy bit high. For roughly the same price you could purchase the Kensington Wireless Presenter or a movie-quality replica of Thor's Mjolnir. As for the price being too high, I would probably pay upwards of $60 for it as it is well-built, powerful, and works as advertised. When I first saw the price on this unit, I was confused as to whether or not it was being bundled with actual presentation software but that is not the case. If that is what you want and the price is reasonable, it should serve you well.Pros:sturdy and ergonomicgood battery lifejust plug in and it worksstorage for presentationsbuttons feel goodCons:almost useless documentationweak laser pointerUSB drive must be ejected to use laser pointer I don't want to focus on price too much since that can always change and a review should be about the product, but before purchasing this model, the budget-conscious should consider whether it is worth it, or if they should just buy theKensington 33374 Wireless Presenter with Laser Pointer(especially given how cheap USB drives are now).As to the function of the pointer itself, I found it worked pretty well. The price is an absolute deal killer though....

The price point is significantly higher, so you should think about whether the convenience of the built-in memory is worth it.

There is just no getting around the price of this item.

A little expensive, but that's the price of good design and convenience.
