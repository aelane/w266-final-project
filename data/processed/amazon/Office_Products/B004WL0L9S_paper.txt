This is indeed paper. Just normal paper, prime shipping too! This paper is perfect for general household printing. Not too much else to say about plain paper but we go through quite a bit and the price was right. I like this paper. The paper is very white and smooth with a 92 brightness as well as being 20 pound weight. The paper runs through the printer quite well and I have had no paper jambs. Clean, white paper. The paper prints fine through my laser printer. This is great plain paper. It is white copy paper. White paper that doesn't get jammed in the printer. I use xerox paper and just wanted to try this one outits esentially the same thing so both got my 5 stars This paper is really superb. It's not the best paper but for day to day needs it can't be beat. It's paper, and it's cheap. I usually buy paper from Walmart but glad I bought this one. I have not opened it yet but I am confident it will perform like an all purpose printer paper. It's paper, it's white, it does not jamb in my machine, and the price is right. I would buy this paper again if it was still priced at under $6. Bright white paper at a very good price. I use this paper for my small business and have always been impressed with the quality of the paper and, most importantly, the price is right. If you need fancy paper, this works. This paper is fine for the price. I think this paper worked well as a generic paper for my printer, it is a little thin, but that's to be expected for the price. And the paper is decent enough for what we need to print. I do not use this paper for anything fancy, just need to print the occasional hard-copy of a document. This paper seems to do the trick just fine. It is good cheap paper that comes directly to my door with free shipping. The paper itself is great.

Overall this is decent paper, worth the price I paid at the time for it (around four dollars.)

It is clearly cheap rather than premium paper, but my needs for printer paper are so basic that it doesn't matter.

The paper works fine as long as you don't need it to last very long and you aren't trying to impress anyone.
