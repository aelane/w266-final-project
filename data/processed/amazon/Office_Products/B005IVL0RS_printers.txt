It stuns me that printers this good can be purchased at this price point: I remember spending five times this much for a simple B&W; laser printer back in the day.Ease of use is also excellent. We have like 4 older wired HP printers that are just unused carcasses gathering dust here and there around the house.But now we can sit anywhere within WiFi range, and print documents or scan images, and this unit responds quickly. I've had printers from all the major manufacturers, and at each exchange added things like the built-in scanning and copying features, and recently Ethernet and Wireless compatibility. I do not foresee any more HP printers in future--this one, or an eventual Epson successor, is the one for me! Just scan from the printers control panel, and you can scan to a Memory Card, your PC, your PC via PDF, or your PC via Email. Once you start the printers driver installation it walks you through every step.Copy and Scanning wise, this printer does a pretty descent wise in both. Seriously!I have several Epson printers and though I've been wowed by some of its predecessors, this one wowed me again. Since there are so many printers available, the critical question before buying one is not necessarily whether it works well, but whether the features it offers are the best match for your needs. The NX430 (and many other printers) will be more than adequate for home users, and maybe even small businesses, that want to make a few dozen copies a day, or print photos, or print out documents that aren't very long. I've had a fair few printers over the years, from each of the major brands, and never been terribly happy with them. Other printers usually copy too light, but the copying quality is very sharp and doesn't look much different from our standalone copier.Scanning - Scanning speed through the document feeder was not nearly as nice as my Fujitsu, but still very respectable for an All in One. It's incredible how cheap All-In-One printers are these days; I remember when a good AIO printer would run upwards of $500. I've had more than a few printers I couldn't say that about.For the money, you can't do much better, and my only suggestion would be to see if you can find a similar Epson at a good deal, and go for your best price unless you need every feature (all seem to use similar printing engines). Epson's printers also feature economy and fast-economy print modes that accelerate print speed and can save on ink costs, at the expense of print quality.The WorkForce 845 is nonconformist in one good way, shipping with Epson's extra-high-capacity cartridges (model 127), a 945-page black and 755-page cyan, magenta, and yellow. On most printers, that action transpires automatically when the user lifts the hood. There are only a few printers currently that feature Air Print.The print quality is exceptional and color photos on photo paper are very good.

Most printers come with "starter" ink packs which don't last long.

I own several Epson printers and I continue to be delighted with the quality and exceptional features of the WorkForce line.The Epson WorkForce 845 is a wireless, all-in-one that prints, scans, copies and faxes.

This is wonderful since I have seen many printers with the usb and memory card ports on the BACK of the machine - very inconvenient.
