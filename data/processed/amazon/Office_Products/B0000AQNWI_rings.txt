The rings are sturdy. The rings hold tight with no gaps. It also has large rounded rings that make it easy to add papers. The rings are a little hard to open and close and they are loud but they hold your papers securely in place. *Standard rings with serrated teeth; tend to misalign over time and snag paper. The rings come together completely; there are no gaps to allow sheets to become damaged when turning them. It has round rings with two levers on the ends to push for opening and closing. Also has easy to close and open rings in the center, which is sometimes a problem with binders. The rings in the binder don't close, so loose leaf paper takes on a whole different meaning. It's not much to look at.The O-shaped rings are on the back inside cover instead of the spine, so your paper are less likely to get bent. The rings on this binder close super tight and pages don't get caught on them while being turned. The rings are somewhat easy to open and close for me, but it does take two hands.

the rings open up too easily an then after not long, they don't even close correctly.

It is sturdy, yet flexible, and the three rings open and close without difficulty.

It has decent rings which open and snap shut OK, and it feels like it won't immediately fall apart.Beyond that, it's a binder.
