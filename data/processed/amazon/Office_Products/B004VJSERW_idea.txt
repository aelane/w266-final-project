What a neat idea! I think the idea is great! I think it's a great idea that will catch on. Great idea. However, as good as the idea might seem, the execution of the product is the problem.+Positives++ Great for marking large sections of texts and notating.+ Do not need to mark in text-books, so they can be sold for more $+ Great for library/borrowed books because you can make notations and easily pull out notes before returning-Negatives--Difficult to write on. This is a great idea -- these Post-It Notes are see-through, so you can put them onto a document and write on them, without covering the original text. I'm not completely sold on the whole idea of NEEDING to see through my post-it, but they work good around the house. I really like the idea, though, and with a bit of work I can see it being used fairly often, especially in situations where extensive notes need to be made, but you don't want to write directly on the original. This is such a good idea that you have to wonder why it took more than 30 years after the introduction of Post-It Notes to come up with it.See-Through sticky notes are perfect for folks who need to make notations in books or documents, but don't want to write on the actual page. The idea: These Avery Sticky Notes are suppose to be a convenient solution for reminders, notes, to-do lists, all those little things that help you stay organized. however...The idea is great and I wanted these to work, but they are very hrad to write on with some pens, and with others its not as dark as normal paper; making it harder to read; or find a pen that will write on them. This was a very clever idea but not really necessary if you ask me.I'd rather stick with the regular "paper" post-its. These are a great idea! Cool idea. This is a great idea and would definitely purchase again. This is a great idea!
