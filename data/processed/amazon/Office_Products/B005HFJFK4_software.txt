I like Canon software interface, but I end up using Photoshop anyways. HP software are nicer looking, but bugs me in some features. The software is simple to install and very user friendly. The software takes everything into account including driver updates when you install so the process becomes incredibly easy for an amateur like me. The software that comes with it for printing on CD's is wonderful.I scan directly to pdf to my computer. They always come bundled with huge software packages that contain all kinds of status monitors and "bloatware" that I don't want. The software and drivers were minimal and do not take up much space on my hard drive. I actually don't mind having the full software package on my computer. The Epson software provided with this printer installs spyware on your computer in the form of the Ask.com toolbar without your knowledge.A few days ago I found that the Ask toolbar had been installed on one of my systems at a time when no one was at work or using the computers. I chose to Keep Blocking the software. One of the included software programs formats text and pictures to fit on the CD's surface. OCR software (ABBYY FineReader) is included in the software package to convert scanned documents into editable text.
