We found that the boxes were very large (check dimensions information) and sometimes would have been too heavy to move if we filled them up. Assembling was not as easy as with other boxes--perhaps because of the narrow nature of these boxes. I selected these boxes to review for the few larger pieces we still had on display in the house and would want to protect quite securely. The boxes are strong and easy to assemble. They also can be used as stand-alone boxes if you don't have three super large things you need to box. You get 4 large boxes with this order, but you also get the box that the boxes come in as a bonus. These boxes are sturdy and great for packaging up art work, mirrors and other wall art that needs protection.Not only are they great for moving, but they are also great for just storing extra art work to keep it protected. These expensive boxes seem meant to hold heavy contents in long-term storage. What is great about these boxes is the fact that they are already labeled with "FRAGILE", "HANDLE WITH CARE" and most importantly "DO NOT LAY FLAT". These are great shipping boxes or boxes to use for when you are moving to protect fragile, flat items. These boxes come in a set of 4. The boxes are strong and durable and should do a good job protecting the contents if packaged correctly. It's easy to find boxes from all of my online orders that I get and other resources like that for moving or packing but hard to find, unusual shapes like pictures or mirrors can be hard to know exactly how to pack. There tend to be boxes hanging around for the taking for just about any item you can think of ... almost. These adjustable SmoothMove boxes are the perfect solution to those fragile moving woes. I had been looking for some very large boxes to ship fragile items in, including mirrors. While the boxes arrived quickly, I was very disappointed that they were folded in half for shipping, making them less sturdy. These boxes are very good and sturdy. Coincidentally, I found myself moving when these boxes came available on Vine, and I snapped them up! If you *can* find boxes, they are either too small or too big or the wrong shape for packing flat pieces like pictures and mirrors.I was extremely pleased at these boxes! THAT, these boxes do in a very ingenious way. Very sturdy boxes for stuff a few inches thick. These are really sturdy boxes. I was able to make boxes that accommodated a variety of thickness and shapes. These boxes are designated for pictures and mirrors and I used a few of them for some of my pictures but I also used them for other items in my basement for storage.They were just what I needed. These boxes are very thick and sturdy and provide a lot of protection to your pictures or mirrors during a move or even to ship. Comparatively, these boxes are about average. These Bankers Box SmoothMove Adjustable Picture/Mirror Boxes are four-piece boxes that you can use to conveniently store mirrors and pictures. These boxes are totally worth it. When I assembled one of the boxes I couldn't believe how huge it was. These boxes are perfect for the many pictures and paintings that had been left unprotected in the garage. I love to recycle, so I know that I will use these boxes for storage, too.I think these are a great product. Because the boxes are so sturdy, we're saving them in case we need to move any framed pieces/mirrors again! The boxes are easy to assemble, but could use a little packaging to keep the art/mirrors from shifting around in the boxes. These boxes saved the day, my pictures and old wall decor is secure until I decide what to do with them!! These boxes are great for safely packing my framed cross stitch projects. The boxes come folded across the middle of the 'solid' side which makes them kind of crinkle in that area when opened. These boxes did a great job of protecting my pictures, mirrors and some collectible comic books. These boxes, aside from the specialty shape/size for large pictures, are about typical of what I expect - similar to moving boxes from the big hardware stores or truck rental companies. I suppose the boxes could still be called 'Picture Box' since the TV's are just frame's of many pictures. These boxes are exactly what they are supposed to be,  strong boxes that are very simple to fold. I feel confident they are well protected by these boxes. The boxes are easy to unfold and use. These boxes are very sturdy and the house window was rather heavy. These boxes are large , but really only will fit one picture per box (given that you will need to bubble wrap or, as I did, wrap in towels. You can also use the boxes to store unframed pieces until you are ready to frame them. I am moving and I am glad to have these boxes. The Bankers Box SmoothMove Picture/Mirror boxes are sturdy and easy-to-use. These boxes are long, which is perfect for large pictures and mirrors that need to be packed or stored. I ordered these boxes for storing large drawings. I found the boxes a bit too large for my purposes, but the box they were packed in was perfect for me! These are great moving boxes! Long and thin, but still decently thick/deep for shadow boxes or multiple pictures/paintings/posters. I like that these are sturdy, well-made boxes, that protect well: still need to use bubble wrap or other packing materials, but I really like these boxes: I moved a bunch of items using theses recently, and was impressed not only with the quality of the boxes, but also with how much I could fit in them. If you shop around for boxes, you'll discover one thing real fast - they are darn expensive. I save all my Amazon boxes and cut them up for bend-proofing large envelopes and adding protection to corners or large and heavy items.The box these come in is also a handy storage or shipping box.As far as quality, these are single thickness corrugated boxes - the same as you'll find at a UPS store or office supply center. Inasmuch as these boxes are shipped, not only flattened, but also folded in half, I was a little concerned about their stiffness when unfolded. But if you're sliding boxes onto an irregular surface, or even just past each other in a stack, the seams have the potential to catch.A bit of packing tape over the seam solves the problem. These are good, sturdy boxes...not flimsy cardboard, but thick and made to take weight, moving around and a few dings. Other than that, these boxes are pretty much what you'd hope for! We were hoping that these boxes would be received before our upcoming household move. Although the boxes came with a center fold, careful packaging and moving made of this a non-issue. These boxes are perfect for that task.These come in a flat box and are east to put together. I am moving soon, so I needed some boxes to pack up my framed pictures and other art. The SmoothMove boxes are a good size, but have a lot of flaws. I prefer boxes to already be put together before I get them, so I can simply fold them open, tape the bottom, and that's it. The SmoothMove boxes were not so simple to assemble.You take two pieces of cardboard, awkwardly place them together (I needed somebody else to hold one piece, so it wouldn't fall), then tape up three sides. They're also really overpriced.If you don't want to pay $40 for a few boxes, go to liquor stores, restaurants, etc. These boxes are meant for moving or shipping framed pictures. I accepted boxes for review, forgetting that boxes aren't really the easiest thing to write about. With boxes, you hopefully don't notice them, since anything you would notice would probably be a bad thing.Boxes in general are expensive, but the price for these seems reasonable. These are well made boxes! I was very happy to get these boxes because we have several different pictures/paintings that we use only seasonally in our house and when we're not using them they're just sitting in the basement leaning against the wall or stacked up on top of some storage containers. On these boxes I think I did not read the instructions very well, because I was shocked at the size of the boxes. the boxes are good merchandise, but are big. They are very sturdy boxes and can see getting a lot of use out of them.I don't think the price for the boxes is at all unreasonable. And those boxes weren't as nice as these ones. They are good boxes that will last. These are such great boxes, not just for moving but for storing as well. These boxes keep, all except the largest away and neat and protected.

These boxes really came in handy when I packed up the house that was filled with pictures.

These boxes are about as large as I would ever need to ship my art work, and are very sturdy, except for the fact that they come doubled for shipping to you, which creates a fold in the middle of each box.

You just use the boxes to make one large box.
