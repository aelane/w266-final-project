The area for the larger is now large enough I don't have to bend part of the label to the back side of the tab. The tab area is 90% larger than standard folders and is one of my favorite improvements. The label area is much larger as well which gives more space in which to write. It has a larger than normal area for labels. Plus the larger tab area allows more details on folder contents. They are sturdy and can be re-used, and the tab area is generous, allowing the user to write notes, and not just one line, in that space. The extra-large label area may not be much of a blessing. I like the larger label area, and the four different colors of folders will help save me time when I am filing or retrieving files that I need. If you measure the tab area  of the Super Tab files without any paper in the folder, the useable tab space measures 4 inches wide by 2-7/8 inches high. The extra area is not made by making the tab taller, but by cutting down into the file area itself.

I think these may be heavy enough they can be reused.I also like the large area provided for labels.

It is double the area usually available.

The label area is just deeper, not longer.
