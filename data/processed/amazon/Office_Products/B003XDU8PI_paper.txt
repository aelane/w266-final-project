I don't like the front paper exit for printed materials, which requires extending a paper catcher, but that's a small complaint.Overall, I'm stunned that this much performance and this many features can be packed into one unit at this price. It scans double sided if you so wish without having to take your paper out and turn it over. The paper path makes more sense and is less prone to jams. It also has an integrated paper holding tray (which means it doesn't stick out!!). It doesn't over saturate the paper with ink nor does the ink spread, smear, or fade, even right out of the printer. I like to keep regular paper in the first tray and photo paper in the second, but when I print with the SD card directly through the printer I have to put the photo paper in the top tray in order to print with it. Install paper, turn on. The upper paper feed conceals itself which is great for appearance and keeping dust out. The paper feed and output trays are cheaply made and I feel those need to be improved. Large paper tray, duplex, and huge ink cartridges (a godsend since ink seems to cost more than gold).

The paper tray slides completely into the unit which is nice.

When you are out of paper the screen says you are either out of paper or have a paper jam.

It's too bad their plain paper quality is acceptable at best.
