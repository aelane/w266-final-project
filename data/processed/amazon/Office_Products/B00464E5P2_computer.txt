If the computer does not auto-start the software, one has to open this new drive and manually run the program.What I like:- Rapid printing. It is convenient that you can plug it right into your computer and it is very stable standing up. After the computer "sees" the drive you either right click and selected open or double click on the DYMO software icon and it opens the app where you create and then print your labels from. If you have it already plugged into your computer, all you have to do is turn it on. This one requires a computer (laptop or PC, Windows or Mac compatible). All you have to do is hook it up to your computer and you are ready to go. You plug it into your computer's usb slot and boom, up and running in seconds. This Dymo is portable but you need a computer. You plug it into your computer. It's permanently attached to your computer (or I suppose a laptop) via a USB cable.You don't need any external software to get it to run. When you plug it in, your computer will see the program files on the unit. Also, if you're like me and you leave your computer on 24/7, unplug the Dymo LabelManager when it's not in use: The first day I had mine, I tried it out and then left the unit plugged in the USB port. I've turned the computer off and back on with the device plugged in and with the device unplugged at first and then plugged in, and I've searched online for drivers (which don't exist since it's PnP). I've changed where I plug it into my computer. The Dymo Labelmanager  Pnp is a computer printer of sorts. I plugged it into my almost new Hewlett Packard computer, followed the on-screen direction, but the software was impossible to open. Delving into my computer's help options I eventually saw a window telling me that the Dymo Label maker was incompatible with my computer.
