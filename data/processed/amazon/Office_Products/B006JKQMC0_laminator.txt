I once used a laminator multiple times per day in an office, and have really missed having the ability to make flimsy documents last longer, create a wipe-on/wipe-off chart for my small kids, or occasionally weatherproof a paper for use outside. I've never had another laminator, so I have nothing to compare this with. This has turned out to be a pretty good laminator that gets the job done. If you need a small laminator for home use this is a wonderful product. The laminator warms up in five minutes and it takes about 60 seconds to do a sheet with the hot feature. Discounted impressively here at Amazon, I expect this laminator to perform as well as the other Fellowes products I use and have come to rely on. You can certainly find a laminator that costs less or one that costs more. I had gotten this laminator to use work; previously I was bringing my Scotch Thermal from home, to print presentation cover sheets. Great little laminator. I've been using a Royal Sovereign laminator for the last 20 years and while it's worked ok I was happy to replace it. This laminator is suitable for a SOHO or social/charity organization. We both agree that this is an excellent laminator and highly recommend it. The laminator itself does not get very hot on the outside - just a little warm. I don't anticipate ever needing to buy another laminator. I highly recommend this laminator. This is a very stylish laminator. This laminator is first class, just be sure to look on the specs of the size. This laminator laminates up to 5 ml thick and heats up in 5 minutes. This is a good laminator. Trust me, this is not the laminator you'll find at 'big box' stores.
