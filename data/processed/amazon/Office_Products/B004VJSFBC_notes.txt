These sticky notes work well enough. These new preforated notes are very handy. Being lined makes your notes more uniformed and easier to make sense of. I am going to officially replace all my sticky notes with these perforated ones. These are sticky notes that are perforated so that you can remove the note and leave the sticky part behind.They do work as you would expect and that is fine as far as it goes, but the sticky part is left behind stuck to something. I wouldn't use them for the non-sticky notes, but for regular sticky notes I would. I think I'd rather have more sticky notes (like come in the regular products) than have a perforation so you can tear off the sticky portion. I love Avery's perforated sticky notes. Sticky notes have become a staple for notepads in offices and homes and how many times have you jotted something down only to have the note stick in the wrong place when you wanted to take it and use it as a list? Avery sticky notes come in a variety of colors including yellow, green and pink. Avery perforated sticky notes confuse me. These sticky notes are handy if you want to remind yourself of something important. I love sticky notes. I like Avery sticky notes, so I'm giving this product a good review. Perforated sticky notes--what a great idea! I have tried out the new perforated sticky notes from Post-it. Otherwise, perfectly good sticky notes.
