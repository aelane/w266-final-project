This light is the ticket when you want nice, stylish, bright light for your work, that DOESN'T just scream &#34;bug light&#34; like some LED lamps tend to do. Its not so attractive as a general light because of its blue cast. This light is heavy and has a good center of gravity. Other than that it is a good light and doesn't take up much room. It has a soft, gentle light that does not blind you while it is on. Its polarized light makes it so easy to read; everything is crisp and clear. The light is truly amazing with the anti-glare. This LED produces light that is perhaps a touch colder (blue) than sunlight. This light has been very useful on my desk. I have found that I prefer to have a light on even in daylight. If you only want to use this light for reading, I caution eye strain. to set the light to five different strengths that go from 90 LUX to 880 LUX. I like level 4 at 650 LUX the best for working and reading by this light. It is not soft light but hard almost florescent type lighting.Another problem is that the black frame for the lamp attracts all manner of dust particles. The light it casts is soft and there's definitely some glare reduction when used as a reading lamp. And I don't know how else to say it than that the polarized light makes reading my books and magazines and bills a more pleasant experience. Nice and easy to use, just touch one of 5 light options to get the brightness you want. Adjusts up and down, and the top light piece will swivel to get you just the correct angle you need. Polarized LED light is glare free and touch controls with 5 levels of light is nice. The LED light source can go up a proportion so that the light can be visible on most work areas. The light does reduce glare and intensifies colors.Unfortunately, I'm simply not a fan of LED lights. The light is too harsh.
