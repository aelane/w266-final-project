The tabs also have a laminate on them (both sides). This one came with 5 tabs, but you can always add more.... I tried writing on the tabs with a Sharpie, a ballpoint pen and a pencil, and none of them could be erased. One can write on the tabs with a pencil but a grayish smear is left upon erasure. The tabs are covered with the same reinforcement folded over, so it's a little more sturdy. I haven't tried writing on / erasing the tabs, but I'd guess that would work just fine, as long as you didn't do it too often. The tabs are easy to write on and see. As for the erasable tabs, extensive testing with all sorts of writing utensils didn't support the claim. We ended up with smudged tabs and less-distinct labeling, but were unable to find anything that would actually erase from the tabs.On the other hand, if you like the designs, they're inexpensive and they work just fine as dividers. The tabs are covered with a sort of plastic, like a layer of scotch tape.

The tabs are erasable and can be utilized again and again.

The tabs are a bit gimmicky and their least impressive feature.

Some of the tabs are patterned and dark so a printed label might be preferable to a handwritten one.
