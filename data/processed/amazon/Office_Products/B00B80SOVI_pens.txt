These are not as good pens as Sakura made pens, but I was hoping they were good for the price. Do these pens arrive like that? I wish there were a few more black pens (I only got 6) and fewer brown pens (I have at least 10+ of those), but I guess I can't complain.The approximate numbers above does lead me into one semi-major complaint: I'm a little irked that the pen color isn't written on the pen anywhere. The pens are good quality, easy to use, and once dry, the ink really is waterproof. Apparently, gel pens are the "in thing" for a certain range of kids - particularly girls from around age 6 to somewhere in the teen range (at least around our neighborhood). The pens write smoothly with no dragging, ink splotches, or mess.The stand I'm a little less enamored with. I love these pens. These pens offer great coverage without any light spots when using. The pens are comfortable to hold as each pen has its own special grip.The caddy is nice to keep them organized and stored. I would imagine Amazon might have it with Fountain pens, and last time I was shopping paper, in the local art center they had some porous paper for block printing for those who can't wait for the ink to dry.Some Notes;The mix was fairly equal with 38 regular gel ink pens, 32 metallic and 30 glitter pens. They could have also better labeled the pens. So while you're getting 100 pens, you're only truly getting about 40-45 colors. It's also hard to put the pens back in the slot if you're not standing over the stand, because the holes are so hard to see and are obstructed by the 99 other pens around it. These pens are also super inky, which is annoying as a left-hander because I inevitably end up smearing ink all over the paper and end up with sparkly/glittery ink on the side of my hand. I guess I'm just more used to writing with pens that have a 0.7 or 0.5mm tip, which allows more precise penmanship, but when using these pens I have to write pretty large and fat letters so it doesn't look like a blob of ink. However, the pens do write smoothly though there are some instances of the pens' inconsistency where the ink skips a beat or two and I end up with incomplete lines.I think these pens are fun, if not only for the nostalgia of childhood, and there are enough colors to please, though there are far too many duplicate colors. They are smooth, they do not clog -- yes, you heard me right, these are gel pens with NO clogging. I love pens and almost all types of writing implements and I have since I was a kid. I didn't realize until I got the pens that they also vary by tip size, which is nice. *  The pens write very nicely--they are comfortable (there is a small grip pad) and write very smoothly. Not having the pens numbered also means that it's impossible to order specific refills. *  These pens, like all gel pens, smear on a coated surface. If the pens last a long time I'll be very pleased. Overall, these pens are well worth the price. So many pens that we will probably never use them all, but that's all right. The pens stay in the base well when you spin it. When I ordered the pens, I was literally salivating at the thought of having 100 gel pens, all in different colors, on a rotating stand, and ran to the door when the UPS dude brought me the package today.The package did not disappoint. The pens are not arranged in the stand as you see them, but you get them in a plastic bag and it's rather enjoyable (if you are me) to arrange them, check out all the colors, and put them in the stand. )IF YOU ARE OLDER THAN THIRTEEN: These pens have archival quality, acid-free ink. And, the pens write and draw well. That would have made distributing the pens on the stand by color much easier. I love the pens and all the different colors they come in. These pens are great and I love all the colors. I like these pens, especially the ones with glitter, followed by the metallics. I love gel pens. The pens come in three main types, and are coded so you can find the ones you want from seeing the color-coded part of the cap:* Gel pens have clear tops with glitter embedded in them (and also in the grip and pen chamber)* Metallic pens have a metallic tone to the colored area of the cap (this metallic tone is also on the grip)* Plain pens have opaque tops with plain colorsThe pens don't come set in the case; I placed them in chromatically, darker shades near the top, lighter at the bottom, with each color on all four levels.
