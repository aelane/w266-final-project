This is a new printer; turns out the CD had the latest version built in. Remember this printer Faxes, Scans, does OCR (Optical Character Recognition), prints, and prints two sides. This is an inexpensive printer to run, the ink is reasonably priced.I really love this printer. Worst printer I have ever owned. I will never buy an HP printer again. Since the printer was basically next to my desk anyway, we just used a USB cable. It was the printer head issue. Even though this printer has more capabilities than most of the printers I've owned, it's probably been the most frustrating one that I've owned for a number of reasons.o It's a bear to use. My next printer will probably be a Canon. I should have done that long ago anyway, but the printer is supposed to be able to use WEP and simply couldn't on my network despite no problem with any other hardware. The printer wouldn't shut down, wouldn't advance the paper, wouldn't cancel the print job. I love the printer but have a lot of trouble with the wireless feature. Good printer, but I was on the phone with HP for over an hour, that was a little excessive.

If you're looking for a printer with all the latest technologies, check out the HP Officejet 6500 Wireless.

For a printer in this price range, HP should have included a 2.5" color LCD screen.

This is a remarkable printer, solid, well built, relatively easy to install, and fast.
