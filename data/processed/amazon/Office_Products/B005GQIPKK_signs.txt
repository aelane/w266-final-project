I assumed I could make signs that could be removed and reused. I have created signs for my window and she like them for a great assortment of signs, notices, instructions, teaching aids etc. I think if the signs are going to be temporary, it's worth using these labels instead of having them custom printed. The signs are attractive and are easily put up onto windows or walls with either a removable backing or front facing adhesive. Moreover, since the the signs are not reusable you will have to print a whole new one every time you want to advertise a special event or sale which means lost productivity. So I think that I will use these for signs that we do not want to remove as it looks more professional than the clear pockets or tape. I like the Avery Removable Window and Wall Signage because you can actually print two signs from each of the 10 sheets included in the package. However, both signs need to be printed before separating them, since they couldn't go through the printer individually due to the respective adhesive and slick sides. I paste it to foamcore for small signs. If you need signs for windows or smooth surfaces this is great -- did not hang as well on painted textured wall surface.These signs are "temporary" on nature and I would expect that they last only a few months at max before starting to loose their look. == the signs are opaque not translucent like a window cling.I'm planing on using more of these to post signs in the clinic where I work that are promoting various health promotions or reminders. It almost appears that the signs are actually painted into the wall instead of applied. These signs are great for small business.
