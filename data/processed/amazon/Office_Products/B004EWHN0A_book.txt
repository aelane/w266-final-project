I would recommend this book to parents who home school or want to add a little extra learning to their child's curriculum or for use over the summer months. As you move through the book, there is a progression to harder material (for example, more logic puzzles) so if your child has mastered the easier concepts, flip through to some further in the book. What a great book to have at home or at grandma's house. I highly recommend this book. I got this book and the Kindergarten version through Amazon Vine for my grandchildren. The book are very colorful and have a lot visual interest. Throughout the entire book there is also exposure to letters (capital and lower case) and numbers,as well as, common sight words.I would suggest that the book is for the child who is the middle learning tract. Second, this book teaches skills that will come in very handy when my boy takes the OLSAT test, or any other aptitude test. I asked him how much he liked the book and his response was "I am having a hard time putting it down." I was unsure what I should expect from this Problem Solving book by Mead. The book has bright and colorful illustrations that will catch the attention of young learners.Overall I think this workbook is worth considering if you're looking for a book of logic based activities for your first grader. This book is colorful & inviting for any 5-6 year old. This book has some good skill review activities for 1st graders. This book is focused on building critical thinking skills and problem solving. The book is also very appealing to kids, my son will sit with this book for long stretches of time. She enjoys the book and I would buy similar products. I think the book doesn't have much to it for the price. I didn't realize when I tried out this book that it is specific to "Problem Solving". When I got the book I was pleasantly surprised. The book is small, so the price for the book is quite high. In this particular book there is 96 pages. The book also has a broad level of work in it which focuses on easier problems to more difficult problems as the book progresses. Before I come across as being critical, I have to say that this book is REALLY good. Got this book for the 1st grader I babysit after school three days a week and he has not stopped using it since it arrived. It's a skinny little book, but he's found lots of things to do in it for the past two weeks. Highly recommend this little book. The book is designed to teach an overall critical thinking basis rather than pound in repeated memorization exercises.This workbook has been a wonderful way to pass the time.

He sat right down and got to work, and became absorbed by the book for about an hour straight!

He really loves this book, which is great news for a couple reasons.First, I don't like to plop him in front of a screen, so any written materials that occupy him while I get some work done are gold.
