I wasn't sure what to expect from this dispenser. This dispenser is perfect for the every day tape tasks. I recommend this dispenser. This dispenser works fine and if you need pre-cut pieces of tape, this is for you. The dispenser adheres via a rubber bottom to any smooth surface. The dispenser is colorful and adheres fairly well. The dispenser comes with ONE 75-strip pad. Other than that, the dispenser works exactly as promised. The dispenser has turned out to be very handy on my desk. The dispenser has a larger footprint than I imagined and the "gripper" leaves a lot to be desired. even though this dispenser is available, when I do need some tape, I habitually reach for the more traditional Scotch Tape dispenser just because I'm used to it. Not a bad looking dispenser;2. When I first saw the dispenser I didn't think too much of it, but once I set it on my desk, I realized the true greatness of the product. The dispenser worked fine and was easy to load, I've not checked on the cost of refills yet, but I hardly think it will be too much to bother me.The base of the unit is non-slip, so you can put it on something and it will not slide when you use it. Understanding that......this handy dandy dispenser doesn't totally replace a normal roll of tape (for when you need more or less then the two-inch pieces that this item provides)......the unique and effective suction-y backing doesn't stop you from sliding the dispenser side-to-side (just pull the tape straight up! If I want to move the dispenser, I can simply slide it to where I want it, or easily lift it and place it somewhere else. The dispenser will adhere vertically through suction on a table top, but it easily slides across the table if horizontal force is inadvertently delivered to the dispenser. You don't even have to look at the dispenser to get your piece of tape. I really liked this little dispenser in some ways; it's cute (for a plastic product) and doesn't stick up too high. The dispenser sticks easily to most clean flat surfaces, and yet it remains free to move horizontally. Third, it comes in a handy pop-up dispenser equipped with a no-slip pad that actually acts as a suction cup on smooth, flat surfaces. I was hoping to use this as a dispenser of tape for those times when I just need a little piece and don't want to mess with the big, heavy desk dispenser. The dispenser stuck where I put it the whole time and came off easily when I was done!My only complaint is that I wish there were more strips of tape in a refill but still, I'll buy them. This is a handy little pop-up dispenser for your desk. They are refillable so if you run out, you don't have to remove the dispenser and can just refill it. First, the dispenser has a suction-cup bottom that sticks surprisingly well on a wide variety of flat surfaces. This is a nifty little dispenser which prevents that very problem. Then it dawned on me: the dispenser may hold less, but since the pieces are perfectly sized for most projects we're actually using -- and wasting -- less.We'll probably stick with this, at least for our gift-wrapping and art projects. This little dispenser solves that issue - as long as you are smart enough to have it around before you need it! I like this dispenser because it is so convenient. But, again, my weighted dispenser would be my preferred choice for this project.--I would recommend the pop-up dispenser for those who don't want to take up space with the larger, weighted type dispenser and who want something you can use with one hand.--I would also recommend this for travel. It is a small and well-made dispenser designed to dispense little strips of tape. The dispenser is round and fairly flat and has a special suction cup on the bottom that sticks to any flat, horizontal surface but is easily removed.We go through a lot of tape so this is helpful in saving the tape that would be wasted with the younger kids. Once the dispenser has been placed on a smooth surface like on a desktop or counter, the gasket does create a simple seal that makes picking the dispenser up very difficult. However, sliding the dispenser around is effortless, so placing the dispenser near the edge of the desk can prove frustrating if you slide it right off the end of the desk...Because of the mounting, tape must be pulled straight up from the dispenser, not at an angle. Now, I'm not sure I can go back to the old dispenser! The dispenser provides a good grip to any surface, so it will not move when grabbing pieces of tape. I will continue to use the normal dispenser because it does not take that much longer to use. It's much better than having a large 'classic' dispenser on your desk, or having just a basic dispenser thrown in a draw to get lost or hidden. While the dispenser does cling to most surfaces, it also scoots around and tries to get away from you. The pop-up dispenser gives you a section of tape exactly the right size with only one hand needed to pull it off.The only thing I didn't like about the original version, in fact, was the wristband. I would never wear the dispenser and instead just set it on the table. It's plastic, so probably not the most durable dispenser on the market. The dispenser itself works like a charm on any smooth surface, which allows the user to securely apply it to wherever they happen to be working at the moment without having to worry about the sticky residue associated with many other adhesives. It keeps the dispenser from pulling off the table with the tape, but allows it to slide around horizontally like a hockey puck. I really love this dispenser and wouldn't want to go back to old Bessy. You simply set the dispenser down and give it a gentle press. The dispenser is shaped so that it can be gripped with ease. The dispenser has a strong grip, looks cute, is easy to use, and the improved adhesive tapes pop up perfectly. And if your dispenser is worn like mine, you unintentionally often get strips as long as the package.The tape is simple to load into this dispenser and works flawlessly. Then I discovered the dispenser's value to me as a musician frequently required to assemble 10-12 sheets of music manuscript paper into an accordion-style "score." The old dispenser gets crushed when I close the drawer, the tape gets grit and dust on it, and the tape gets off the cutting edge and then is immpossible to scratch from the roll. I already had a dispenser for the pre-cut tape, but this new dispenser is pretty neat. If you hold the dispenser a foot above a smooth, clean surface and gently drop it - it's gripping. The dispenser takes up about 1/2 the room on a desk as a conventional tape dispenser. Tape dispenser can get very annoying and hard to manage. It's so small though, it's easy to overlook inside the dispenser. Also, since this dispenser has a suction pad that sticks to the desk, to remove it you either have to slide if off the edge of the desk or else give a tug to lift it straight up, neither of which is convenient.Finally, this product is way too expensive for the amount of tape that you get.Bottom line: I can understand why young children would like this, as another reviewer has noted. When I first saw the Scotch Pop-up Tape dispenser I was a bit skeptical, but after trying it out, I'm quite impressed! This pop-up dispenser from Scotch is fabulous! The dispenser is refillable and does grip nicely on the surface of whatever you have set it on, like the desk or the table or even the floor (depends on where you do your gift wrapping). The dispenser itself is almost $5, and the refills are almost $3 a pop. The dispenser is easy to load and the tape is truly invisible when applied. The Deskgrip dispenser does away with all of that. Because it was new, the Deskgrip dispenser took me a few minutes to load. The dispenser provides one strip when the user pushes a single button, so it is perfect for one handed operation.

It is the dispenser.

The dispenser is basically a plastic disc, a little over 3 inches in diameter and about an inch high, with the tape sticking out of the top.

This dispenser improves on a couple of features and makes getting small pieces of tape easier than ever.
