"I have read that ink for this printer is expensive, although you're provided with your initial cartridges and even some paper. It wasn't just dropping some ink cartridges in, and plug it in, after loading the CD and go. I guess they prefer to have the ink get used up on being able to print the incoming only.Anyhow, the print quality is very nice. But you also need an ink model for producing color, and color photographs, as well as in this case having the scanning, copying function, as well as fax built in.If you are a home operated business, or have an office in need of a good printer for mild to moderate printing needs then this Epson is a nice quiet unit to have. It's quick, easy on ink and very stable (no issues for months of it being constantly on). The ink. I mostly print black and white, so I was glad to see that there is a separate black ink cartridge available for purchase. I would be onto my 3rd ink cartridge if I was using the HP printer this printer replaced.The copy function is confusing. The ink cartridges are separate (black and three colors) instead of relying on a single one to provide all colors. The ink cartridges were all color coded and seemed to be specially grooved so that if was unable to match the color to the correct slot the cartridges would not fit into slots they were not supposed to be put in. I have only recently replaced the black ink, which is giving me a much better value for ink than my previous printer which I had to change the ink monthly.All in all, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this printer! I hoped for less ink cost overall and great quality printing. I have been refilling ink cartridges for my inkjet printers (Canon, HP, Brothers) for 9 years to cut down printing cost. The ink cartridges come seperately for each color and black and white, which is good, you don't have to replace an entire cartridge just because the cyan is out for example.The device looks sleek and expensive. The ink jet is just not as sharp, and you should set your expectations accordingly.SCANNING:  For scanning I used the test page from my Fedora machine. I don't think it goes though any more ink than any other standard inkjet but, lots of printing means buying lots of expensive ink.I suppose you could use aftermarket brand inks, or get refills, but I have never been one to do that and I can't speak to how it would work.I did setup the printer to work via WiFi via a router to the computers in my office, took a little bit of time but it worked fine on all my computers. I'm not sure how fast I'll go through the ink but I'll report back and edit if I'm not happy with it. Individual ink cartridges (replace only the color you need replaced)7. Since it is the most used ink, it makes perfect sense that there should be more of it. *** The ink dries fast and doesn't curl the paper (we use 94% white, 24 lb stock). If I discover that the ink cartridges run out ridiculously fast, I will update this review to reflect that.I am stunned at how fast this thing prints!
