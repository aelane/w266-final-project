The front cover also allows for customization (by inserting a cover sheet). I LOVE this feature.Pockets- The front, back, and side have a clear cover for you to put in whatever you want-- the class syllabus, a spine title, etc. I was even able to fill the front and back pockets with some miscellaneous manuals that I was just storing on the floor.The one touch EZD ring is just that, easy.Couldn't ask for a better binder at this price. This includes the front clear window, and the inside pockets. And the front, back and side all allow for papers to be slid on the outside of the binder to create a cover and spine label. The front cover can hold a sheet to label the folder, as does the spine (although, the plastic on the spine is a little tight making insertion of a label a somewhat tedious process). It is see through on the front, binding and back and boasts a non-stick  material that prevents print transfter. The front, back and spine is covered with a clear plastic overlay, which is open at the top so the user can insert photos or otherwise personalize and label the binder.Inside the front and back covers, there are four vinyl pockets. The front cover and spine open and wrap around the back cover. The front and spine all allow for a slip-in presentation sheet; the back does not. Both the front and back panels are equipped with two pockets for holding loose items that are either not hole-punched or that don't fit in with everything else.
