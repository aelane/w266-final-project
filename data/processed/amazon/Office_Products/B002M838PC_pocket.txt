This is a thin pocket filer, made out of stiff plastic with ribs. This pocket filer is nicer than anything I've purchased to file papers at home. I have to admit I chose this pocket filer because of the color. Like most pocket filers, the dividers do not extend all the way to the bottom, so you can lose any small pieces you store in this. We use the new pocket filer as a recipe file for magazine page and letter size recipes that do not fit well onto a 3x5 recipe card. This pocket filer is very sturdy and comes in an adorable pink. Great pocket filer, seems pretty durable (we'll see how it lasts) and it's really a fairly intense pink color (which I happen to like)...opens easily, closes securely, holds a decent amount of paperwork, organizes well, very lightweight. An individual pocket can spread to nearly an inch wide but in that case there is little room for contents in the other pockets. Each pocket has a label tab and this comes with colored paper inserts for these tabs.I am intending to use this to keep receipts for tax purposes during a year and then move them into that year's tax filing folder. This pocket filer worked great until it didn't...after about 3 uses I start noticing cracks in the outer shell.
