You get what you pay for and this provides quality at a reasonable price. This high quality 3 ring binder by Avery holds plenty of paperwork and has a unique "One Touch EZD" opener. I am very happy with the quality of Avery products. This is a high quality binder at a good price; if you need a binder of this  size, this would be a good choice. This is a great high quality binder that is easy to open thanks to the One-Touch ring opening mechanism (has a button on one end to pop the rings). The quality is always the best and the designs are a step ahead of the competition.We've also triedAvery Durable Vinyl View Binder, 11 x 8.5 Inch, 2 Inch Capacity, White (17032). The quality isn't as good. I plan to purchase several more to replace some of the lesser quality binders in my library. Avery has always proven to have quality binders, and we use a lot of them at our home. Great quality.

I think the most unique quality about this binder is that it is PVC free, which means that your photocopies and such aren't going to stick to the cover and peel off onto the binder like all of the other ones you have.Not included in this binder are the plastic "sheet lifters", which are the boomerang-type pieces of plastic that you use to push back all of the pages in the binder without ripping them out of their holes.

High quality, hasn't ripped after 3 months.

Strong, sturdy, and of better quality than the ones you can get for $1 at back to school sales....if you need something nicer, this is the way to go.
