The scanner is lightweight and attractive. The scanner also has easy quick buttons where you can send copies to a printer or scan them at email attachments to connect manually (say yahoo email) or use Outlook (I am using Windows 7).I for one found the software very user friendly. This scanner will be invaluable. Once connected, this little scanner heats up within a few seconds, scans really fast and the quality is superb. I am totally happy with my new  Canon scanner and paid well under a hundred bucks. I've also had a Canon USB scanner until recentlyCanon CanoScan D1250U2F USB Flatbed Scanner. And this scanner even works in vertical mode if space is an issue. This is an excellent scanner value. I use the scanner primarily for scanning receipts and it does a good job (minus the OCR). Highly recommend this scanner if you're just looking for basic scanner features. This is my 4th Canon scanner and I use them often. For me, this scanner took the place of an "all-in-one" that I was only keeping for the scanner function. Neither were as sleek or as well made as this scanner. I also use a scanner for photographs, but that is a rare use for me personally since I only do digital photography these days. If you just want a stable scanner that will get the job done with minimal fuss, this is a great choice. Great scanner. Canon CanoScan LiDE210 Color Image Scanner (4508B002) is the smallest, lightest scanner I have had to date. Good scanner for personal use. Great scanner for the money. This is a highly functional, USB powered scanner from Canon. I strongly recommend this scanner for your scanning needs.

If you try to scan with the scanner locked, it will tell you, "unlock me".

Clean the scanner frequently with a damp cloth.

This is my first Canon scanner.
