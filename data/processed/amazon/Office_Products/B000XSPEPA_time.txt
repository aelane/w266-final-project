I did not time myself but I think I wrapped at least 50% faster with the tape being inches away from my dominant hand and the gifts needing wrapping. It saves so much time and makes it all so easy. Most of the time it works fine. Most of the time, the flexibility of a standard roll of cheap tape is hard to beat, although it is nice that this product is harder to gum up, and easier to unclog than a roll of tape.As for the title of this review, my young children ran through most of a pad pulling tape strips and sticking them to their fingers and most everything else at hand. I would think this would be great at Christmas time for wrapping packages and the like. It was the first time I was really curious. This came at just the right time for me. I got this in time for holiday wrapping, and I put it to almost immediate use for wrapping a pile of last minute gifts for family members. And at this time of year, with all the holiday madness, a little convenience can make time intensive job just that much easier and faster. First, I had a really hard time opening the door to the dispenser. The first time I pulled out a piece of tape, I got two pieces. The first time I put the tape in it didn't come out properly. The second time it worked just fine. It doesn't save time and the popup tape is sticky on the top from the previous tape. Most of the time a regular roll of tap will do, and is cheaper. Got this just in time for wrapping holiday presents and we we'll now never be without one or two in the house. By the time you get most of the way through a big pile of presents, you will need a refill. It's a major time saver in that it keeps the tape easy to find and easy to reach at all times.The little strips of tape are about 2" long and by pulling one strip out you prep the next strip. My time IS worth a dollar extra to make those two hours easier. I was attracted to Scotch's Handband Dispenser from the first time I saw an ad, but couldn't justify the price when I had a roll of tape on hand.
