This printer literally sits on the same shelf as an Epson 3810 and Canon ip6600D. So, this printer is not THAT fast in my humble opinion.2. I was able to get the printer to work most of the time by reloading paper and/or pressing OK multiple times, but eventually the printer just refuses to feed paper from the letter-size tray at all.I should note, the paper is HP-brand, specifically for use with this printer.It's too bad, because otherwise the printer is great: fantastic print quality, outstanding speed, very easy setup for both Windows and Mac OS X. I looked extensively for a printer for our home office to replace the HP7660 that we sent off to our daughter's dorm room last month. The printer also uses a priming system for inks which is suppose to lower ink consumption. This only takes a second, and these are the most foolproof printer cartridges I have ever seen, but the printer does not tell you that the cartridges are not yet installed, at least not until you try to run the diagnostic. Further, this printer is very precise as to how it applies ink to a given paper type. Other than that it is a very nice printer that does beautiful pictures and is esy to use.

This is an excellent printer for the serious photographer.

This printer does the job.

When you first take the printer out of the box it will prompt you to put paper in the printer and let it test the ink cartridges.
