Although it will accept SOME stapled paper, it will not accept many tyes of fasteners, so please remove any and all metal or plastic from the paper before shredding it.The EX100-07 shreds automatically -- up to 100 sheets of standard sized paper. Compared to other paper shredders I'v used its faster, quiter and has a bigger capacity. Compared to a $40 paper shredder we have been using I find it only slightly better. Depending on the paper type/weight, I timed it at about 7 1/2 pages per minute. Both are great units.Epson WorkForce 840 Color Ink Jet Wireless All-in-One with Fax (C11CA97201)Epson WorkForce Pro WP-4540 Color Inkjet Wireless All-In-One with Fax and 580 Sheet Paper Capacity (C11CB32201)So if having a paper free office is your goal then this Swingline shredder will make shorter work of a huge backlog, and the Epson scanners will capture the documents into ad-infinitum, and if you want to be sure that your documents don't go up in smoke in a computer crash be sure to back up your data. However, the upper paper feed, which is intended for stapled/paper-clipped pages, unopened mail, credit cards, etc., doesn't work quite as well as I had hoped. It can shred paper, card stock, crumpled sheets, multiple folded sheets, and unopened junk mail - these are best shredded using the manual slot. Instead of having to constantly feed paper into the shredder, I can stack the paper, push a button, and walk away as the shredder does its thing. When the paper gets dragged down, it folds the paper in half before shredding it. If you stick to letter-sized paper though, the Swingline Stack-and-Shred 80X can provide a nice, care-free way to shred documents. .if the paper is wrinkled or smaller pages (smaller than 8x11) or cardstock, the auto feeder chokes.I'm left with the manual feeder which works fine for these other types of paper. I really wanted to love this paper shredder. All of these will result in paper jams. They should also design one that takes the paper from the bottom rather than the top cause it jams every so often.The red color is sharp and reminds me of retro versions of modern products. It does shred paper, but only if you do it *just* right. It won't pull in the paper, it doesn't get it all, and it's just a disaster.- All the shreds pile into the middle of the collector, so you must shake it to disperse them and get it to work again.- Anything beyond one sheet at a time, neatly stacked - and it jams. The paper shredders I have used in the past were admittedly quite cheap, but I didn't use them very often, so I didn't think I needed a good one. It works by feeding paper through the shredder one a time, one after the other. If you really hate shredding paper, this is a great product for either personal or small business use. The crumpled up paper and card stock can go through the manual feeder but laminated documents are a no-no. Imagine folding this paper in half with a horizontal crease. But if you think you can just put the paper in the bin and walk away, think again. Thin paper (receipts, thermal paper) doesn't go through unless you force them (it appears that the teeth can't grab the thinner paper). Instead of feeding paper to it, you use it like you would a dishwasher or washing machine. I also like the paper replacement bag that came with the shredder, it does make emptying it easier--but I'm not sure I would pay money to keep these on hand.Bottom line:  If you often have stacks of letter size unfolded paper that you need to shred then this would be a good machine to do that. Thin paper like receipts can be fed in only by pushing them through manually. Yes, shredded paper does fall out and make somewhat of a mess but I have had that with every single shredder I've ever used.My only complaint is that there were a couple times when I would close the lid and shredding did not start immediately.A
