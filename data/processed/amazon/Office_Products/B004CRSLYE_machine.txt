A wonderful, quiet, and efficient machine. We love this machine. The machine stopped a couple of times the first time I did this, but when I read the instructions (recommended!!! The machine will also shred smaller paper clips and standard staples, but the instructions say to remove those to extend the life of the shredder. I am aware of the machine's limitations and for every shredding session I have counted all the papers that I shred at a time ensuring that they do not go over the 60 page limit. This machine helped me clean up my home office. The machine is also quiet and very compact, so it fits nicely under the side of the desk in my home office. The machine is not too fond of staples. I was impressed.This machine is excellent at making the process of shredding easier.

This machine does shred paper, which is the only reason I'm giving it two stars rather than one.

The adding machine tape stapled to it had about 5 folds making it 10 thicknesses on its own, but it is only the width of adding machine tape.

When the machine is feeding the sheets for you, you don't really care if it does them one at a time.
