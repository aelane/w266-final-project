The paper and plastic from punching the holes went into a neat little waste drawer underneath and not all over the place. Lining the paper up to get the holes on the comb was a little tedious at first, but it didn't take me long to get the hang of it. Can't beat paper when it's done right.- Assembling technical information in one place. Built in paper punch.4. Very spacious paper waste tray.5. paper. That's using standard paper. If you use heavier paper, it's less sheets. 2) Being able to adjust the paper depth for the punch.Other than that (which is minor since this is for home personal use, not for business or professional use) this is really a very good comb binding machine and I would recommend it in this area to anyone looking at it.Why?The Pros -My most favorite thing on this machine is in one of the right side slot trays. I would never buy one without this, with the little paper stopper to the left (it's blue, and the wheel to turn it is down and a bit more left, they're the only two blue things on the machine, which was smart, but it would have helped if they had put something about in the instructions) you need to see exactly where it's going to punch out and adjust. I used a 32 lb glossy paper and it's nice and sturdy. Mind you, the heavier the paper, the less pages you will be able to punch.That being said, do not jam them into the punch slot, you want them to flow in smoothly and make absolutely sure they're even; I had to reprint a few things where the paper tilted.
