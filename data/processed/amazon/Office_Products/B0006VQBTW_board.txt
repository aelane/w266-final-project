I bought a white board that came with one of these markers and I thought it was ingenious but when I purchased this pack from Amazon, the markers were very poor quality. Some how white board erasers, seem to disappear when you need it the most. If you have a white board, yellow is invisible. We have a white board that the kids play with and I thought these markers might be good because they each have their own eraser... no more fighting over the eraser. We have a small dry-erase board at my work that we use on daily basis to write down things that need to be ordered/purchased. The white board I have in my kitchen is actually non magenetic (I didn't know this until after I received these markers), so I have these markers stuck on to my refridgerator. For erasing the whole board, you're still going to want a separate, full-size eraser.These don't seem quite as high quality as the office standards like Expo, but the little handy touches make them nice for home calendars, kids rooms, dorm rooms, etc. I took a white board to a recent reunion to list various events, but also wanted other participants to be able to list activities so I needed a marker that would stay with the board and not be too easy to lose. I was delighted to find these as they magnetically stick to the board and have a built in eraser to boot. I have a large Quartet dry erase board which my daughter likes to doodle on, so I was happy to find this set of colored, magnetized dry-erase markers that would cling right to the whiteboard without getting lost! So to replace them on the board, you must replace the cap. The board had a buckle in the magnetic whiteboard. Because they are magnetic, they stick to the board and are always handy when we want to write something. AND, they have a micro-white board eraser on the other end! Since they're so small, they're rather short and it's hard to control them when writing on my wall-mounted board. They're okay when the board is on a tabletop, though. Because these are fine-tip, they are great for a small dry-erase board but not for a giant, training-room whiteboard. The board only came with a single black marker and these are terrific for when you want to leave a note or draw a picture in other colors. I tried cleaning off the board, to see if that would help, but then the markers wouldn't write on the board at all. If you need to erase the whole board, use a regular eraser. If you keep your board on the refrigerator like I do, then the markers will fall off if you shut the door. The board still has to be wiped down after use.Regarding the magnets, none of them are strong enough to hold the markers to the board. I like to write it all out on a big white board instead of sheets of paper, so I can digest it all at once when I'm done.
