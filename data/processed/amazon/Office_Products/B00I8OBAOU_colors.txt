Also, I would like some of the colors to be darker. The colors don't show up that well. I love all the colors. I love the colors and the fine point actually makes it easier to read. The colors are vibrant deep hues of : Blue, Violet, Pink, Red, Orange, Brown, Green and Black. Beautiful colors and super fine tip. Low-odor, nice colors (way more options for dry-erase than have been available to date), and a REALLY NICE &#34;ultra-fine&#34; point tip. Having 8 colors in the pack makes them even more useful for things like color coding projects on a dry erase calendar.These wouldn't be a good choice for big coloring projects or writing visibly on a chalk-board sized white board, but for fine writing and detailed art projects these are just right. The colors are bold and vibrant as well! I like the colors, and I love that the come in ultra-fine point. The colors are bright and easy to see on wipe boards and they wipe off well with a piece of cloth...we use socks. Some of the colors are too light and almost look faded, especially the pink. With eight colors, I can make each item I post stand out from the others. I get tired of the same 4 colors of markers. They don't stink, they wipe off easily (but not too easily) and the colors are strong.
