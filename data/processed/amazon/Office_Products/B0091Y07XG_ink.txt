Soon, I need to change the black ink. As with all ink jets, be prepared to spend a lot on ink.Main review: Epson is one of my favorite brands when it comes to printers since they always seem to do a good job without much fuss and muss. Because the XP-800 is an Epson, you have to use five ink cartridges which could be costly to replace. HOWEVER, not that the ink for this printer is quite expensive. I've tried to re-prime the ink, reseat the cartridges to no avail.-- The paper tray is TINY -- will not hold much paper. the Cyan ink not being output). We will see how long the smaller ink cartridges last  -- which could be a major issue since they cost 50 bucks for a set... if you have to replace them every month or 2, you could be running in to big bucks -- in which case a "Workforce" printer may be a better investment.I guess it all boils down to what you want in your printer.-- if you are more concerned about low-output but high quality and ease of use, then the Expression series is a great choice.-- if you are interested in more typical office use and lower cost-to-own, then you should go for one of the Workforce printers -- despite the large footprint. The ink cartridges are a somewhat unusual elongated shape. The black ink cartridge is double width. There are 5 ink cartridges, including one document-black and one photo-black. I recommend purchasing the oversized ink cartridge replacements when the time comes. I recently put my Epson Artisan 837 aside due to a clogged black ink nozzle (head cleaning does nothing) to use this Epson XP-800. The ink monitor showed that black was low, so I dutifully bought a new Genuine Epson cartridge. Also, the ink replacements cost way too much. I prefer the larger ink cartridges and if this had had them I would have given this a 5 star instead of 4.3. But, BEWARE, ink costs are on the high side.Physically, the XP-800 is smaller than average at 15.4 inches wide by 13.3 inches deep by 7.5 inches tall when all doors and trays are closed. The Claria ink set provides vibrant beautiful colors.From Epson site:Ink Type: Claria Premium Ink (smudge, scratch and water resistant photos)4Ink Palette: Black, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Photo BlackInk Cartridge Configuration: 5 individual ink cartridgesFade Resistance / Print Longevity: Up to 200-year album storagevery nice printer period  -just love the size - takes up a lot less space. I loaded the ink and printed a test pattern and a WiFi report and was very happy with the speed and crispness of the black type print.
