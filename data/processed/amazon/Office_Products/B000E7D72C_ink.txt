The liquid ink is quite bold and shows up well on dry-erase surfaces. The ink was pretty dark... not the darkest or clearest I've seen, but good. They write well without leaving too much excessive ink. The ink flows well, and they write very easily.What isn't super about the markers? You can tell how much ink is left in them and the caps stay on very nicely. See-through ink gauge on the marker barrel so you know how much ink is left!Now where did that marker go? The ink erases off a white board well. I stopped using them because of this, but they were running low on ink anyway. It is also nice to be able to see how much ink is left in the markers.As I have found in the past, changing brands of markers from what I usually use made for some erasing problems on my white board. The ink smells like rubbing alcohol if placed right at the nose but never an issue during actual using distance. They write beautifully and never dry out until the ink is gone. The ink is well, and solid, but most importantly, there is very little odor, and when compared to my Expo brand markers, there is barely anything at all.This is a very good quality, and might replace my brand preference. The ink level is clear but it doesn&#8217;t seem to last very long. The ink also wipes very cleanly off the dry erase board I use daily on my refrigerator.

I love these liquid ink dry-erase Quartet markers.

So what I like about these is that when the ink is gone you can see it!Moving on... the colors are good and bright and unlike many sets, there are arguably no &#34;throw these away, they're too pale to be seen from 8 feet away&#34;.
