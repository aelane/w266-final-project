The base is sturdy and steady. To take it out of the base, you just slide it off one side of the base. The base weighs just over 1 lb (16.5oz). The base has a small latch that clicks into place when you insert the board. As long as the base can latch on to it, it's all good.It is important to note that there is no spine for this. The base is nice and heavy which helped avoid any tipping or falling while I was working. It has a detachable base (stand) and a detachable clip (think "Chip Clip" meets iPad-sized whiteboard). The base is heavy, so it isn't constantly falling over when papers are shuffled or if you accidentally knock against it, and the removable clip is sturdy and easy to use. A base, board, and clip, that is put together easily. It has a weighted base that would be a nice paperweight even without the memo board inserted into it. The base is a good weight so it's not easily knocked over, and it holds the backboard at a perfect angle for reading text. Removing it from the base, I can take it to a meeting and use it as a clipboard.I also put a business card magnet on it and it stuck. The base itself also is flexible in placement. The base is slightly weighted so that it won't tip over, but it's not heavy. The base is compact, only about 5" x 5.5".Overall, this is a really nice document holder and great addition to any office. The base is a bit wider than I would like, but it great for keeping heavier things like composition books in place. And because it's not attached to the base, you can use it as a clipboard as well.This is well-made, sturdy, and multifunctional. The base is slanted so you can't set anything on top of it. The base, which secures the memo board, is the heaviest part of the product, but still light enough to carry in one hand with the board attached. The base is a good weight so it doesn't knock over when I brush against it by mistake, and the clip is movable too! I am surprised by how well it works, and the base can also support a tablet /iPad type device. The base is nice and heavy, and the design looks modern enough for any cubicle. The base is weighted and feels very solid.

The base is weighted and sturdy.

It does have a base with enough weight to maintain stability; the board snaps onto the base at a reasonable viewing angle and the clip snaps onto the board.

The base is heavy enough that it will stand up on my bed next to me while I work on my laptop.
