Really nice pens, when these run out I'll definitely buy them again. These are really SWEET pens!! LOL -- Turns out that I have TWO purple pens that look SO much alike -- the purple pen with Black ink is a "giveaway" from the County Fair, so YES the Paper MatePurple pen HAS Purple Ink! But they'll remain desk pens. 4 pens: purple, blue, red, and black. I love writing with pens, and I do so everyday. I love these pens. Usually the good pens don't do well over correction pens. However, these particular pens write really good over correction pens. !I would be lost without pens. I really like these pens, the ink flows very easily and they just have a good grip feel to them. These pens are great! Then to get pens in different color inks is very rare. I recommend these pens for anyone who enjoys writing with a quality pen. Many cheaper pens are too narrow and have no gripping surface- two qualities that can cause discomfort after writing for a short time. I have used better pens in my day, but when economy is considered, these Papermate pens rank among the better ones on the market. These are the first pens I've ever had that come tipped with a tiny dot of red wax to keep them fresh and sealed! I first saw these pens in a retail store where they had a "writing station" set up so you could try the pens out. However, these InkJoy pens are a real pleasure to write with. Overall, I highly recommend these pens for all sorts of uses. I'm pretty picky about pens, and the PaperMate InkJoy is a great little pen. I have not been terribly impressed overall with these pens. I very much like these pens. I prefer retractable pens, so that's a bonus. I liked the pens in this package. These pens are amazing! Paper Mate Inkjoy pens are the best pens I have ever used! These are great pens as long as you don't let them freeze (left one overnight in my truck with the expected results. I think when I write, pens in general creep out of my hands as my fingers slip down the pen from writing pressure. The pens are handsome, with sleek black and  silver-colored design.I'd be very happy with these if it were not for one thing -- they are too thin for my "feel." )The pens are winners! These pens are very comfortable to hold and easy flowing ink makes writing easy. Still very nice and easy to write with, highly recommended if you like lightweight pens. These are excellent pens, even when compared to non-disposable ball-points. While I wouldn't say I was excited ordering disposable pens, I would say that I was impressed once I started using them. I have to start out by saying that I love pens. I very much liked these pens. I'm always dropping pens while moving around at my desk or talking to people around the office, and this grip strip seems to cut down on that.The pens also have a strong metal clip that holds securely.I do find it hard to distinguish between the purple pen and the blue pen, especially in not-bright lighting (I'm talking about the exterior pen barrel, not the ink). These are really nice, non-refillable, colored pens, that write really nicely as the tip glides across the paper.The ink does not smear UNLESS they are not used for a while, then the ink can gunk up on the tip a little when you write the first letter, and that will smear. These are not as large as some of the more self-consciously ergonomic pens on the market, but they are very easy to hold and the rubberized coating is distributed such that the pens never seem slippery. When I first used these pens, I was very impressed with how easily they glided across the page. I love pens, especially colored ones, because I love to journal, and it's so much more fun when it's colorful. These pens are too thin for me, they kept slipping out of my fingers while writing. I would not recommend these pens. I love buying, using, and trying new pens, and since I'm a teacher, I like having the multi-color packs. I was pleasantly surprised by how smoothly these Paper Mate pens flowed over the paper-- they looked like standard cheap ballpoints, but wrote closer to gel pens with the added bonus of being retractable. I ordered these when they were offered through Vine because, although I love them, the Pilot pens I use sometimes lose their tops and make a mess in my purse. I thought the retractable pens would be better. All in all these pens were disappointing. I was impressed by these pens. I like to use different colored pens depending on what I am writing (grocery list, to-do list, letters, and official paperwork). I will buy these pens again! For all pens, the barrel needs to be comfortable and sturdy in your grip. I have relegated these to the pens I keep out in the open at my office. I love pens. I'm able to grip the pens securely, but the grip isn't particularly soft.The pens write smoothly with little effort; however, I've experienced several instances of very large blobs, particularly with the red pen. I really wanted to like my new pens. These pens glide over the paper. The pens have a very nice line. They are comfortable to hold as I have arthritis some pens are to big or small to hold comfortable for a long time. These are fantastically smooth pens, exactly what you expect from Paper Mate. The Papermate Ink Joy pens have four colors (red, purple, blue and black) and are really lightweight for a full type pen.The ink rolls easily and effortlessly. These pens are on the high end pricewise for a disposable pen. These retractable pens are light as a feather and very comfortable to use. It is difficult to find purple pens! I had perfumed pens that spread a turquoise hue over beflowered paper. The pens are light weight but not too light and have a sturdy clip on them, which is handy in my work bags that have pen pockets.These truly are labled well: they are a joy in ink and I love the added colours available. These pens write with virtually no friction. I liked these pens (once I figured out that you had to pull the wax off the tips first). I love these pens! These Paper Mate Inkjoy pens are undoubtedly the finest pens I have ever used, including some fairly expensive ones. I highly recommend these pens whether you do a lot of writing or a little. I am really impressed by these Paper Mate InkJoy pens. Very nice pens for the non-gifting types such asMontblanc Meisterstuck Legrand Platinum Ballpoint Pen 161. This four-pack comes with red, black, purple and blue pens. These pens really do what they're advertised to do. These rather thin pens impress when one begins writing,and unfortunately clot and that interupts a genuine flow.If they were not supposed to be more exceptional it would not be a big deal.i would not reccommend. I was rather excited when I was able to receive the Inkjoy pens after constantly seeing the commercials for the last couple of months on television.
