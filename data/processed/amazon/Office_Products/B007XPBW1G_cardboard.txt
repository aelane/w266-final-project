A perfect corrugated cardboard box except for that fold, so 4 stars instead of 5. *Use the big cardboard boxes opened up, as floor protectors for painting your new abode! A nice solid cardboard, and the great part is the adjustable box, it slides down/up to securely fit on the item inside, and then tape to secure.In the past I've used bubble wrap, towels and other items for pictures, and still ended up cobbling multiple boxes together to store them, this time they all get their own box, and they still won't take up much room.One thing to note, as while the large/medium contain 4 boxes, the adjustable only contain 3. I'm amazed that cardboard boxes can cost so much, but I've found that when I want to protect the goods I'm storing or moving, I'm constantly impressed by SmoothMove products. The cardboard is nice and thick, should hold up well. The cardboard is sturdy. Sturdy cardboard and easy instructions. I understand why this is - cardboard stock is probably narrower than the total unfolded box size. The cardboard will offer some protection but you do need the added protection of bubble wrap or a blanket. The cardboard is quite sturdy. The cardboard is very sturdy and is equal to the boxes professional movers use.
