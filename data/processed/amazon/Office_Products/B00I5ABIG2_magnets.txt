These magnets are actually much smaller than they appear here, but they do work very well. They are strong magnets and stuck firmly to everything I tried, including my refrigerator and other steel metal surfaces. It took a second, and then we realized there are two magnets stuck together. The magnets look like little chess pawns. They are indisputably the strongest manufactured magnets that are made. The magnets are incredibly strong and can hold up a lot for their tiny size. I had magnets all over my fridge, but they didn't always hold up my children's precious photos or artwork. The very strong magnets are flat and difficult to pry off. But the magnets we often use are thin, usually promotional in nature, and take two or more just to hold a single piece of paper. These neodymium-based magnets have some serious sticking power, and all our promotional magnets are now in the trash.I was shocked at the size of the magnets compared to the gripping power.

Since I have had magnets that won't hold even a business card, I am totally impressed.One thing you should be VERY aware of if you decide to buy these for your home (rather than office).

Neodymium magnets are really awesome.

These are not the ceramic magnets you&#8217;ll find in your local craft store.
