I am typically an Avery product user, but was offered the opportunity to try out some products from 3M recently and decided to give them a go since it was coming up on the time of the year when a lot of filing takes place. Overall, a good product, despite it's limited intended purpose. They work just as well as the Avery product and at least for now are much cheaper. Like usual, 3M is a great product. Great product! Great product! Who doesn't need a great product like this on hand?Anyone who maintains any type of file system using tab folders will find these useful.Thank you 3M and Amazon! It's nice to find a second product option out there on the market! I give this product a rating of 5 stars. Overall this is an excellent product and it gets 5 stars in my book! 3M has created yet another reliable worthwhile product in their stable of great office products.
