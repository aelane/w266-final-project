But for a professional quality print, he still has to take the digital file to a commercial establishment - unless he owns a professional inkjet printer like this Canon PIXMA PRO-1. Good quality paper is essential for quality prints. The quality of the prints out of this printer is fantastic. I never really got the quality I was looking for with third party ink, too much variance between suppliers and even from batches from the same supplier. I highly recommend that you use high quality photo paper, and perhaps even Canon printer paper, to get the most from the printer. But that excellent quality comes at some costs. The quality is great, but for me - is it more convenient and less expensive than sending my files off to Snapfish? If print quality is your main concern, then the Pixma Pro-1 is pretty much the only printer you should be looking at. Done.Print Quality -I can only compare to a Canon Pixma MP990 for quality as it is the only Canon printer I own. Slow is okay when the quality is excellent!The color photgraphs were vivid and life-like, but the black and white were exceptional.This is an amazing machine. They are magnificent quality, but a set of refill cartridges will be incredibly expensive. The quality of the images even on a 11x14 print is just not comparable to any print.Compared to the Pixma Pro-1 and Pixma Pro Mark II 9000 - both are very good, but Pixma Pro-1 clearly shows a greater depth and diversity of colors in detailed nature shots.Cartridge=========Now, coming to the Pro series printers from canon - this is not your level 1/level 2 printers that contain B/W & color or 3 different color cartridges.Pixma Pro 1 comes with 12 Individual cartridgesPixma Pro Mark II 9000 contains 8 individual cartridgesThe number of cartridges will help in producing the most precise color on your prints. The quality and dept of colors will make a huge difference and impact on your customers perception.
