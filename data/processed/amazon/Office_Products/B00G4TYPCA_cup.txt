So many cup holders are just too small to do this with.It looks professional, and is nicely shaped.. This pen cup ceratinly looks much more expensive than $7.77, I'd value it at atleast $15 in a fine stationery store.It is so pretty that I decided I couldn't waste it on my messy computer desk. The pen cup by Swingline is decent-looking, but I found it lacking on a functional level. Personally, I would've preferred a deeper cup. The cup slides all over my desk and will not stay in place. This inconspicuous cup for writing utensils would work well with any office decor. I thought this little pen cup was going to be light weight and probably tip over when I filled it with pens. This acrylic cup is heavy and looks very clear, at least when new. I like how thick this cup is. The pen cup is a really good looking addition to my desk. This is a very sturdy cup, it won't fall over and it is made of thick plastic so if it hits the deck it will not crack or shatter. I like this pen cup because the acrylic is strong and heavy. This is a nice looking pen cup. This is a very attractive and sturdy pen cup.
