Canon has produced printer that is loaded with features, economically priced for the home market. Just CD.And so I am stuck with a Frankenstein printer that requires you to jump through hoops to print a CD. Further, the printer will not work with CD printing software that is not Canon. It came out great, very fast, after the printer did it's warm up dance. My other printer is a compact HP, so that it fits underneath my keyboard in a compact computer kiosk. This printer has all the bells and whistles, data cards, USB, etc. The printer is compact, easy to assemble, and easy to operate. Highly recommended as a capable printer for a reasonable price. This printer is easy to set-up for wireless printing and works well with Apple AirPort, which is what I purchased it for to work with our MacBook, iPad and iPod touch. Unfortunately I cannot say the same for this printer. I do not recommend this printer for photo printing. That printer retailed $199.99 but was on sale for $59.99. Unfortunately, that printer sold out lightning fast. With the printer came a sample pack of about 10 4 x 6 sheets. This printer is a 9600 maximum dpi printer. Because this printer supports Airprint, it automatically shows up on your Apple devices as long as you set up the PIXMA printer on your local home network AND your Apple devices are on the same network. Grayscale Printing must be enabled.That's it.Lastly, I would suggest you not turn this printer off and NOT use the power save feature. EVERYTIME the printer does this, it wastes a little bit of ink. This printer produces great quality output, and i've printed over 300 full color pages without any problems. I bought this printer specifically because it can print on heavier card stock using the rear load feature. This printer is my second Pixma and first AirPrint model. This printer really makes the Kodak printer it replaced look like garbage. I bought this printer after another printer had an error code and was too expensive to be fixed. I love this printer. I just tell the printer to take the paper from the rear tray and it never gets stuck. Other than that, I am very happy with this printer and will buy another when the time comes. I bought this printer since it is not advisable to use stick-on labels for blu-ray players. Again, this is probably not atypical for a printer within this price range.Overall, this printer gives you exactly what it promises. This printer accomplishes basic tasks that would be required of it in a non-professional home office/casual use environment. This printer seems to be a safe buy that should offer reliable and hassle-free home service.This product is made in Thailand. The printer is almost completely smooth on top, black, with sexy cobalt blue lighting.I've printed about 15 pages of pictures so far and they look absolutely great. And this printer is smart, too--I closed the output tray to have a look at the paper supply tray and forgot to put the tray back down. The printer is "Ink Tank Compatible" which I had to look up online to figure out. This is truly a great little printer. I'm excited to have a working printer again and can't wait to see what else this machine can do.ETA: Set-up, start to finish including opening the box and unwrapping the printer took approximately 40 minutes. Also, this printer is sitting on my very sturdy dining room table (handmade farmhouse style table made of 100% real wood) and when it prints it shakes the table. That could be said to be a pro for the printer because for it to shake my entire dining room table it must be a sturdy machine, but it could also be a con depending on what surface you have the printer setting on. I primarily intend to use this printer as an auxiliary printer in my home. Also, Apple's Lion OS has many printer drivers built in, but not this one.

After using the printer for about a month, it seems like it can complete the tasks that would be expected by most home users with the added bonus of being wireless right out of the box.This is what we like about the printer:1.Easy set-up:  The set-up is straightforward and easy with the included CD.

The printer connected to our secured wireless network with no problems and the software was installed quickly on two laptops, again, with no difficulties.

Great looking:  As noted, this is a sleek black printer that fits into the design of the home office.4.
