I love these tabs because they attach well to the page yet, if you want to move them, they easily detach without marking the book. These tabs are great for marking pages that you want to refer to later on. The tabs can be placed and replaced. I now use these tabs!! I place them right over the plastic tabs. When the tabs need to be removed, they come off easily without leaving a residue. Writing on the tabs is easy and legible due to the slighty textured surface. These tabs are the perfect size for me, it's 1 inch in width and about 1 and half inch in length. When you take one of the tabs out of the plastic container, another pops into position for use. The tabs are very durable. Yes, these tabs stay in place but let go gracefully and without damage or residue when you use care to peel them off. I love these sturdy tabs. These tabs are stiff but position easily, and they come off to reposition equally well. The tabs pull out one by one from a thin plastic holder, alternating sides as you pull them, staying clean and organized. These Post-it tabs have proven to be the best I have used to date. Great handy tabs, that allows me to create "dividers" in my notebook. These tabs are self adhesive. I have used other tabs in the past that my labeling would rub off. This did not occur with these tabs. I like this nice alternative to full-page tabs. These Post-it tabs are small and invaluable for helping to organize post-holiday chaos, or any easily-labeled chaos for that matter. There are only 36 tabs in this package, and they disappear fast -- mine are almost all gone now that I've finished labeling the music -- so it's a good idea to purchase several packs at once for a larger project. Using these Post-It durable tabs will prevent this from happening, and also permit writing on the tab flagging the page with a marker. These diminutive Post-it Durable tabs allow me to color code my organization. These tabs come in three colors and are packaged in a handy little dispenser. I like that the tabs are a nice durable plastic that can be repositioned. Because these tabs can be repositioned, they can also double as a book mark. I like these little tabs, but I prefer the larger versions. These tabs are really quite small, but they're nice and tough, and they stick well. I use these tabs for a lot of reasons. I tend to write on my tabs while they are still in the dispenser. I love little tabs like this. These sticky tabs are a nice product to help keep things organized in your file drawers, or to tab places of interest in books or reference materials. The tabs are sturdy, not flimsy, so should hold up to wear and tear. These tabs are great for marking chapters in a textbook or noting the answer key to a test. And these are the perfect tabs to relabel that folder and have the name of the file stick up so that it's easy to see and find the folder you're looking for. These little tabs make labeling your folders a breeze, and they can also take the place of those plastic filing tabs that need typed inserts. The tabs are easy to use and firs in binders as well as folders very easily . Previously, I would make my own tabs out of Post-it Notes, but my homemade tabs weren't durable enough to withstand the repeated use. These tabs are perfect for the task....very writable and rigid enough to hold their space and be easily seen.I have already used up my trial allotment and am about to purchase more. these are the best tabs i have used. These tabs are just what I was looking for for my research! These tabs are excellent for most applications. )Furthermore, these little tabs adhere to surfaces well, but can be removed and reused. The tabs themselves stand up to accidentally spilled liquids - your writing does not smear! These are nice, sturdy tabs.
