I left the cap off of one of the markers, tip-up, for 24 hours...and what do you know, it worked. I like to take the cap off and place it on the opposite end of the marker, as a means for storage while I write with the marker. The cap on this dry erase marker actually snaps into place on the opposite end of the market. I also love how the cap is not round, so it stops the marker from simply rolling off of the counter or desk. The cap snaps easily onto the end of the cap for safekeeping while using the marker.If you are feeling bold, go for these markers. Haven't lost a single cap yet. Haven't tested that, as we haven't lost a cap. The cap does fit on the end for if you have to write a long passage, unlike some dry erase pens.I will buy these thick Quartet dry-erase markers in the future, I just won't trust the mini ones. I took the cap of a marker at around 4:00 PM one afternoon and tried them at 9:00 AM the next day. The cap snaps securely on both ends keeping it handy when writing and keeping your marker in great condition when it's lying dormant. An Anti-roll cap that keeps your marker where you left it!Seriously, I jest with all the exclamation marks, but they really did make a better widget here. Then I forgot and left the cap off for 3 days. The cap's shape keeps the markers from rolling too far away when you drop them (and if the cap is on when you drop them), which is an advantage. They are easy to take the cap off and they snap into place very well so you are less likely to have a dried out marker from the cap not snapping on. Carefully designed cap prevents rolling off the surface and odor is low. The cap is a neat design and the marker doesn&#8217;t roll all over the place which is a plus for us because we don&#8217;t have a white board with a hinge to keep markers in place.
