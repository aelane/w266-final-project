These markers worked well both on the black board provided, and on a white board. And writing on it with the neon markers makes the writing look even more like "chalk on a chalkboard" which I like. The markers you use on the white/gray boards (black, blue, etc) may leave color residue on the board, but this is not an issue when you are mixing and matching black and blue. Non-magnetic markers: We are already missing one marker. The markers DO work on a regular white board. The markers that come with it are claimed to be "NEON" and that they "Writes Bright". It comes with three dry-erase markers. The three different markers are readable against the black board, and they wipe off easily with a paper towel, leaving no markings. The markers aren't overpowering and the mounting works fine. The markers wipe completely clean without any telltale residue. The markers don't lay don't a good line. The markers have held up fabulously so far to the daily onslaught by the kids.Overall, this is the best dry erase board I have owned, simply because it stays put on the fridge. The bright-colored markers are nice, too, though their ink is somewhat `ghostly' and not as vivid as you might expect. The markers are pretty bright against the black background so don't worry about having a hard time seeing the neon markers.This Expo board is a great message system for the family so please buy one today. The markers do have chisel points, so it's easy to write legible messages.I have used white dry erase boards before and one thing I like about this black board is that it does not show residue from the markers after you have erased it a few times. The markers just wipe off when you are ready to remove them. There are 3 different colored markers with one board and mounting magnets/stickers (whatever you prefer). The markers write well and have a round tip. Chunky markers on a teeny board limit what you write in the space.Since the board is black, it shouldn't get grungy like the white boards. The markers write smoothly and I like that you get 3 color choices. The markers are okay and the neon looks cool on the black background but sometimes they don't always write perfectly. The markers work well and look good and the surface can be easily cleaned (even after a while) with a paper towel. We're already having to hunt for the markers each time we use it and I don't like wasting a paper towel everytime we want to wipe it down. It comes with 3 markers, yellow, orange, and hot pink that boldly appear on the board and can be easily seen from the next rooms. The markers write smooth and have no odor. The markers may not be so bright, but they're visible enough. The markers are a bit harder to erase than standard white board markets but they more than make up for that by readability and the pizazz they add to the white board. I use the markers for every presentation now when using a whiteboard. Strangely, the markers were more solid & vivid on a white board than on the included black board, where they came out sort of translucent. I usedVelcro Dotsto attach the markers to the board.The magnet tape is very secure and it makes a good message center. Finally, while the markers are bright enough, you should not expect them to be as good as a white board counterparts.The cost and size of the product actually makes these minor details ignorable. The markers are bullet-tipped, so the writing is somewhat fine. However, if you plan on using the markers on a larger dry-erase board, you'd probably want chisel-tipped markers instead, for a broader print size.The board seems to erase cleanly with nothing more than a dry paper towel. The markers do not smell too bad though. There is nowhere to store the markers, so you run the risk of losing them unless you designate a drawer for them -- and even then, they may not get put back where they're supposed to be.

These markers wrote well and laid down a heavy enough amount of ink to show up, but the colors were disappointing.

The markers, thank goodness, don't reek.

The markers do well with the included blackboard - but please keep in mind the type of lighting you have in the room may also affect how they look.
