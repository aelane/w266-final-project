Why not a simple on/off button?Overall, this certainly serves it's purpose, but for the price you maybe better off buying a jump drive and one of those novelty laser pointers and come out ahead. Well, there is not much that can go wrong here - it has a button for forward, one for backward, one for black screen, and one for the laser pointer.You just start your presentation (I use MS Powerpoint) and click through the slides. What I don't understand is the "Black Screen" button. I found myself trying to find the right button on the R800 from time to time.The Kensington's green laser isn't very bright. Basic button layout is also very good.3. While there is no specific "on" or "off" button on the unit, the directions do state to prolong battery life when not in use, to turn "off" the remote by inserting the receiver into the remote.A good functional little unit, just a little pricey. The top button activates the laser pointer. The bottom button is to stop your presentation and go to a black screen.I used the Presenter with my Mac and it worked flawlessly.This is a RF controller, not infrared, so it should be quite reliable and in my short time using it so far, it has been totally reliable. Where's the on-off button? The Stop button is a nice feature. If the Next button is pressed again, the presentation will appear in its design window (e. g. the PowerPoint window). The Stop button does not black out the screen if the presentation is in design window.Laser Pointer:  Sharp, clear laser pointer. It's light, ergonomically correct, and when you push a button the feedback is immediate and certain.I like the laser-pointer aspect, although I find the activating it takes some getting used to, and I occasionally moved to the next slide rather than get the pointer working. (The lower button toggles blackout mode in PowerPoint, which is nice if you want to focus your audience's attention on something other than the slides for a moment.)
