It also doesn't slide around on my keyboard tray. My old one would easily slide/fall of the keyboard tray when I closed it. It is comfortable for using on a normal keyboard or (as I am doing) on a laptop on a cooling pad. I've been using theMicrosoft Wireless Comfort Desktop 5000(ergonomic and padded) keyboard for most PC functions. If you have a higher, bulkier keyboard, you may need a thicker support.I highly recommend that potential buyers try out various supports in stores before ordering online since the amount of firmness and the feel of a support is critical for individual comfort. It's long enough to handle the keyboard and my mouse/mouse pad...and I'm a light gamer so it's a pretty big mousepad. Naturally, if your keyboard already has a built-in wrist platform this gel pad isn't going to produce any additional benefit. If you prefer an ergonomic keyboard (which I do) it doesn't fit up properly against the front edge. Using the keyboard was uncomfortable not just because of the angle but because of an uneven, gappy desktop. It is extremely comfortable and I can see how it would be really great..but not on a thin keyboard It is very easy to clean, just wipe it down.All in all if you don't mind keeping your keyboard and mouse aligned straight this will work well for you. I picked this because it's long enough for both my keyboard and my mouse. I really like it for my keyboard (which isn't super thin, it's about 7/8" tall) but I don't like it for my mouse. I think the keyboard and mouse need their own separate wrist rests. Something to be aware of that this may happen to you as well if you have a thin, low-profile keyboard. I thought that I would also enjoy the keyboard size as well. This keyboard rest, like the mouse rest, is exactly what I wanted, and I think they are the best in their categories. My old keyboard had a built in wrist rest, but when I bought a new keyboard, I realized I needed a wrist rest. I'm thinking of utilizing this long one solely for my keyboard and getting the miniature one for the mouse, since I have quite a big mouse pad by SteelSeries. Also, as indicated, it's pretty long, so it covers for both the keyboard and the mouse. It is heavy enough that it stays put and my keyboard fits snugly against it. I ended up not using it.Your keyboard has to be fairly high for this wrist rest to provide comfort to you. My keyboard rests on my desk's keyboard tray in such a way that while I type, the front edge of the tray would dig into my forearms. It is also long enough that you can use it for the keyboard and mouse at the same time.If you want a good wrist rest, spend the extra money and get one of these. I haven't felt it MOVE much less fall off the keyboard tray. My keyboard tray is a little on the small side, so when I put the wrist rest on it, it didn't really fit and kept sliding off. Unless you are washing your keyboard daily you already have microbes everywhere.It looks good, it feels good and it does what it says it will do. I have my keyboard in a wooden desk that pulls out. I use an Apple keyboard and didn't have any problems with the height of the rest. I didn't like this; moving the keyboard forward out of the way was a bigger hassle than it should have been, and the keyboard itself should prevent the wrist rest from sliding in the first place.The edge of the wrist rest that goes against your keyboard is flat, but side facing you is convex, curved towards you.
