Double-sided printing was perfect and fast. Color printing varied depending on the resolution I picked.The scan feature worked just as well. The printing is fast and the machine is not nearly as loud. I like that I can now do 2-sided printing, scanning, etc. I just want quick printing and long lasting ink and this should do the trick. Dual sided printing is supported and easy to use. This should make for some long printing between changes. The printing is fast and documents are high quality. Maybe I should have expected that--maybe the two-sided printing capability needs extra room. I can't claim that the printing costs are reduced by 50% because I haven't had it long enough to prove. I love the 2-sided printing feature - and it is fast! It works with Google's Cloud printing service. However, printing is not instantaneous when you push "print". Given printing is the majority of what I'll use this device for, I was impressed at all my attempts to throw print jobs at it. Again, plain text and document printing looks quite crisp. The "printing" area of the new printer was working fine, and it was on some new EPSON port. I'll be doing MOSTLY black and white printing, so the colors won't go down as fast, but still. Heck, if I don't vary my current printing needs, I should only need to purchase replacements every 8-9 months. However, if you have moderate printing needs, and want an all-in-one machine, I really recommend the WP-4530. Two-sided printing worked without a hitch, and offers various options, including a setting to allow for increased drying time before printing the second side. ; Two sided printing is another great feature allowing saving of paper if desired.AIRPRINTJust a word to fellow iPhone / iPad owners out there - this IS an AirPrint printer! The general printing capabilities work well for while, but then they go wacky and replacing the cartridges is a waste of time. Most of the basic printing works well for a while, but then it fails. Double-sided printing works flawlessly...no jamming of the pages and no smearing; drying time between sides can be manually adjusted to account for heavier ink printing jobs, such as photo-rich text/photo documents.4.) I use this for printing invoices and shipping labels, and having black ink everywhere is just unprofessional.
