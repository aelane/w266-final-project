Great book - durable pages and binding. The book is designed to remove the pages without too much hassle. The book is solid enough to carry around. The book is made of sturdy cardboard and should fit into most backpacks easily. This Academie Wirebound Sketch Diary (&#34;14 x 11 &#34;) is a very fine 70-paged book of high quality, acid-free drawing paper. Great book for school level art projects. They are very young so not professional to say the very least, but I could see this book being useful to people at all skill levels. This is great sketch book for all sorts of purposes. It's hard to use the book in the field, or on your knees, without something more supportive underneath. And, although large, the book still fits easily in a standard backpack. I rated Academie Wirebound sketch book 5 stars because of the dimensions/large size.
