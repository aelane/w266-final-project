This new Post-It roll is perfect as it is lightweight and easy to roll to whatever length I like. I definitely will buy another roll. I'll report back after I try it...I will definitely be choosing the roll version of Post-It's over the flappy note paper squares version from now on. However, after receiving it, I found this roll to be simple but seductive in its concept as a "do-it-yourself" post-it sizer. I keep a roll next to my computer and one in my desk. It is just like having a roll of tape that you can write on. When I saw Post-It on a roll I thought it was a great idea, and after using it, I still do. The bright green roll is 400", more than enough to use numerous times. I've used this roll I received from Amazon Vine a lot and it hasn't run out yet. I keep a roll in my kitchen pantry so I can label stuff that I put in the freezer. I took this roll with me when I moved my son into his boarding school dorm. I brought the roll back home with me and went on a labeling spree in my attic and basement storage room, too. "Post it on a roll" is a nifty permutation. The roll that I can tear off only what I need was a great idea...thanks 3M. It also does not stick to itself more than just enough to make the roll hold together.This worked well for me in doing a reorganization project on bookshelves. This adhesive roll is great to have around. Obviously, it isn't necessary to have Post-Its on a roll. But it's nice having this little roll around. At first I thought the roll was double sided and looked forward to making and hanging banners, wrapping packages, etc. Anyway, I would rather have a roll of this full-adhesive Post-it stuff than a bucket of Post-it notes. But the Post-it roll changes that - you just pull out any sized piece you want and stick it in the book (personally, I extend it past the outside margin to make things easy to find). And I'm going to make sure that I always have a Post-it roll in my desk drawer from this point on. I loe that it is fully adhesive and comes on a roll. My roll of tape arrived today, with perfect timing. This roll solves all of those problems. since it's on a roll, I can make my tag bigger than needed so I can hold the tag in place while I'm writing. Also, since it's a roll the paper is completely sticky on once side as opposed to the plastic flags which have half of the flag with stick-um and half without. This roll is something like a cross between masking tape and Post-it notes. This roll of postit adhesive is great for labels. This dispenses like a roll of tape and you can write notes on it. This roll of the fully sticky ones have saved my sanity! I can put the roll on my table right next to me, still can stick my notes on my computer but they but they don't come off until I take them off! The roll is awesome!! I really appreciate the post-it roll best for marking food containers in the fridge. The post-it roll has the same quality adhesive of a typical post-it pad, but it is all over the back of the 1 inch strip.I found the tearing/cutting action a bit jerky, so my strips always look torn at the ends. It's like a roll of tape of "Post-it" note.The advantage this has over "Post-it" notes is that the entire surface is covered with adhesive. So here we have Post-it Adhesive roll. This little roll of paper tape is great. You can use this roll of Post-it tape for labeling. The Post-It Full adhesive roll makes it easy to label them. This roll of post it sticky note paper works like a roll of scotch tape. The roll comes in a dispenser which they claim cuts the perfect length every time. When I run out of this labeling adhesive roll, I'll be buying more. Just like a roll of tape, it has the same full sticky backing. I never want to be without a roll again!

She has been using a roll of masking tape and a felt marking pen, but now is experimenting with the new Post-it roll.

The roll of tape is like the sticky part of a regular Post-It note, so it is all sticky, with no non-sticky parts.

This is basically a long roll of sticky notes.
