Every pen has a tiny cap on the tip of the refill to prevent the ink from drying out. I really love the new Big Triumph pen! It's the only pen I've ever used where the bottom copy of the form is readable.A true Triumph in engineering and design! Finding a good pen that gets the job done well and doesn't cost a fortune is a rare find. First, the pen is a bit thick and uncomfortable to use. Then you loosen the pen up again, and repeat, to no success.My husband was all excited when he saw the box of pens...and then he tried one. The pen has a classy look, with a clip-on. I like this pen. Regardless, this Triumph is a nice looking pen and has a comfortable feel to it. The BIC Triumph 730RT Gel Pen (0.7mm) is a nice pen to look at, feels solid but not overly large in my hand, and usually writes a nice solid line on plain paper. The new Bic 730RT is a nice pen, it has a very smooth even flow and leaves a nice line of consistent width. I have never recommended a pen to anyone as I feel they are so abundant that there is a unique pen for virtually everyone, and similarly, because I tend to lose them, I am usually the one asking "You gotta a pen I can borrow?" I used this pen to write a letter to my family member on a high quality cotton paper and performance was really good. I handed the pen I was using to co-worker and she too liked it. I've finally used the very last pen from this box of 12 and I'm impressed by the consistency. This pen is a joy to write with. I'd definitely buy this pen again and again. "I highly recommend this pen to folks who want a quality writing instrument without paying big bucks. At $2 a pen they are elegant enough for gifting with say a journal or keepsake book. This particular pen is a lovely grey and black streamlined pen.

I like a pen with a little heft, and these guys have that.

This is a very comfortable pen by Bic with smooth ink flow that writes very clearly.

I don't think you can ask much more from a pen.
