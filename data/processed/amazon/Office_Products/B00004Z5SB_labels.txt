These labels are perfect for many uses. I use them for shipping labels and for labeling items that I am storing. Avery labels are great! I love Avery labels! The labels print flawlessly every time. These labels are what I have needed for years. I have actually put together 2 small labels all these years. Finally, I can now print the labels from my computer and easily attach to the packages. I have used them to put labels on a small bag of popcorn. These labels worked great. Overall, I'm very happy with these labels. :-)  These labels are no exception. Because they're labels, not a cure for cancer. I like the labels, but it's not like we're going out or anything. Not so with these labels with TrueBlock Technology! Avery makes great labels. This works perfect and by using printed labels you names and address etc... are easy to read and legible, also if someone moves, just place a new label over top, possibly you might be able to remove the old one. Worked well for labels on envelopes 250 labels in the compact sleeve holder. The Avery labels have been around for a long time now and work as well as ever. These labels are heavy grade of paper that will completly cover any errors that you might have made on a previous label as long as this label size is the same as your original label. I bought these labels for two reasons; one, to use as shipping labels; second, for labelling my DVD storage cases. The labels are bright white and well designed with a professional appearance. The labels have a grey blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I print the title of the movie or TV show and stick it to the cover of DVD storage cases. It is easy to print on these labels from my laser printer. I have rated these labels four stars for the design, quality and overall satisfaction. These are good, standard solid INK JET labels from Avery - template suggestions are always on the package (so helpful) and I've used both the 3M version, Avery version, and branded store versions (like Office Depot) - they all work well as address labels - if you are wondering how to choose, I'd make your decision based on price, and features such as the TrueBlock Technology included on these (which makes using a a recycled box or envelope much easier - it's thicker and truly covers up the older used labels below! These labels can be peeled off without much effort, which is great if your recipient wants to reuse the box, but not so great if you want to ensure that the label stays put and can't be removed. The labels make it easy to reuse boxes and large envelopes because they have a gray blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I've had no trouble using my ink-jet printer to print the labels and the Avery templates make it snap to produce professional looking results. These labels are great for packages and are the type I use most often.As for the stickiness of these labels, I would say they are about average. Overall, these are good labels, but there isn't a whole lot of difference between them and others. These labels are excellent.

I give these labels my highest recommendation as I like to recycle packaging (envelopes, boxes, plastic mailers) and they are sufficiently thick so that you only need one to cover up any addresses, codes, instructions that would ordinarily make it hard to reuse packaging.

Priced reasonably and there is little else to say about "labels."

These labels from Avery work pretty much as advertised.
