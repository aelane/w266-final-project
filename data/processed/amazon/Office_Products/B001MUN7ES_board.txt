I use this white board at home while helping my kid with his homework. However, the board is not really that big, so it is unlikely that you would clip something on the board that is of any significant size. I like the board, it is magnetic too so you can use the magnets to put something on the board too. This board was very quick and easy to mount. I'll be replacing that little pen, but otherwise, it's a great board. Aside from that, the board takes all kind of dry erase markers with no problems. It will hold the board in place over top part of the refrigerator but when I tried to place it lower (About at the level of the divider between the freezer and fridge compartments) It slides to the floor. The white board itself works fine, and is of good quality. The white board itself always wipes clean. If you push the board from the side, it will slide around on the refrigerator door. Also, do this before mounting the board to the wall. If you need a small-ish white board somewhere around the home or office, I recommend this one. The board also tends to develop and keep little smudges that look like a dent, scratch, or flaw in the whiteboard. Easy to use, erases cleanly - what more could I want from a white board? This board was the perfect thing to hang over the printer in our small office. There are only 3 of us, so we didn't need a large board to leave each other messages or track weight loss progress or to say where we had gone when we were out of the office, and the price was right. So you have the board with the tape on all four corners. This allows the board to have some clearance in the back and stick perfectly to my refrigerator. The board doesn't slide around the refrigerator when I write on it, and it doesn't slide down on its own due to gravity.It's a dry erase board. When returning board to door after using it in another room...I have to give the magnets a moment to re-bond before opening the door again.I recommend this dry erase board for those with perfectly flat metal surfaces (if using the 4 flat rectangular magnets for mounting). I really like this white board. This board fit the bill. The board erases cleanly, unlike some cheaper cardboard-based ones I've tried.The only con is the fastening. The Quartet Magnetic Dry Erase Board is a cute board that functions well except in one major respect; the magnets supplied with it do not hold it up. The board immediately slid down. The board wipes clean very easily. For a little while I needed a light, portable board to take to French class regularly that I wouldn't mind getting a little banged up in my backpack and this did the trick - after class ended last week I was able to mount it to the wall in about five minutes (after it didn't work on the fridge).My little nieces also like drawing on it, which is a plus.I ended up buying a set of my own markers as I found this one to be rather weak. The board always seems to slide on my file cabinet where I have it mounted. I need a white board - but am not allowed to permanently affix a board to the wall. This board erases well and the use of dry erase board cleaner has not affected its surface even after multiple cleanings. This board is big enough, but not overwhelmingly large. This board is encased in a white plastic frame that is solid and well made.It is a nice size, with plenty of room to write on.

Perfect for this board.

The board itself is decently made, about what you might expect for an item ~ $8.

The board comes with 4 foam stickers manufactured by 3M, and 4 additional magnets depending on how you want to mount the board (metal vs wall).
