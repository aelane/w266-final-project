Nice colors and they drew consistently. The black is black but the other colors are pale versions of the colors and no where near as vibrant as the cap colors. Bright colors that display well on the whiteboard easel I use outside my lab. The colors are bright and they write smoothly and don't dry-up easily. The colors came out vibrant and pure. The primary colors are bright and good way to separate our To-Do lists.... (indoor, outdoor, groceries, etc... )The fine tip is also great for the grandson's dry erasable boards likeMead Letters and Numbers Dry Erase Boards, 12-5/8 x 11-3/4-Inches (54216)orBoard Dudes Wire Bound Dry Erase Activity Book - Cursive and Math/Time (11210UA-4). I really love how opaque the black/blue/red colors are on this set (the green is only tad transparent). There are four colors in pack. The colors are bright and wonderful. The colors are nice and vibrant. Now, if they just came in better, more unique colors and since I have a magnetic white board, if these pens were magnetic, they'd basically be perfect! These colors are darker, there isn't a scent I hate, and the lines are firm. The colors are very vibrant and easy to see once you write on a board with them. They come in assorted colors (4 colors, red blue green black) The flow of the ink is great, and you can see through the barrel to see where the ink gauge is knowing when they are to low. * The colors are vibrant and dark enough that you can see them across the room, even with the fine tips -- and this is true even across all the colors. * All of the colors erase easily from the board, without needing to scrub, and without leaving streak marks. The colors are true to the cap and they are definitely markers I will be using continually. The colors are bright and sharp. The colors all seem bright except for black which is sharp.These have little odor which is a plus for me. They write smoothly and the colors are very bright. The colors are pretty solid except the green, which is actually an aquamarine-ish color.The interesting thing about them, and i don't know if it's a function of the vaunted Liquid Ink, is an almost watercolor-like effect. They are so bright and such vibrant colors. The colors (assorted option) aren't as bold as I may have liked them but they're still good. They write smoothly in bright, vibrant colors.
