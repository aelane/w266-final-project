So I have been printing using this ink set for making cards, printing pictures, and also basic documents. This ink fits into my HP Deskjet 3512 that I use in my home office.What I have found is that this set the HP Genuine 61 Ink Cartridge Combo set does a excellent print job in color realism and vivid prints. This is why I now buy the genuine NEW HP ink, as I get what I pay for...For printing pictures, I must say that I use a high quality picture paper and doing that and this ink has made all the difference.Very pleased and I highly recommend this ink combo set. the ink is working just fine on wifes printer and is ok with it for it comes when we need it I recommend getting more black ink cartridges than color to save on money. The ink I bought was "Sold by Quantum Electronics, Inc. and Fulfilled by Amazon." This is ink for my printer. These ink cartridges are both reliable and useful simply because they work very well with my HP Deskjet 3050 printer. this is the best ink prices to ink page count out there for HP at least. The ink has never &#34;dried up&#34; or clumped or anything. I was definitely impressed with how the ink prints up my projects and resumes bolder than other printers have shown with their ink from Epson to Brother. needed new ink for my printer then the computer went out now need to connect printer to new lap top I found these ink cartridges to be extremely high-quality.
