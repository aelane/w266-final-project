I've wanted a laminator for a long time for craft projects around the house so I was thrilled to receive this product.Starting with the design of the product itself, I like that it is fairly compact and light weight. The Fellowes Saturn 2 95 laminator (9.5 inch) is a solid laminator that is safe, easy-to-use, and creates some great laminated materials.Features at a glance:* 9.5 inch width, which let's you insert a letter size, pictures, A4 size documents* Hot and cold lamination settings* 3 mm or 5mm pouches can be used. After that, it takes the laminator about 5-6 minutes to warm up. I am really happy with this laminator. I have used a laminator before, but the one I had was bigger, and not so convenient to use. Overall, I am impressed by how well this works even though I had never owned a laminator before and there's really no comparison to make. Having never used a laminator before, I had no idea that there were different functions. This Fellowes Saturn laminator is very light weight and compact as compared to other similar products I have used in the past. This laminator works great, especially for the cost. This laminator is super lightweight, and is fast and easy to use at home! I received the Fellowes Saturn 125 laminator for use in my home office, laminating support materials for customer and common reference cards. I gratefully received a Scotch laminator from a friend last year. As advertised, this laminator's exterior remains cool to the touch, so I'm not worried about being burned. Most importantly this laminator does a fine job at laminating. This little Fellowes laminator does the job very nicely and isn't too large that it's a big problem to store like some other laminators I've had. This Saturn laminator is my first-ever personal use home laminator, and I couldn't be happier with the end product this little number creates!Fellowes has made this unit easy all around. This is my first laminator and I have wanted one for a long, long time! This is a great laminator. Kit comes with laminator, instructions, registration card, and 10 3ml laminating pouches. This Fellowes Saturn laminator is so ridiculously easy to use that even if you're technologically challenged you shouldn't have a problem with it. I am impressed with this little laminator. The Fellowes Saturn 2 125 Laminator is a well built laminator that works like a champ for school and office tasks. The laminator does a fantastic job, leaving no air bubbles or ripples, but gives a smooth, professional lamination job time and time again. I have a larger laminator but thought I might try this one. This particular laminator is quite easy to use and it seems very durable. This laminator accepts material of up to 12.5-inch wide, a very nice feature taking it to the offfice use level. It is a sleek and functional laminator. It is a really nice laminator with all the bells and whistles. If you are looking for a decent laminator in a reasonable price, the Saturn2 125 is for you.A
