This printer was easy to set-up, although I did not even try to do the wireless set-up because it seemed too complicated. This printer is a fantastic deal, but just be aware that Brother makes their money on toner, not on the printer. This printer has a side fan that is as loud as a leaf blower! I love this printer. I highly recommend this printer to anyone looking for a good home office personal laser printer. I think I'm going to have to say this is the best printer I've ever used given the price. Nice printer. I ordered this printer at the same time that I ordered an HP Envy printer. Updating the printer drivers was all done without the need for the included CD or any USB cables at all. The last printer I had found all the information it needed all by itself and set up its own wireless. Never did get the printer to go wireless and that is important to me; therefore I was forced to purchase a USB connector because of course there wasn't one included. This printer also has a hard-off switch, which some other printers don't have.~~~ Comments & questions welcome ~~~ (Problem has since been solved as I have moved the printer to a three-pronged grounded outlet. I had my printer up and running on my wireless network in fifteen minutes.Like other Brother printers, the HL2270DW is fairly lightweight, although it feels much more substantial than many single-purpose inkjet printers. Super good printer which prints on both sides of paper and joins your network without cables, all for the cost of taking your wife to dinner at a good restaurant! (Ethernet)Though the printer's wireless abilities are nice to have, I prefer to use the Ethernet connection to plug the printer directly into my wireless router. A printer with WiFi is really only useful if it won't be attached to your router and want it completely independent. The 2270DW still supports the most current PCL printer language, developed by HP. I would personally never buy a GDI-only printer. Lastly, given how recently this printer was released, I'm disappointed they didn't include the better 802.11n Wifi support.NOISEThe 2270DW is noisier than the 2170W, so if you didn't like the 2170W for its noise, then you definitely won't like the noise from the 2270DW. I've had this printer for two months and so far it's performed flawlessly.I've been buying HP inkjets for twenty years and until recently, they were always a safe choice. I needed a printer that was easy to use for everyday printing of letters and envelopes with a special feed for envelopes. This is a great little printer. I was looking for a cheap, small, laser printer and this was my answer. Not only that, the printer drum is only good for 10,500 pages!This is an excellent printer for very occasional use. Nice little printer. This printer has it all - wireless connectivity, Mac-compatibility, duplexing, and a great profile.I've been using the printer for 4 months now without a single glitch. I have had this printer for six months and have not experienced any problems. This printer has worked fabulously at our shop. I love this printer and will be buying it again when it craps out on me (which will hopefully be many years from now). This printer has a couple of quirks that keeps me from giving it five stars, however.Quirk #1:  Whether I'm using Brother brand toner cartridges or third-party cartridges, the printer starts giving "toner-out" warnings long before toner in the cartridge is actually gone. Unless I've gone into the printer's configuration page and set the printer not to stop when it "thinks" that the toner is exhausted, the printer will refuse to make more copies. After the printer prints one side of the paper, it flips the paper into the bottom tray and then prints the other side from that tray. We like this printer well enough to now own two of them. I found the printer from Amazon reviews, I was so tired of paying the price to HP for lame printer drivers and high priced supplies.This printer is great, it starts up fast and is ready to print in about a minute. Good printer for the dollar. I like this printer. Will be ordering a similar Brother printer pretty soon that also prints in color. This printer is not constructed nearly as durably as the old printer, and is a lot slower than the old printer when duplexing. I've had this printer for over a month now, and it has worked flawlessly every time. This printer is 7 times faster than the old one. (The HP had only a Parallel printer port but I had obtained a Parallel to USB cable from Monoprice several years ago since PCs no longer come w. the obsolete Parallel connector.Point one - If you are getting a new printer, get one w. wifi.Point two -  If you do any amount of printing at all, get a laser. This printer cost $99. Shopping for a printer can be frustrating, because there are so many models that are similar. I never have to think about it, and the printer is no longer a clunky object taking up my work space. Fortunately the printer is very simple to use. Good printer but the initial toner lasted less than half of what Brother advertised.Note to Brother: The "ISO" way of measuring things is often not realistic, just like the gas mileage measuring method of new cars. I use aD-Link DIR-655 Extreme-N Gigabit Wireless Router, which is near the printer, and although I've used the printer wireless, I have chosen to keep it hard wired to the router.I have five notebooks that are in use in my house, and the wireless printing is fairly fast. I have been using the printer now for over a month, and would consider purchasing another one if I needed a printer. I expect this printer, with the cost of the printer and toner, to pay for itself within six to nine months with savings in ink cartridges alone.UPDATE 2-26-13:I've been using this printer for over six months now. I have had the printer connected to the network, and no computer has had issues with printing to it, and the printer has always begun printing within ten seconds of executing print on the computer. The printer itself does a good job of staying connected to the wireless network. The printer is a little loud when printing and takes a while to warm up, but my printing needs are pretty infrequent and I don't mind. I'm using this printer with a Mac Laptop running 10.9 (Mavericks), and an older Mac G4 running 10.4. )The printer itself is a bit on the noisy side, but prints literally in seconds. My last ink-jet printer kept asking for new color cartridges even though I never used color and it's very expensive to keep feeding them to the printer. I recommend this printer. I have had this printer for seven months. I had to reinstall the printer software on my wireless laptop, which is running OSX 10.8.5.Surprise #1:  The installation CD would not longer run. The printer worked well up to this point. Use to replace my old lazor printer. That said you can deploy this printer as wireless, network cabled to your router or USB cabled to your router. The printer will now restart.====================ADDENDUM July 3, 2014I recently bought another HL-2270DW. It is a great printer as long as you know the caveats discussed above. Fantastic printer it is amazing what this thing will do, I see features I saw on $5k bucks HPs when I was working years ago. One is the printer manual (140 pages) and a Network manual (50) pages on how to setup wifi. If the printer has a dynamic IP your computer will not find your printer when everything resets or reboots up.There is a online browser menu that allows you to set or change printer parameters. This printer will do a lot of things like offset printing duplex so you can use ring binders (wow).All parts and buttons are explained. The duplex printer mode is  automatic and you don't have to think about it. While this was a good printer while it worked, it died after just about a year with a 'fuser error', which is not worth fixing.I replaced it with the Brother 2240D model, which is cheaper, although not networkable. Great printer! So, I bought the 2270DW.The Brother HL-2270DW is very similar to the earlier printer in size, shape and features. However, this printer is all black rather than grey and white, and it has automatic duplex (double-sided) printing rather than the manual duplex printing that the earlier printer has. This printer is a little noisier than its predecessor, perhaps because of the extra mechanics needed for the automatic duplex printing, but it is not excessively loud. I am very happy with the Brother HL-2270DW printer and recommend it.
