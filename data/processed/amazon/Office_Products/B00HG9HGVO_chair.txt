Once put together the chair can be used for different sitting positions and swings around 360 degrees. Not a bad chair for the price, you'll probably get lots of use out of it. Unlike the GUC chair this back does not pivot at all; it is firm. Just remember that a chair with no arms is meant for use a few hours at a time. This is not a particularly fancy chair, and I was surprised at the high list price, but I was also surprised by how comfortable it is. Still, it's a very good chair for your desktop computer. The chair looks good to my eye. Task chair versus arm chair. I highly recommend this chair! This is a very basic chair. This is a great chair for any home office/dorm. I'm a little worried about the chair wheels damaging or denting the lino, and it's not that I weigh much at 125 pounds, so I'll have to keep an eye on that. I had an ugly and uncomfortable chair at my office so was thrilled to review this.The wide cushioned seat is comfortable and can be adjusted in height. This is a nice chair that put together easily. I have used the chair, and I find it to be supportive and comfortable. The chair is easy to assemble, even for an assembly klutz like me-  about twenty minutes worth of effort. Our chair is on an indoor outdoor carpet and it slides very easily The seat is comfortable enough for up to a couple of hours but eventually we acquired slight fanny fatigue. You can't slouch in this chair. Substantial thought went into making assembly virtually painless.The chair is supported by a five-point base (a safe, anti-tipping design) outfitted with casters. In an inexpensive chair, I didn't expect much, but the mechanism works as well as those on high-end chairs.According to the advertising the chair provides support at a number of critical pressure points. That works well enough, but the chair back is pretty hard, and the edges are rough. It's a comfortable chair that's well designed so it doesn't have any weird pressure areas if you're sitting and working on a project for several hours.It went together easily and quickly. This is my second HON chair and like the first one this one is sturdy and easy to assemble, however, this one came packaged a bit better than my first chair. The first HON chair I reviewed arrived with a good sized hole in the package where one of the legs of the base had poked straight through the box. That didn't happen with this chair which is a plus :) The seat is a bit cushy and wonderful, however the back of this chair is very supportive and made of hard plastic. Overall, it's a nice comfortable chair and smaller than my other HON chair making it a welcome addition to the home office.
