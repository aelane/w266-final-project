Even if you are non-technical, you should be able to set up this binder in under 30 minutes. Something our old binder didnt do. This is a great thermal binder. I use this binder to bind open house phamplets for potential clients, and it just makes my work look more "professional". It beats using a stapler.The binder works relatively fast and your work looks like a book off the store shelves. You can use this binder for anything you want.I highly recommend this product. It's a great binder for the money. I was expecting the binder to use the comb plastic pieces like theFellowes Star Manual Comb Binding Machine. I have never used a thermal binder before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. The binder is easy to use and I must admit the binding is not only well attached but also looks very professional. I tested the Fellowes thermal binder with a  stack of fewer than 30 recipes. I then removed the binder, let it cool for about a minute, and checked the results.On my first two attempts, the Helios 30 made a perfect bind between papers and covers. The binder itself has a measuring device to indicate which cover will be required for the pages to be bound. I was anxious to get this binder and use it in our small office. I already have a Fellowes Pulsar 300 binder, so I was curious how a thermal binder would compare.

I removed the binder and put it on the cooling tray on the unit itself and 20 minutes later I could use the book.Overall I give this unit a 4 out of 5.

Overall I would give this binder a B-.

Use it to create a good-looking binder that lacks the bulk of a ring binder while maintaining a professional appearance.2.
