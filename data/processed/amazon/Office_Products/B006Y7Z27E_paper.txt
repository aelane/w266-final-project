13x19in) is that large paper needs tray 1, but so do nozzle checks (as far as I can tell). I feel like I am constantly adding paper so it would be nice to not have to do that so often. It has 2 paper trays so you can have 2 paper sizes ready at all times. No paper jamming or feeding problems even though I ran several sheets of paper that were damaged/crumpled on the edges for my initial test prints. On longer paper, the printer prints all one side and then signals you to flip the paper and put it back in the tray. That's OK since I don't tend to print on larger paper all that much. Also, on regular paper (not the good stuff) there's definitely some ink bleed through, so I set the printer to draft quality and that makes a big difference. I loaded some plain paper of larger-than-usual size (11x17) and hooked up my USB cable. Both paper trays extend from the unit when they hold paper larger than standard; a plastic cover protects the paper from airborne dust. I found the paper trays to be well-built without the difficulty that I sometimes have adjusting trays to fit various size paper. While I could load photo paper into the smaller HP, its rollers were never up to the task of pulling such heavy weight paper through, something this one does with ease. It turns out if you have small format paper, like 4x6 photo paper it belongs in the top tray. Don't put photo paper on top of regular inkjet printer in the tray, as the last sheet of photo paper will bring a sheet of regular  paper along for the ride resulting in an unwanted printing. "load paper"). Also, you don't have to manually feed the large format paper in - something a lot of the older wide formats required. There are two paper trays, which is great. With the expanded paper tray, it's a BIG footprint.PRINTINGI spent the day printing photos for my daughter's school project. It was plain paper, not photo paper. I also save on paper. It will not work if left to automatically select the paper tray.One thing I did not like is the lack of digital display. Epson has improved the paper trays so that you can easily set the trays to hold the paper you are using snuggly. Depending on the paper sized used, the printer's front-to-rear depth can grow to accommodate the extra paper lengths.The WF-7010 comes with two paper trays; according to some older reviews, the trays cannot both accept the same sized paper, but on mine both trays are identical and can accept any allowed paper size. The paper exit tray pulls out of the front of the printer and telescopes to a maximum that makes the overall printer depth about 27"; if you are not using the largest paper sizes, you don't need to telescope the exit tray so far out. Each paper tray has a retracted mode and an extended mode. And when you are selecting the desired paper size in the driver, it does allow selections of up to 13" x 44", but it does not explain how to feed such a large size as 44". I don't have any long paper handy, so I have not verified this feature.Some other points:- The printer driver auto-selects the correct tray for the paper, as long as you take the time to tall the driver which sizes of paper are inserted into each of the two trays; this is done through the Windows or MAC printer configuration and instructions are included in the user guide. I found the paper quality makes a HUGE difference in printing images with the WF-7010 and especially with color bleeding, more so than with my old HP.
