Best paper cutter ever. I love this paper cutter! - This paper trimmer will cut up to 30 sheets of 20lb paper.- It has a nice non slip handle and a finger rest edge to protect your hand and fingers.- It also has the plastic safety guard to keep your fingers safely away from the cutting area. This also helps with holding down the paper that you are cutting.- The blade is super sharp so be careful! Let's cut some paper!And it comes with 15 year lifetime warranty! But otherwise a very serviceable paper cutter. This is an amazing paper cutter. I have owned a traditional paper cutter for many years. While it cuts paper very easily - and has all the safety precautions that you'd hope a paper cutter would have - I've also been using it to cut perfectly straight greenhouse "H-channels" that connect the panels. And, just like with the paper, this cuts through easily. I really like this paper cutter. This is a great little paper cutter. Not only is this more visible, it also allows one to write on the paper while it's lying on surface of guillotine without grid pattern transfer. It is able to cut straight without ripping the paper with many sheet and with few sheets. I usually trim photo paper that requires precision and clean cut and this trimmer meets my requirements and needs. I could see better where the paper edge lines under the safety guard. I use guillotine paper cutters at work to cut for use in press passes and for use in artistic projects. When you chop paper it has great cutting action and doesn't move around when cutting.There were two things I did not like about this. I didn't believe that paper cutter technology would progress so much over time, but it has. It comes with a clear, plastic paper holder so that when you are lining up the paper, you can hold the paper in place by pressing down on the plastic piece. Sometimes the paper is just a tiny bit too far to the left, so that I don't quite cut the edge. Removing it does make it easier to align and cut paper, but it makes me nervous. I was constantly folding paper at the edge of a table to cut it in half and this trimmer does a much more accurate, neater job.The last time I've used a trimmer was over a decade ago in high school and this trimmer is leaps and bounds ahead of what we used back then.

This paper cutter can handle more than my requisite five sheets, but I probably won't push that envelope too often in my home use of it.

A guillotine-style paper cutter like this is a bulky but useful tool for hobbies and crafts.
