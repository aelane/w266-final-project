We really felt these boxes helped make our move a lot easier (at least the clothes portion) and we will happily recommend them to anyone else looking to move a large amount of clothing. The boxes also relieve the clutter in a big way.The cost of Smooth Move boxes seems to be MUCH more reasonable than purchasing them at a storage store, too. These are serious moving boxes. The boxes are well made, although the cardboard itself seems to be a bit thinner than what you can get from the national chain moving company places. The boxes are folded twice when they are packed and it seems you give up some sturdiness in the corners to accommodate the needs of getting this packaged and shipped to you. The boxes I received had a good deal of moisture - now that the boxes have dried up the cardboard has regained some of its original strength. I am very satisfied with the boxes they are sturdy and include the hanging bar. For us, three boxes held all my husband's clothes and all my summer clothing (winter clothes like sweaters and coats bulk these up too quickly, so I recommend using thinner items just for the sake of efficiency). These boxes are very easy to assemble, they hold a LOT of clothes (I could fit about 20 pieces per box) and they are very strong, which means that the clothes inside are well-protected during your move.My only criticism would be that the price seems a little excessive for what is, after all, a cardboard box (albeit a very well-constructed cardboard box).I've gotta say, though, these puppies were mighty useful during my move! These boxes are pretty huge. Otherwise, the boxes seem sturdy and roomy for just about any clothing. Comparatively, these boxes are about average. I love this Wardrobe Box, unlike the other boxes they manufacture, Banker Box failed to provide instructions but no worries, it wasn't a challenge to figure out.My selection of this item was to store expensive formal wear. The boxes weathered the trip in the moving van fairly well. Unfortunately the SmoothMove Wardrobe boxes will be cut up and placed in recycling instead. The boxes showed wear and tear, some were slightly dented (crushed) but the contents were fine. These are fantastic boxes! I used one of these boxes to store all my vintage clothes, hanging them up, and putting mothballs inside. These boxes are very flexible and roomy and great to store items you don't use all the time, thus freeing up valuable closet and door space. The boxes aren't super tall so they are best suited for just about any garment except those that are longer than a large man's sport coat. The boxes are two feet wide, and make use of a heavy duty steel cross bar that is designed to hold more weight without bending than the box itself could even handle. You can use it to store the three boxes!- This set comes with three boxes, each with a two-foot hanging width. These are good, sturdy boxes...not flimsy cardboard, but thick and made to take weight, moving around and a few dings. Other than that, these boxes are pretty much what you'd hope for! These are great little boxes to move (or store) clothing on hangers in. Because these boxes have a bar, you can hang all of the out-of-season clothes and store them away. Love these boxes! It's really difficult to find nice, new, clean boxes in which to store linens and/or clothing.I had been using and reusing wardrobe boxes from the 'truck moving place' for years. Very well made boxes. Since these moving boxes come in packages of three, it would be tempting to think that three boxes will take care of a closet six feet wide, but, if you've lived in the same space a long time, it is likely that your closet is packed close. I had SmartMove boxes before and have been completely satisfied with it.

I was forced to assemble these boxes in a different room first.

If you want these expensive boxes to last, I recommend loading them up, and then then perhaps taking 2-5 items out to loosen the load on each bar/box.

These boxes are more solid than the kind we can get from our local movers.
