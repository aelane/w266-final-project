After unpacking this printer, I set it up and input my Wifi name and password before installing the driver disk. The printer also auto-enlarges some documents for you. The printer is easy to setup. This printer isn't made for the occasional user, so keep that in mind.The scanner is slow, but not as slow as I had anticipated based on other reviews. This isn't a cheap printer, and much lower priced printers come with Airprint.If you choose to get this and still need to print from your iPad or iPhone, there are a few apps out there that you can get for under $10 that will communicate with this and any other wireless printer, with or without having to go through your computer. It works great with this particular printer. )It's a nice compact printer, but Epson's "Better than Laser" pitch doesn't fly.- - - Ink Cost: It Adds Up - - -Over 5 years, you could pay $480 to $1000+ in supply costs. If you never use the printer past 24,000 copies, your actual cost per page would be 3.1 / 2.0 / 0.6 / 0.5 cents.Supply prices are average amazon prices for Jan - March 2013, sales tax not included.Note SB2:-----------Speed tests do not include set-up time for the first page.The test page was a busy landscape-mode page with lots of size 9 font text and a 5" x 6" graphic. This is a reasonably priced, reliable printer for home use.Back to the Epson WorkForce WF-M1560. Yes, I do like this printer. If you are expecting more from this printer than it was designed for you&#8217;ll be disappointed. Remember, DON&#8217;T connect your printer to your PC. This printer has a scanning resolution of 1200 dpi (main scan) and 2400 dpi (sub scan). This printer uses a standard USB printer cable, so you could use the old one off of an old printer if you have one laying around. I like this printer very much. It was as quick as any other printer I've owned when it came to printing pages off the computer. The printer itself takes up very little space and I have a small office and desk table so printer size is important. If you're looking for an economical printer for everyday use, this should fit the bill. After the printer setup the installer checked for firmware updates automatically - another nice feature.Other than printing the test page, the first thing I had the printer do was make a copy with the ADF. I really love this little printer. I was looking for an economical printer. This printer, after the upfront cost of it, is definitely a money-saver. This printer is designed to produce sharp laser quality text, which is ideal for reports and everyday printing. This is wireless printer and it also works with a direct Ethernet connection to the network. We were hoping that this printer could replace our aging HP Laserjet 2100 and help us move to a paperless home office for all our Macs. Rebooting the printer doesn't help. This is a great printer if are replacing a standard printer and are looking for a small unit that provides fast wireless printing, copying, scanning and faxing options. As a standard printer it's great. If you need a printer to print promotional pieces, flyers,etc. The printer works well with both operating systems.- Copy feature works well.- The scanning feature is a bit slow, but nothing to complain about. You can also fax from your printer if you have a modem- The printer is fast, especially when you set it to normal or draft.- The built-in WiFi works seamlessly. My older printer takes a long time to shut down and restart.- The buttons are a bit flimsy. Hopefully, I'll be proven wrong.Overall, this is a great printer for everyday use. The printer is compact and has the ability to scan, fax, and copy.W
