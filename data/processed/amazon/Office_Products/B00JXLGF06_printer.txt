The printer simply shuts off till I replace the cartridge, also flashing an urgent message on my monitor. "The Epson is also my printer for reusing paper already printed on one side with the Xerox. It pays to buy another printer that costs more money. I cannot believe how much printer one can get these days for the price. This printer is a real deal and highly recommended. Not a large printer, it measures 19.2 X 21.1 X 12.9. The printer MUST sit firmly on a hard surface; otherwise the paper tray may get into a bind and be hard to close.The set up was easy, however like many electronic gadgets and computers items the written instruction that at one time filled pages are no longer given with the printers. The printer comes with a DVD which will direct you to an update download for the operation and drivers. If you have only this printer as a printer and you can go wireless I personally think that would be the way. The printer also has Wi Fi and you can therefore print from your iPad if you have Wi Fi set up in your location.The scanner is a flat bed type with 2400 dpi resolution. The printer comes with very minimal paperwork.I think after &#8220;playing&#8221; around with the black and white resolution and the color resolution I can get the printer to working closer to laser quality however for now it is being used as just another printer. The printer comes with four standard ink cartridges, however please note that the initial charge of the printer took up a large percentage of that ink, thus I don&#8217;t expect to get the full number of printed sheets from those cartridges. This is an impressive printer. The printer also uses the 252 series DURABrite ink cartridges.So, there has been slight upgrade for pages printer per minute.Also, included is a 35-page duplex auto document feeder to quickly copy, scan or fax stacks of 1 or 2-sided documents.For fax, you can fax documents directly to/from your computer and high speed faxing in black and color as fast as 3 seconds per page, speed dial storage up to 100 numbers plus fax memory up to 180 pages.EPSON Connect allows for convenient mobile printing from smartphones, tablets and more.These new Epson WorkForce WF-3620/3640 printers now feature PrecisionCore technology which offers print-shop quality, faster printing and saving ink by 40 percent compared to color laser. But this printer does allow for wireless, USB and ethernet for those wanting to add a network printer.NOTE: A USB printing Cord is not provided, so you will need to use your old printer USB cord, or USB that came with an older external CD/DVD/HD drive or purchase a USB printer cord for a direct connection.The device does come with a phone cord for fax use.II. Other than that, this printer is quite magnificent, I was able to print, copy, fax, scan with ease.As mentioned earlier, what I love about the recent WorkForce printers is the way it uses paper and loads, unlike many other cheaper printers in which paper gets stuck and you get the awful paper jam, I never had to worry about it with these type of printers. A wonderful printer for its price and functionality, but I really do recommend also checking out the Epson WorkForce-7610/7620 printers if you are able to spend an extra $50. The printer actually fits in a drawer on my computer desk. This is another solid printer from Epson. The printer feels solid, the trays are well-designed (some are flimsy and easily broken), and the cartridge tray holds the cartridges snug. Wow, what a printer! I chose this printer mostly because of the features like wireless printing, high-quality ink and the compact size. My other printer was way too big and heavy, but this one isn't bad to move around when needed. The printer has auto 2-sided print, copy and faxing as well.Epson has a comprehensive online user guide so you can see the many things you can do with this printer. If you want a higher-volume printer, get an inkjet with a higher paper capacity or go with a laser printer. An excellent printer for home or a small business, the "Epson WorkForce WF-3620 Wireless and WiFi Direct All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer" is a terrific choice for those in need.Among its many attributes: standard printing is fast; text and image quality is excellent, with great color saturation; paper feed holds 250 pages; automatic duplexing on both the printer and the 35-sheet automatic document feeder is convenient; automatic two-sided printing; copy image quality is strong (if slighlty under saturated); built-in fax and email capability is sweet; although not touted by Epson, photo printing is excellent; both a touchscreen and number button interface are available; a media card slot is available for direct printing; and there is ethernet, USB and Wi-Fi connectivity for tablet, PC, Mac and smartphones.In fact, the only minor drawbacks I find are the size (while certainly not as big as some office-oriented printers, it's still pretty big; those looking for a compact printer for home use should look elsewhere) and its lack of CD/DVD printing capability.Four ink cartridges are required to print (black, yellow, magenta, cyan), while ink prices are pretty standard for Epson: $13 for each standard color cartridge, yielding 360 pages; XL color cartridges yield 1,100 pages for $30; $20 for standard black cartridges, yielding 350 pages; XL black cartridges yield 1,100 pages for $35.In all, this is among the most impressive Epson printers I have yet used (I currently own three), and is a great overall choice for those in the market, especially at its current price point. The printer installed very easily onto the network over ethernet (it also has wireless built in). This is a not throw away printer nor has high ink costs.Physically it is a little big though it does not have the bigger paper tray like the 3640, and really not needed.-Physical size is big and heavy but super sturdy - you can feel the quality-Set up is a breeze-Wifi set up was flawless-Mac and Windows wireless connections were perfect-Picture prints are pretty quick but no super quick but crystal clear-Document printing both color and BW are crisp and fast-Document scanning via Adobe is greatHighly recommended and worth the investment for several years. This printer was easy to set up &#8211; the step by step instructions were well-written and easy to follow. The printer inks (4) come in vacuum packed wrapping for optimal performance. I am very, very pleased with this printer and can highly recommend it for anyone and everyone from personal printer to small business needs. I chose already connected and it found the printer , installed the software and again printed a test page.The scanner is quick, as was the copy functionThe print quality is excellent even on plain paper.I probably wont use some of the more advanced functionality but it's nice to know it's available if I need it in the future.I need to do some research on my phones to see if I can use the fax function.It's well built for an ink jet in it's price range.Recommended! The printer design is very good provided you have front access to the panel. This is the perfect printer. When you first turn it on, the printer initializes and then tells you to install the ink. It also assigns your printer an email address so you can print things by emailing them. This is a great printer for home use.Notes:- Touchscreen is awesome and makes it easy to use- Compact size- Paper cartridge keeps paper nice and flat- Software setup is quick and easy.- Wi-Fi setup is a breeze- Can set up Epson Connect so you can email things to print to your printer- Can set up a mobile app to print to your printer- Can set up scanner to scan to the could. Just select it from the printer properties inside whatever program you are printing from. My first printer, which I bought in the 90s, was an Epson and I've been a loyal fan of the brand ever since. I don't think this printer would disappoint anyone, and it's a model that I would recommend to my family. This printer set up quickly and easily. I highly recommend this printer. So while I wouldn't classify it as a portable printer per se, the weight is manageable enough that you could take it with you on occasion. Don't turn the printer off during this time.Next, install the printer software and drivers. This is a reliable, all-in-one printer from an established manufacturer. I had initially set the printer with regular economy paper.
