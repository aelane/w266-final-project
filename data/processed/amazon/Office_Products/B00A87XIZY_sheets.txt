It feels thicker than sheets we use in my workplace. 100 8.5&#34;x1&#34; 7mil plastic sheets with sheets of tissue between each sheetnothing else, no holes in sheet, and no binder clipsThe sheets themselves are apparenty intended to be non glare are they are not crystal clear. You are buying the sheets, not the box but you may want something better to store 100 sheets.Also the sheets are easily scratched. Just sliding other cover sheets or binders over it will cause some light scratches. But these turned out to be only plastic sheets. Although the plastic sheets are think (7 MIL), as I mentioned, these do get scratches very quickly so if you&#8217;re looking for something that is more scratch-resistant, this product might not be what you need. The top and bottom sheets in the pack show more scuff than the rest, probably having encountered a bit of shuffling before packing. These sheets are substantial, they are crystal clear and they look like they will last a while! They are protective sheets, useful as front and back covers for protecting documents that are either held together either with a binder clip or a binding machine.They aren&#8217;t hole punched, but they can be, so they could be used to protect papers in a three-ring binder as well.They are fairly thin and flexible, but seem to be quite durable. These sheets will work for these purposes, but you will need to purchase binding products separately. I like how they packaged the sheets as well; with a tissue between each one; to prevent scratches. The 100 sheets are well packed and have tissue between each sheet. Although not as I expected, these 100 sheets will get tons of use in my house! The sheets are clear plastic and are thicker than I thought they would be. Also, some of my sheets were heavily scratched despite having tissue paper between them to protect them. They are individual sheets and come 100 to a box.
