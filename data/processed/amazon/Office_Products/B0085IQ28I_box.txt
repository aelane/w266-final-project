It became a firm black box, ready for documents and storage.The &#34;up to&#34; 750 documents won't include file folders, but it would hold well over a ream of paper. A box. The box is not expandable as stated in any way, shape or form. I look at my box and all the faded spots of black gone just make the product look cheap. This is a 3" box that can fit inside a file cabinet drawer. I can pull this box out of the drawer to work on those three files together as kind of a portable mini file cabinet. The box wrap is another $7.My conclusion is that it is a great item and for what it does it does well, but I wouldn't pay this price for it. This box arrives as a flattened piece of cardboard that you have to unfold into a box. I like this box, but I feel it is way overpriced. I currently own this box and really like it:Oxford Decoflex Black 12 1/4 x 6 x 9 1/2 Inch Desktop File (23013) The box is strong and fits many manila folders as well as binders. The box is also portable with build in handles. I recommend this box for any type of filing you may have. This box is made to then slip into another case if you purchase that separately.It just pops open so it's easy to use. So far, I only have one box so I'm still experimenting on how to make this idea work for me. The box is handy enough to hold the magazines I have for a research project. This box is definitely made to be used inside a larger box, as one of several smaller file boxes with something around it to hold it in place. I like to keep a box for things on my desk that are bothering me. I compared it to another box of this type that I have, one that ended up as a catchall in a drawer and realized it is not stronger. This box does do what it claims to do: holds files and papers,but the manufacturing of the box is surprisingly unsturdy. This box is part of a "system" that includes MO kits and/or case wraps, but are purchased separately. It's all safely in the box, it fits perfectly and I love that I can keep it all organized in one spot. The box looks great. So I opened it to make the box shape and one of the bottom seams had been badly glued and popped open. The box is sturdy enough, but you do have to have some weight in it for the bottom to sit flat. So this is a nice box. Are you kidding me?Set up was easy - but it is a box and it should be easy. The box is also more of a parallelogram than a rectangle because it won't quite stay unfolded.The description on Amazon is wrong at this time: it doesn't expand except from flat to unfolded. Since the box is all scratched up (and singed), I'm just going to use it in the front of the file cabinet drawer to hold supplies. The box itself looks okay and the cardboard is reasonably sturdy but to me the price is too high, hence my lukewarm review. This is a great box to have. So, when you try to grab the box by the cutouts/handles, one side closes in and the other side stays upright and your fingers barely even reach to both sides. This is an okay box. Actually you just need to unfold it and it become a box. Folding it from flat into the box shape was not very straightforward, though, so -1 star for that.I
