This is a great little scale. I could not correct my scale and bought a new UltraShip scale. The scale must be powered OFF. I would not recommend this scale at all. Why I love my scale:* can weigh stuff in the ounce range all the way up to about 50 pounds* has handy tare and hold buttons. I received this UltraShip 55Lb scale as a gift about 3 years ago and never had any problems with it. I compared this scale to the stamps.com scale I have and this scale is right on as far as weight goes. I'm very happy with this scale and would buy this again well worth the money. This scale is an incredible bargain at the sale price of under $35 including shipping. This is exactly what I wanted, an accurate scale that has the capacity to weigh any package I'm ever likely to ship anywhere, but is sensitive enought to weigh a single letter so I can penny pinch on postage. I bought this scale to use for buying postage and mailing small packages from home. Once calibrated it could be a very nice scale for the money. Anyway, this scale measures in pounds, pounds and ounces, ounces, grams, and kilograms.
