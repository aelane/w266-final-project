Great address label. They are a LITTLE small - but they are return address labels, so not the end of the world, we just used a smaller font and no photograph and all was well. These address labels are just OK, they work better off the computer than on it. Naturally, they can also be used as mailing address labels, albeit small ones as each label is 1/2" x 1 3/4". They are great for printing multiple address labels at home with your computer. They are what they say they are, return address labels. I print my own address, return address & miscellaneous labels.Pros:-they're a few dollars cheaper than Avery-they're compatible with Avery Dennison, Microsoft Word and Print Shop, just to name a few-3M is a well known brand-they stick well, as of now (haven't tested long term)Cons:-none at this time These are standard address label sheets for laser printer use. If you have a long address you'll need a small font... and you'll want to be sure your printer is well-aligned since there's no space between labels and no room for error. But they are so small I can't see how they could be used as address labels, return or otherwise. I created my address labels put in the sheet & hit print. Exactly what I want in address labels. I also don't prefer the free address labels that come to my mailbox from various solicitors. Its an address label, you print your address on it and mail it. Don't plan on putting your whole address on these labels unless you don't add any spaces. Not only could I only get that minor address but I could only get that address if I used the "8" font size. So far, I've used them for my own personal address labels, and also for my condo homeowners association return address labels (I'm the treasurer, so I have to pay bills and mail checks ... ). I actually use return address labels as often for envelopes as I do for labeling things around the house. I really needed some new address labels and these fit the bill. I love not having to write an address anymore. (I've put the address in the comments section since Amazon disallows hyper links in review). What can one say about address labels? I thought the address you type into the space is supposed to fit automatically into the label when you choose the correct label number. If your address is particularly long, try using a narrower font, or condense the font manually in your word processing or layout program.I downloaded the template from 3M's web site and it worked perfectly with OpenOffice.Even though these labels are meant to be used in a laser printer, I found that they work well in my inkjet printer. They are small, so if you have a long address, there isn't room for any design or embellishment next to the text.Other brands make them in this size too, but they are too small in my opinion.

I ordered these because I really LOVE the 3M address labels because they glide through my finicky printer and use my previously installed Avery template.

They are actually return address labels and do measure .5 X 1.75 inches.

Don't know how much I can say about address labels.
