The keyboard wrist pad is 3 1/2" by 18". Both keyboard and mouse wrist rests are easily removable (they just sit on the board) to allow for deep keyboards that have their own rests, or for the use of a trackball mouse.Plus, the entire thing not only adjusts for height, but for tilt. Nor is it made for a larger gaming keyboard or an oversized ueberkeyboard. Anything larger and the keyboard would be hanging off the sides. The keyboard is incredibly versatile in terms of positioning. It is really nice to be able to adjust the keyboard to a comfortable position on the days when my carpal tunnel is acting up - or my Kindle thumb is painful! This is a solid keyboard tray. My keyboard fit on the new tray, and my desk has much more room for other items.I'm finding the new keyboard tray much handier to use as it is lower than my desktop. With my gaming keyboard (additional set of 18 keys on left side) the Fellows keyboard wins out for versatility. One for the keyboard and one for the mouse. There are keyboard and mouse pads included with a sticky back side.The directions are reasonably good if you can follow the pictorial diagrams. The keyboard tray tilts and adjusts to about any required position. I have used other keyboard trays over years, some are more fancier than this Fellowes Professional Series Compact keyboard tray. But I think this Fellowes' keyboard tray is one at the top of the list.First of all, the attached instruction sheets are very clear with pictures showing where to position the tray, where to drill the holes and which screws to be used for each hole. I highly recommend this keyboard. I have had this keyboard  tray for a while now. I would recommend that before you buy this keyboard tray you make sure that your desk has sufficient leg room as the key board does take up some space under there. I also have an ergonomic keyboard and it just fits on my current desks drawer. I didn't know how bad it was until I got this keyboard tray. This compact keyboard tray is a much welcomed addition to my desk. I have a small Bluetooth keyboard and a wireless mouse (although keyboard trays hide wired keyboard and mice nicely). Bottom pads help ensure that the keyboard does not slide around needlessly. I can use it with my Dell keyboard and have tried it with my small Mac keyboard. I love this keyboard tray and its' comfort, but there are two little problems that might steer you away from buying this, the first being that the entire setup weighs about 35+ lbs , and if your desk is not sturdy or if it is made out of particle board it might not be strong enough to hold it. The second being, that compared to some of the other keyboard trays that I have used and assembled the difficulty of putting this together is somewhat more time consuming  and difficult. The keyboard tray will lift and adjust to just about any typing style; which is a plus for me. I have used many keyboard trays that are so flimsy they make typing a chore as they wiggle and slide around while in use. It works OK as a keyboard tray for compact keyboards. It isn't bad overall but the keyboard tray was horrible. The keyboard I was using on it was a compact keyboard, so if you have one of the ones with the built in wrist rest, you might need to check the size to make sure it will fit. The keyboard extends over into the mouse pad sections. The keyboard tray moves effortlessly, yet you never get the sense it's in any way weak or overly dampened. This is a very sturdy keyboard tray. This is a well-built, and extremely stable keyboard tray. I installed this keyboard tray on a fairly sturdy corner table top/computer desk. The keyboard was also taking up valuable work space.I love assembling things so it was a wonderful treat attaching all the hardware to the underside of my table. Summary: Slim, Solid keyboard tray with decent quality and very easy install. When fully stowed, the keyboard tray is almost invisible and completely under the desk.T
