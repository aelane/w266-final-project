I've always preferred working with a mouse. I find it to be excellent - the mouse tracks well, the pad stays put, and the large size means I don't have to hunt for the mouse pad.Design:The pad is about two and a half times as large as a normal pad - about 11 X 13 inches. If you're using a mouse over a glass table or a smooth surface this cloth mouse pad will improve your precision. It is not a "padded" mouse pad although it has a non slip backing. It should really be called a mouse surface rather than pad.Even for my non-gaming mouse, I noticed improved precision and the large surface meant I did not keep coming off the edge of the surface like with traditional square mouse pads. So it's a mouse pad. I've always used a traditional mouse pad and a gel wrist rest...  often hitting the edge of my mouse pad when mousing... I doubt I'll go back to the smaller mouse pads that I used to use... Standard mouse pads aren't too small exactly, but it's nice to never get so close to the sides of the mouse pad or need to recenter the mouse. My mouse movement is more accurate than ever. This mouse pad from Logitech is very similar to the Steel Series pads in almost every way, maybe slightly thinner (which isn't a bad thing, nor a definite pro). It's very large, which means your mouse doesn't run off the edge of the mat when you're in the middle of a crazy boss fight. The mouse glides very smoothly across the surface of the mouse pad without getting caught or stuck.

This mouse pad works great for my needs (Web browsing, MMORPG's, and the occasionally FPS).

The Logitech G240 Cloth gaming mouse pad has a good feel, stays in place, and allows for maneuverability during gaming sessions.I primarily play FPS games like Battlefield 4 and Left 4 Dead.

I wanted to try this mouse pad out for graphics (photo editing, vector graphics, and so forth).
