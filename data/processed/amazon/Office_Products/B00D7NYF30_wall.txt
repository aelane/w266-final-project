We mounted it on the wall the the attached hardware, and it's very easy to see what our schedule is like for the day/week. It was easy to put on the wall and fits right in. I like it on the wall,I can see the appointments and important dates at a glance. Easy to clean.Hanging on the wall was a bit tricky due to needing screws/nails in the wall, but I figured it out.Very nice board. This is a fairly solidly built wall calendar, with space for four months of planning. It doesn't seem like it's designed to be secured to the wall with adhesive mounts, and there's no good place on there to attach adhesives if you wanted to. I had mine up on the wall in less than 5 minutes. It was easy to mount on the wall. It went up very easily on the wall using screws and anchors (I supplied those) and didn't require using peel off tape, I am very pleased.

I like that it's not overly heavy and that I can remove it from or place it back on the wall with little issue if I need to do so.

When I first placed this on the wall, it took just a few minutes before my teenager daughter and her friends started writing important dates- senior ball, graduation, summer camp and finals week- across the board.Immediately, my husband and younger daughter wanted one too!

It is thin so it doesn&#8217;t protrude very far from the wall.
