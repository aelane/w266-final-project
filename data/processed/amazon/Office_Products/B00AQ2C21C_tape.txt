If this tape could be offered in a 3.1-mil thickness with a stickier adhesive that grips cardboard better, then I would have rated this 5 stars instead of 4 stars. I will really enjoy using this "FRAGILE HANDLE WITH CARE" tape...I appreciate everything that makes my life easier! This "Fragile" printed tape does a good job of getting the message across on your shipping package. The tape is thin. It's similar to the printed USPS tape at the post office. As purely decorative tape to mark a package as fragile this is perfect. We can only hope...and this tape works well for mailing packages and hopingWe used this recently to move and label boxes that needed to be placed on top or handled more carefully. Perhaps they're trained to ask but this tape should be obvious to anyone who's not blind. I was excited to see tape with FRAGILE on it since we mail packages often. However, I have to say the tape may be a little too fragile itself. It reminds me of the tape that the USPS provides you for priority mail packaging. This tape indicates in bright red letters that the package is fragile. I was impressed with this tape and I'll probably buy some more when my roll runs out. The tape is easier to get the edge started to unroll even after you have the first part off of it. I love this tape! Also the tape has just enough glue to hold my packages closed. It is quality tape and not cheap tape. I do like the 3M tape, but not quite as much as the other one. It is, however, a good tape to use if you are shipping material you don't want damaged. If you are moving, this would be a perfect tape you use. This is a tape that is not meant to seal, but rather to make people aware of the contents. This is a good tape, but keep in mind its purpose and limitations and you'll like it. The tape is thin and flimsy and I wouldn't trust it to close boxes without double or triple sealing it if I was actually going to ship it. If the tape were thicker and had a more eye catching contrast it would be a better deal but for now I'm sticking, pardon the pun, to packing tape and using a series of high contrast orange and black stickers to warn that packages are fragile Very decent tape you'd expect from a brand name like Scotch. While this tape obviously cost more than basic tape its worth the money in that it saves time and works better than a stamp (where you often end up with "FR----E" stamped on the box since the cardboard often bends inward when you press on the stamp) or writing FRAGILE by hand two/three/four times.It seems to work fine on a tape dispenser and we have had no problems with restarting, it does have a starter tab on the new roll which makes starting easy. As tape goes, this particular line of Scotch "Fragile" tape is thin. But because of how thin it is, it's not really useful as packing tape on its own.As an eBay & Etsy seller, I was hoping that this stuff could replace regular packing tape... but it can't. Great tape that is sticky/strong enough to use a your regular tape for sealing up boxes and the red on white lettering really stands out. This tape makes it easily to add the fragile warning to the packaging in bold red letters. This Scotch tape is a very thin tape that is fairly adhesive but doesn't have a whole lot of tensile strength - it's akin to some of the really flimsy packing tape you'll find for $1 a roll.As such, it's not really something you should be using to tape up a box. As tape itself, it's rather expensive for what you get.4 stars. The tape is VERY thin and easily torn... when I cut it and then try to start another piece, it often does that annoying thing where you get about 3/4s of the width of the tape, but the last 1/4 is left on the roll and you have to keep playing with it to get the whole piece of tape together.Aside from that, it's fine and the red lettering shows up nicely. I used to believe that all packing tape was well packing tape and pretty equal in quality. I used my no-name, generic (think cheapest tape you can find at the local big box office store) and the newly received Scotch tape.Generic tape:  tore easily using my handsScotch tape: could not tear this tape with my hands, had to use a box cutterGeneric tape:  kinked and tore while trying to seal boxScotch tape: came off smooth and kink freeGeneric tape: had to use more tape to seal the box because some of the tape was not tacky enough or tore halfway through putting it on boxScotch tape: one piece of tape across box was sufficient so less tape was used to seal boxOverall, the Scotch tape beat the snot out of the generic brand tape in all categories. Using less tape also makes the tape nearly equal in cost to the generic brand. I found this tape to be `just right' in the sticky department. Although the tape feels thinner than the clear scotch brand I often use, the strength seems to be there. And even though the tape is not completely opaque, the FRAGILE printing shows up just fine. The tape is surprisingly strong and is thick enough not to stick to itself and become a mess when adding a lot of it to your shipments. This tape is opaque white with large red letters FRAGILE HANDLE WITH CARE. Personally, I use my free USPS Priority Mail tape to seal the box and this tape as a label. I will say, though, that this tape seemed like a much better idea in the abstract than it does now that I have it in front of me. The tape itself is thin but strong and has excellent adhesive properties. The tape has a nice, smooth feel to it and the roll has a generous length. I found this tape fairly thin and flimsy. Not sure how much one can say about tape...it does its job. The tape is thin, and the adhesive is not particularly strong. This tape is not as strong as regular packing tape and is noticeably thinner. This tape says "fragile" on it and as such, provides a warning to handlers that the contents are breakable. Yes, you can get packing tape pretty cheaply at most dollar stores, but none of it is nearly as good as the Scotch product. This tape is thin yet strong, and has an aggressive adhesive that is not going to come loose in transit-you can't say that about the cheaper tape. This "FRAGIL HANDLE WITH CARE"  2 inch wide tape is actually 1-7/8 inches wide. This is well made warning tape. If you used this special tape as your primary means of sealing packages, the added expense would quickly outweigh the benefits. The tape is very sticky and holds well once applied. I love multi-tasking.This tape cuts out one more step when we box up items for Flip Flop Spanish. Will definitely make this my "go-to" tape for the future. It's simply packing tape with the message Fragile Handle with Care printed on it. This tape is big and bold and attention getting. Therefore, why would you want to use it as your primary tape? I hate cheap tape. Scotch electric tape is the best. This Scotch Box Sealing tape works very well but not as thick and tough as the standard (non-print) version. However this tape works well even if you have nothing in the box that technically is "fragile". It's tape! This is a handy tape to have on hand for packaging breakable objects and not having to write "Fragile" all over the box.--The tape itself is of standard thickness (it's not heavy duty, but it's not the really thin cheap tapes you see at dollar stores).--The tape is semi-clear, milky-white but see-through, not opaque. I just wanted to be extra sure the tape was secure.The tape does appear to be lightweight and it does 'stick to itself' easy if a long piece is cut off the roll, but the convenience of it outweighs that because I used to print out the word FRAGILE in bold, large letters and tape that to every side of a box. This tape alleviates that and for that alone I will always have a roll on hand.I actually received a package in the mail yesterday that had this tape around it and it arrived without any damage or peeling to it.This tape is a great idea and a very useful one! The tape stuck very well, even when we allowed the boxes to get damp. You use the tape as you would any typical packing tape, but this time you automatically end up with the FRAGILE label because it is part of the tape. It is relatively light-weight tape and probably is best with items that aren't extremely heavy. This tape very quickly sticks to itself and will not unstick. Masking tape does a better job for sealing.So- if you want to call attention to something that is fragile this is good for that, but it really would need a dispenser in order not to waste a great deal of it when it starts adhering to itself.
