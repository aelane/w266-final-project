The Epson printer didn't bother with any of that. This is not the printer you want to get for printing out your prize artwork or presentation to Warren Buffet. Unpacking the printer and removing all the tape and plastic protecting in during shipping actually took longer than the set up. First of all, this is a HUGE printer. You only need to hook up the printer to a network if you're printing from a wired computer. This printer is fantastic! I love this printer. What makes this printer so great is the fact that I can print from my phone, my tablet and my laptop. This printer is an amazing deal for the price! Or use a printer cart. It easily removes and inserts into the printer body.6. I used the &#34;let printer decide&#34; settings for color management.
