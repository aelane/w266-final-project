The size of these boxes are perfect for so many household items and a package of 20 which is how they are sold is nice. Also, the size could be awkward to pick up and transport. But seriously, these are a very nice size...easy to pop into place or break down again for storage when not in use. The size is convenient for things that aren't too dense (so choose something else for items like books, dishes, etc; this box would be better for lighter things). I find this size of box the most helpful in general for moving. The size is right for general household items as long as they are packed rationally, and they can be stacked easily in your storage space.&#9670; Likes:+ 18x18x16-inch medium size boxes; room indicator is quite useful+ Sold and shipped in bundles of 20; very convenient+ Good for general household items; kitchen & bathroom goods+ 32 ECT Construction; 40-60% recycled materials&#9670; On the Fence: May be a bit thin for some household items. This size also stacks well if your books need to be in storage for awhile.11/28/2013 These are really ideal size moving boxes, and the &#34;check off&#34; room identification is a real plus (also, it's clear and bold). It is very sturdy.Given the size, it will be awkward to handle if filled with heavy items, so it probably would be best to use with nothing that will weigh over twenty or so pounds once the box is fully packed. I like the size of these boxes. The size is great and the quality is good enough. It is sturdy, but not that sturdy.The size is good for objects that are not heavy weight, unless you put them on the bottom and lighter weight objects on top. This is a nice size box for medium to light weight objects.I've found this to be a perfect size to store some of the toys that my grandchildren have outgrown or grown tired of.

They are the perfect size (medium) for moving without being to heavy and bulky for me to carry...I am an older single woman, healthy but not a powerhouse.

They are generally a great size for everything.
