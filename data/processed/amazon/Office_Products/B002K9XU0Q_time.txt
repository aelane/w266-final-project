Every time I try to cull/clean up my file cabinet, I find I have duplicate folders, and this way, you can just peel off the new label rather than ending up with several layers of labels when you want to reuse file folders. It's time to do some serious label replacing in our file drawers. Each time they stuck on tight but peeled off easily. Then the next time you're good to swap out the label. When it's time to remove these labels they come off cleanly.Since they're file folder labels, I thought it only fitting that I test them out on our paper files. This is my first time using labels in my printer, which uses a bottom tray. Over time I imagine the likelihood of a tear to something delicate is possible. At the time of this update in mid June, Avery labels are the least expensive at 1.03 cents a label. When the time comes to buy more file folder labels, I will definitely get these again.

At this time, I'm very pleased with how well they do the job.

I thought I'd give these some time before posting a review, to see how well they held up.
