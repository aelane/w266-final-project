It's a basic, no-frills mouse pad. If that is what you are looking for then this is your mouse mat! If you are looking for a mouse pad, don't bother buying the more expensive ones, this one does just fine. It just acts like a mouse pad, presuming that this is just what you want. I have my mouse pad holder mounted to the left side of my KB on a center desk drawer and this pad nicely covers the whole surface and isn't to thick as my old one was. This mouse pad works well with any type of mouse I tried and any brand of mouse I tried! First, I tried the MS Wireless Mouse and the mouse moved so well over this pad. The Verbatim mouse moved very well over this pad. Look no further, this is the mouse pad I suggest to you. What's not to like about a mouse pad that does its job without eating the mouse? I ordered 5 because I can never find a mouse pad when I need one. I needed a few cheap mouse pads and these are great. Does as I expected for a mouse pad. We needed several mouse pads for public areas and shared work spaces. I can use my mouse by simply moving it around the top of my desk as I desire and I works perfectly well.
