I have tried these Avery tabs in a variety of configurations now, and I've found they meet my needs really well. I really like these tabs a lot. The tabs itself is paper and holds the fine point Sharpie markings very well. Post-it Durable filing tabsPost-it Durable Filing Tabs, 2", Assorted Colors, 24/Pack MMM686F1, Post-it Durable TabsDurable tabs, 2w x 1 1/2h, blue, 50/pack, and Post-it Durable Index Tabs Post-it Durable Index Tabs, 1", Assorted Colors, 66/Dispenser MMM686LGBR.I hope others get their game up though, this is an area that needs improvement. They are simply ideal for inserting tabs into books, and all the handier because you can color code the tabs and also write on them. These tabs are so useful and easy to use. Most tabs are either really flimsey or the backing has a tendency to lose its adherence quality after a few removals and replacing on another page. Not this one.These tabs are very sturdy, have a really good adhesive backing, and you can write on them without the ink running. The tabs are so thick you can actually turn pages much like using a divider.This is almost overkill on behalf of Avery but a really welcome addition to a seemingly shrinking list of really good quality products. I'm using these tabs on my cookbooks. These tabs are durable, you can write on them...not sure what else to say. Roomy, re-positionable tabs are just the thing to mark your favorite recipes for quick reference in your cookbook collection. These wonderful tabs are very versatile, long lasting and reusable.Being able to add markers or dividers to technical books is a huge time saver.Not having to search through the contents or index to find the most commonly sought areas of information saves a lot of valuable time.I've found them useful to mark favorite recipes in cookbooks too.Endless uses for these handy tabs.Think text books, cookbooks, phone books and any other type of reference material you might access on a regular basis.A very useful tool that doesn't cost much. I like these tabs, they work great when you need to keep notes in books that you don't want written in. I asked Avery Customer Support how erasable the tabs were intended to be and got a response that did not understand that repositioning (what they advertise) is also likely to be accompanied by a need to change the annotations on the NoteTab. Lastly the tabs are reusable where you can peel them off of one page and move to another if you want to so that adds a bit of versatility. Usually, the biggest tabs I can find are about 1.5 inches wide, so the added width on these Avery tabs was very nice. I use these tabs to mark pages in books or other materials for easy and quick reference. The tabs remove easily and don't seem to damage the page. I prefer these tabs to regular sticky notes or using a book mark that might fall out. There isn't much else to say, except these tabs will do the job, and then some. Yes the tabs were easily applied, used a permanent marker on the colored tab .... successfully. Overall these tabs seem sturdy and well crafted. I really, really like these tabs. The tabs are easily repositioned, even several days later. The tabs feel very nice and sturdy. You can write on them (both the tabs and the adhesive part) with a regular pen or a magic marker - you don't need a sharpie - and a few seconds later - they are totally dry with no smudging - and I tried really hard to get the smudge going. These tabs were the perfect solution, especially because they can be written on and they remain in the location you placed them (unlike simple bookmarks).However, I noticed that the tabs become semi-permanent over time. While this doesn't affect me personally, as I won't be moving these tabs around, I thought it was important to mention in case it could affect someone else.Overall though, these notetabs are a great solution. These tabs I used for organizing my paperwork. The tabs were surprisingly easy to position -- probably because they are translucent and stiff, so they don't flop around, and I can see where they're going. The tabs may *also* be repositioned if necessary. These tabs replace the full sheet index tabs also sold by Avery. I try and place the tabs on the page in a descending vertical so that at least three topics are visible at one look. Supposedly, the tabs are easily moved if one decides to change reference pages, but I got it right the first time, so I can't comment on this feature. They are flexible, portable tabs, big enough to write a few notes on, transparent enough to fit over a text (so you can underline or box a word or two) and unlike Post-it Notes, a thin bendable plastic that separates sections of a book, notebook or binder. OK, so these are great tabs....how come these weren't made years ago. These tabs help me be more specific labeling necessary notes and documents so that they are easily found at a moments notice. I can move these tabs easily and without damaging my documents. These reusable tabs are wonderful. I've also cut the tabs into smaller pieces to use as markers and they work fine. Avery recommends to use these tabs for organizing textbooks, notebooks, binders, cookbooks and more. The tabs are see-through. The tabs themselves are a bit large and fitting an entire set within one binder might be difficult, but that's not really a huge complaint of mine. These tabs can be repositioned to your heart's content. See Caveat*)- Bright Yellow and Pastel Blue ColorsYou can color code your tabs using the yellow or pastel blue colors. Definitely recommended if you're planning on using these as permanent tabs. I LOVE these tabs and only wish I had had them when I was in college. These tabs really are repositionable. These tabs adhere beautifully to any notebook paper -- and just as easily can be removed and placed elsewhere! These little tabs will stay where you wnat, until and unless you want to place them elsewhere -- and they are obviously far less expensive than separators! I find these tabs helpful for research. These tabs come in a resealable bag, though I tossed the bag away anyway. The tabs can be written upon. These little tabs are awesome! Other than that, these are great tabs to work with. These tabs are wide enough to allow a several word tag to be written on them. These plastic tabs are sticky on one side (like a post-it note) and can be written on by any writing tool. I had tried the regular adhesive tabs once, but they were permanent, required that I mark the section on a small piece of paper and slide it in (hoping it would not fall out), and would often tear the page.Recently I started using theAvery Removable Label Pad, 1 x 3 Inches, Assorted Borders, 120 Labels (22014)as my current alternative. I was simply floored at just how great these tabs really are. However, if you need tabs for sectioning off notebooks, textbooks, binders, etc. I believe these tabs are perfect. The tabs also have a clear space on them that is see through that you can also write on. The tabs remove from the pages easily when you are done with them and do not leave any residue.T
