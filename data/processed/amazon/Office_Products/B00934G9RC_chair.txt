I've been surprised by how much I like this chair. It's an adorable chair and fits in virtually any room due to its compact size. This chair works as advertised and is relatively easy to set up. While this chair works well for writing, it doesn't work well at all for reading. well, might be hard for them to take you seriously.Second, if I absolutely loved this chair and used it all day, I just don't see the advantage of having the legs on the ball. This isnt a chair for "comfort" it has a purpose. I keep thinking of the red chair as the cap of a toadstool! I brought my chair to work and found it to be a fun alternative ... at first. I felt the chair did enhance my focus as my body was constantly making minor adjustments to maintain balance on the ball. The chair is stationary, but being able to easily move/rotate atop the ball seems to give the chair "wheels". !I surprisingly liked this chair a lot more than I expected to and it is PERFECT for my 8 year old daughter's room! Not only does the chair take up a smaller footprint, it's cool in a retro funky kind of way that she thinks is major cool!I think this item is a little highly priced but if you are looking for a funky option for sitting yourself or your kid you need to take a look at this great alternative to the standard backed chair!! I'm am completely blown away at how comfortable this chair is...even with no back support. This is a very fun chair. I was interested in trying the safco chair particularly to help one of my kids with focus and fidgeting issues.The box arrived with a big cut in it but luckily the parts were all fine. I found that if you're pretty tall, this chair is uncomfortable because it's so low. I don't hate this chair, but I just don't think I'll use it much either. This chair is same type of blow up ball that goes inside fabric cover that keep it attached to base. This is a funky chair--the first chair I've ever sit on with an actual blow up ball inside. The chair is fairly comfortable to sit in, and provides a nice alternative to sitting in a chair - which may be particularly useful for those who have an office job and do a lot of sitting. It does force me to sit quite upright, which I don't do with my usual chair, but without casters it's also in danger of scratching up the hardwood floor. I have the red chair, but if given the choice, I may have gone with a the black model. This chair is comfortable and stable. Since I've had the Zenergy chair, I've done some research into balance chairs and discovered some of the multiple benefits of using one on a regular basis. Use the chair for a few minutes each day and once you're accustomed to it, slowly build up to longer periods. The chair itself is sturdy and solid with powder-coated steel legs and a 17 1/2" anti-burst PVC ball on a polypropylene base. I gotthis chair, but it has wheels and seemed to roll away when I wanted it to stay put, but it never rolled properly if I wanted to move across the room while seated. This chair has no wheels and so doesn't have those problems. It keeps me from melting into my chair, something I tend to do at the end of the day. The chair is whimsical, fun & trendy, but not an investment piece. It's as steady as any other chair and I like the fact that it doesn't roll around. This chair was very easy to put together. When I first looked at the chair, I thought it was going to be too tall for my desk, but once you sit on it, I've found that it's a great height. This chair has some great and not so great aspects about it. The chair is much easier to use than sitting on a exercise ball as well.CONS:The cover can't be removed to wash. I wanted this chair because I am tired of my office chair. The good:- I personally think this chair looks cool.- You get the perks of sitting on an exercise ball (which is usually better for you IF you're sitting on it properly) with the added sturdiness that the legs give you and the added comfort that the fabric cover gives you.The neutral:- While the fabric cover is great, I'm concerned about how long the rest of this chair - mainly the legs and the inflatable ball - will last. I have to actually pick the chair up in order to place it in a "pushed in" position under my desk. I would recommend trying this chair. I was pleasantly surprised to receive this chair because it looks GREAT! I love the red chair and the look of the feet. The chair also seemed to keep its shape even after being bounced on--I had to try that.I highly recommend this chair. This chair is very stable and taller than most foot stools, and for that reason it is perfect to elevate my legs. it is slightly higher then my wing back chair and I can prop up my feet when reading or watching TV, yet it is not so high as to put any pressure on the rest of the body. Hard to balance the chair, hold the pump and take the plug out of the package. This crazy looking chair solves both those issues. I can't sit only on this chair to work for several hours (I usually switch it out with a normal desk chair after about 45 minutes or so) but for short term sitting it's extremely comfortable and feels like it helps me maintain proper posture. How could you not want a chair that looks as crazy as this.
