And, the paper has to be perfectly lined up in order to accomplish the binding. I barely even had to touch the paper...it was that easy! I worried about the paper going through my printer. When the paper is lined up it goes through very smoothly. The pre-punched paper went through my printer without any jams, and the spiral was easy enough to twist on. All the paper, baking and coversheets are cut so accurately, that twisting the spiral binding in at the end was quick and easy. I would have preferred a heavier weight paper for any purpose, as this paper feels as if it could rip  out easily, making the final product okay for a school presentation, but not as heavy as I would prefer for business or for many personal uses. I would also love it if there were a glossy paper available for doing picture calendars. I am definately going to get refill paper that has the holes prepunched for the spiral so that I can get the rest of my speeched together.I set the timer to see how long it would take me to assemble the sample 40 pages with the cover and backing with the spiral. I do see however you can buy more paper. So I put the special paper in the printer, ran off some high quality color copies, and then just twisted in the spiral binder that came with the kit. Especially when paper spines can be created and stapled economically. The paper isn't photo quality, but it's easy enough to trim and attach photo paper to the pre-punched pages. Maybe they'll offer other paper options at some point. It is possible to purchase additional paper. The paper is of a high quality and the finished product is quite professional. I did use up all the paper for this. Fellowes also sells the paper in a pack of 50 sheets for around $6.00. The paper is very thin, and you cannot print on both sides without it looking very bad being able to see through to the other page.These spiral presentation booklets are absolutely wonderful for any types of reports for school or business, cookbooks, personal stories and my favorite- family history. They make paper like this for printers and it is very white- where this cheap thin paper is not very white, producing less desirable pages for reading. A heavier, whiter paper would make this a perfect 5 STAR product. I'd like to see enough paper enclosed to allow four 40-page reports!

The paper quality is aceptable.

I prefer heavier paper (24 pound) but the 20 pound paper included is fine for most people.My son used it for a presentation he needed to put together for school and it worked great.

You need to use the prepared paper that comes with it and the price per project over the long run, is probably more expensive than a machine, and not as versatile.But for small projects done quickly and easily, the Twist and Bind pack is what I prefer to use between the two products I've mentioned in my review.
