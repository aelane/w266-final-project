The design on the front is cute and cheery. Just wish it was more pliable and less stiff.I love the design - very cute - but the rings aren't that easy to open for inserting materials.Meh. It has a very pretty, eye-catching design and I enjoy the smooth feel to the cover. The design is very pretty, but my binder arrived warped and the spine is so tight that it doesn't want to open flat, but maybe it will loosen up with use. The design is simply lovely and will add a touch of &#34;spring&#34; to the drab solid colors of our existing office binders. I am particular to the design - it is very spring with bursting flowers and bird. Overall, the design is much more extensive than expected.The metal rings are attached to the back cover and papers go in and out easily. Definitely recommended if you like the design. I love the design of this binder. I like this design a lot. Colorful and sophisticated with one design on the exterior and a complimentary design on the interior. If you love or even like the design and concept, start looking for Recycled Bliss Binders on sale at your local Big Box or Office Supply Place. The design is nice as well. The design is pretty and the construction is sturdy. The design is attractive, identical to the picture displayed in the listing, and the rings are mounted to the back of the binder as opposed to the spine. The design is cute without being too childish. The design is beautiful and rich.

I don't like this design as well at all.

We both though it was okay, but wouldn't have chosen it had we known the other design was a possibility.

I think I like this design because it's attractive and ageless.
