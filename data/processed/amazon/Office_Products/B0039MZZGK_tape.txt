This cute little tape dispenser is completely made of plastic. The entire tape dispenser only weighs a few ounces. This tape dispenser is cute to have it in a desk for decoration but that's all, is not durable, is lightweight and you will need both hands to pull tape. Now she never loses her tape dispenser! It works perfectly as a tape dispenser and is a real statement piece on your desk. These tape dispensers blend in with my computer work stations and I sometimes have a difficult time locating them. Speaking of tape, the dispenser will hold a variety of Scotch tapes that make life easier. Instead of the "normal" boring tape dispenser sitting on your desk, here you have the Red Ruby Slippers version. )This tape dispenser doesn't do anything special. overall very stylish tape dispenser. The tape that came with it also seems substandard compared to the typical Scotch tape I am used to. This is the cutest little tape dispenser  I have ever seen! What is the perfect tape dispenser? It would never run out of tape. It holds the tape firmly, and feels substantial. I highly recommend this tape dispensor to add a bit of whimsey to your desk top. This tape dispenser is so cute! You have to cut the tape at kind of a weird angle, too.But the biggest mistake? This is a tape dispenser that is cute and a conversation piece. It comes with a tape, which is good. It is easy to put the tape in the slot and it stays there unless you use it in an awkward position.It has rubberized footings (pun?) This Scotch tape dispenser is way cute too lightweight to use effectively. Best shoe-shaped tape dispenser I have ever owned. Like most have mentioned, this is not weighty enough to dispense tape with one hand. Basically, you're taping down the tape. My real tape dispenser has sand or some kind of weight inside of it to keep it more sturdy.Again its more a kiddie novelty thing so don't expect much from it. However as a tape dispenser well it is kind of lame.
