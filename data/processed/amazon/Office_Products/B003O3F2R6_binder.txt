First the easy to open binder Techlock rings are easy to open, are plastic and have not misaligned or broken. It is hard to get excited over a binder or notebook. The customizable binder measures 11.5 inches x 10.75, while the non-customizable one is 11.5 x 11 inches. Then where the binder usully has the spine, the hybrid has a sturdy fabric to save space and so that the hybrid binderbook can be folded and lay flat. I just can't fork over $15 a hybrid binder for every single one of my classes, but with the 200 sheet capacity, you could combine a few classes into one binder.One star off for the price because I just can't imagine most people being able to afford one binder, albeit an awesome hybrid one. Maybe they could offer a hybrid binder without the fancy dividers and paper to bring down the cost. This is a 1-inch binder with a maximum 200 sheet capacity, so there is a physical limit on how much you can add.Overall I was pleasantly surprised by its usefulness, the five pockets upfront give you flexibility in adding/removing things to it without opening it, and can partially make up (depending on how you use it) for the more cumbersome way of opening/closing the three D-rings. This is a nice binder for a college student. I am a binder fanatic. It's not a big and clunky as the typical binder. It's not quite as easy to open and close as a standard binder, so keep that in mind. Great Quality binder and easy to use. Simple binder that I can use to put all the papers and notes without loosing them. Because this isn't an ordinary binder, there isn't really a spine on this notebinder that you can easily grasp. As a binder, you can put in pages when you need to, remove pages without ripping them out, and there are dividers so you can categorize your paperwork. There's not resounding &#34;CLICK&#34; when you open and close the binder, and you can sneak papers in during lectures without bothering anyways. This is a binder you will not be using long term, most likely.The overall look and feel of the notebinder is that of a standard Five Star Notebook. I love this binder! Basically, this binder is a true hybrid, combining the best of a traditional three-ring binder with the flexibility of loose leaf paper and the convertibility of a spiral notebook.I eventually got several of these binders. The Flex Hybrid binder was primarily designed with students in mind, and as a former student I can say the Mead people designed a winner. If a traditional three-ring binder doesn't have enough flexibility for your needs, try the Five Star Hybrid Flex NoteBinder. I don't doubt you'll find it the most accommodating and adaptable binder you'll ever work with. It is a good binder if you want to take notes, I purchased it because i can take notes there when I am in a class with small tables as I can fold it, that is the hugest advantage. This is a lightweight binder, that lays flat for taking notes. It is odd to use, but ultimately very much like using a standard binder. Still, it is less clumsy to use than a binder given a small desk space.Something that is very appreciated with this soggy binder is that it includes everything needed for a class. A binder would be easier to open and close and have more durable rings. This binder has an aggressive unique design. It is a binder so you can add more  papers if you like. This is not a traditional binder. I think I was expecting a three ring binder with pockets. This binder feels like a notebook, but stores your paper like a binder. Although this binder is made of mostly plastic and lightweight, it doesn't seem cheap. Unfortunately even the Flex binder can't salvage papers pushed to the bottom of a backpack.The Five Star binder/folder may cost more than the average binder, but you do get some handy features:The plastic Techlock ring that replaces the soon misaligned metal ringsA cover that folds to lie flat and take up less room on a deskProtective storage for homework sheets or important school correspondenceIncluded are five tabbed dividers, 80 sheets of paper, college ruled and quad.This is an attractive binder that may motivate its user to at least attempt to be more organized. This binder is unique with it's flexible cover.
