The three included colors are quite visible, although I should point out that the lighting in the room may affect how some of them look.I also tried a variety of regular dry-erase markets (black, blue, red, pink) and they (as expected) are hard to read on the black surface. However, these new NEON colors can easily pick it up and they will lose their brightness as they get in contact with black/blue. The colors also do not show up as well on white boards. The colors are not very bright and don't show up very well at all. The bright colors make it more fun, and easy to see. The colors show up well on the black surface but they're not as bright as you'd imagine. The colors of the markers were not as bright as I would have hoped. The colors pop off of this black dry erase board and are bright and seen easily. I also use different colors for different things, like the yellow for nouns in a sentence and pink for verbs. :)  I already have one that works quite well, but I love neon colors and I always loved to write with gel pens on black paper so I decided to give this board a try!Now in terms of how bright the neon shows up...  Well, its not amazingly bright after the beginning of the first stroke, but that is generally normally for things of this nature, it is on black so it does get absorbed in to the blackness a bit, but this is also normal for gel pens as well, its just kind of the way it goes. The colors show up really well on the black, and they're also supposed to work on white boards as well.It comes with magnetic strips and sticky strips so you can mount the board to your wall or your fridge, and the mounts work really well. The colors "pop" on the black background, although they appear quite a bit lighter than I thought they would. The colors are vibrant on the black -- yellow and pink work better than the orange. I tried all of the colors and each is easy to read and contrasts the black dry-erase board well.I only have a few minor complaints. First, the colors of the pens are not particularly bright when the ink dries on the board, making it difficult to read at times. The colors show up well for me on the black dry erase board, but only the pink shows up well on my large white board.The ink flows nicely and it stays on well until wiped off with a cloth.My only complaint is there isn't a lip on it or anything to hold at least one marker. The colors are great and provide a great look on the board.The only con to this is it doesn't come with an eraser so either you would either need to use a paper towel or get bright neon colors on your hands. I expected the colors to be much more vivid and bright, similar to what's displayed in the images, but they weren't. Yes, you could tell they were three different colors, but just barely. The colors fade when they dry making things somewhat harder to read on a black background as compared to the white background, and there was no eraser like some products have, and no clip or adhesive strip on the marker so that it can be kept with the board, so I'm forever looking for the markers.Overall, not a bad product, but it could be better.
