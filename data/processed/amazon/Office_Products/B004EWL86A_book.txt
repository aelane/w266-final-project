With this book, parents will need to work with anyone who can't yet read the directions. There are book activities, but there are also suggestions for "team time" - opportunities for interaction and reinforcement of concepts.Skill Levels:1) For a child with a solid foundation in reading, most of the book activities can be done independently. This is not a book to just hand to children of this skill level and tell them to do it. I love that these book include subject matter from various subjects and it helps keep the kids interested. That being said, it is a great book to help children delve deeper into the world of math and problem solving, but they have to be interested. This book failed to grasp the interest of my children (other than the stickers). This book has 85 pages/work sheets. This book is more advanced than anticipated for my preschooler, but I look forward to using it later. Based on this book, I will likely purchase the Pre-K problem solving activity book. Overall I like this book and I think it is a beneficial math supplement. I got this book and the first grade version through Amazon Vine for my grandchildren. The book are very colorful and have a lot visual interest. This particular  book is based on working on kids problem solving skills. I got this book for my 5-year-old, who's currently in kindergarten. This book from Mead, however, really didn't capture her attention. So while this is an acceptable book, but don't recommend it as highly as some others I've seen. This book also has a much wider range of problem solving that seems to relate more closely to practical use.Second, each page has a set of problems and then at the bottom, an activity you can do with your child to reinforce the skill in their daily lives. The book also includes 40 "team time" multi-sensory cards and ideas for games to play with them. She would blow through this book in a couple hours if we had the time to sit with her for that long without interruption. This book is based on 6 logic skills:1. There is enough in this book to keep any child interested in doing extra school work. This book is a little advanced for him, but he still really loves working with me on the sheets. This book covers many subjects that Kindergartners need to work on, so I was impressed with this book. I don't use it as a main book for teaching, but its a great supplement for any phonics or language arts program. This book is truly for Kindergarteners, and it is challenging for them. It is not like the standard Scholastic book where you learn how to write letters, color pictures etc. It is finally a book that goes beyond the basics. Highly recommend the book.

I was excited to get this book for my almost five-year-old daughter.

But this book is packed with all sorts of thinking and learning activities:  fill in the letter, patterns, sequencing, cause-and-effect, basic logic problems, memory, syllogisms, categorizing, etc.

I received this book 3 days ago, showed it to my grandson after school that day, and since then that's all he wants to do.
