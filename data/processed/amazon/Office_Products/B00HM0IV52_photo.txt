That explains why I reserve the photo printer for photo-quality prints I have to have right now. A great photo printer This is my second large format pro-sumer photo printer. Your usual creative photo editing software is included and if you use Canon ink you have access to additional designs online.And that's it. The photo for this option shows a laptop wirelessly connected to the router.By the way, if you're not familiar with Canon's terminology, Access Point = Router.Once I had the iP8720 connected wirelessly, I was ready to print some photos...wow! My photo printed letter size. The 4x6 photo that printed was cropped so I lost some details in the clip.>>ThePrintHand Mobile Print Premiumapp (also purchased as the 'Free App of the Day')  did not have this driver so I couldn't print using this app.Photos, documents & disc labels can be printed with this printer.There are 3 buttons on the front of the printer: On/Off, Resume/Cancel & WiFi.To cancel a printing job, press the Resume/Cancel button, do not press the On/Off button.To use Quiet Mode  choose >Printing Preferences or Properties >Maintenance >Quiet SettingsI suggest you take some time to read the On-Screen Manual. This photo printer prints impressive photos for such a moderate price.I use it regularly to print off photos to send to relatives of my daughter, and thus far I am highty impressed with the quality/color of the pictures.The set up is easy and intuitive like most Canon products.My only suggestion is to not skimp on the replacement ink, although they are expensive you will see a significant decline in quality if you use cheaper versions (I had some from another printer), so print wisely.Pretty cool it can do such large photos too! The first photo I printed did have a faint line etched into the print. It seems you have to open the photo you want to print in the Canon photo app. Once the photo is opened, there is not much you can do with it except print it. Once it has printed that first photo, though, it is acceptably fast for a high quality photo printer.Paper: I use Canon Platinum or Photo Paper Plus Glossy II (samples included). The Photo Paper Plus is also an excellent photo paper.As far as features go, this printer is best suited to a single task: printing high quality photos. They're almost comparable to those from my Epson 837 photo printer.This printer really shines, though, as a large-size office printer. Because it's designed as a photo printer, the ink droplet size is small and text is nice and crisp.
