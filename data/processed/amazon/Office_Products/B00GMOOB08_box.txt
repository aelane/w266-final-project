The box itself assembles easily, too and there are no punch-outs that fall off and make a mess anywhere.All in all, this is a simple product so there isn't much to say except that it is very fit for the purpose intended. The first box I needed a knife to break the peroration and wasn't paying attention so I cut a side that wasn't supposed to be cut! I'm using another box to store various power cords and other cords (phone chargers, printer cables, etc.) Another box is being used to store cloth shopping bags. Yet another box is being used to store baseball cards that had been cluttering up a shelf in my basement and I have plans for the other boxes. The cross-flap makes the box much stronger and less likely to sag. I mean, $1.50 a box, what a steal!+++ THEY STACK UP WELL ON A DOLLY. Cutting the top off the box is a good idea but it leaves a ragged edge so that even a new box looks used. The completed box does have a double-bottom and side walls where the handles are. Each box has a lid. Shipped in a nice box which keeps whatever boxes you don't use right away nice and neat. Tie it tightly and toss one in each box to reduce the chance of mold or mildew. When I know I won't need to get into the box for a while, I tape the lids on to make stacking them more stable. The first box is the hardest to assemble as the instructions are not as helpful as they could be. I have often wondered what a 1917 box might have looked like, what they cost, and what they may have usually held.These revert to the Banker Box name, Fellowes is nowhere to be seen (except on the shipping box and the tiny copyright line), and they are branded with their relatively new product line, "Smooth Move".
