3M provides a template (3100-Q) at its website that can be used in MS Word. Downloading the template was quick and troublefree. These are easy to setup using the Avery 5167 template. Then in that template, simply type your address or whatever you want to print, then copy and paste it into however many labels you want to print, print, then peel & stick. You can use a template from MS Word or download the one from the 3M website. The template was lacking though. You can go to 3M.com/labels and find the exact template that you are looking to use. Getting the template loaded in Word 2007 took just a few seconds. I quickly gave up trying to find a template in Word 2007. They were very easy-to-use, stuck well, the Avery template worked perfectly, and they stuck to the envelopes as address labels well!I would definitely recommend these, especially if you are looking for a substitute for the Avery ones, without giving on the quality side: these are a nice thickness, without being too bulky, and are still easy to peel & adhere: loved them! You can download a template for MSWord from 3M's Web site (clear instructions are included). They are compatible with Avery's 5167 template or use one from [...].

Pretty much any template you may need is available on the 3M website.For me, this is an important feature, as it aids in quick, efficient alignment, rather than spending time determining proper alignment through trial and error.Aside from that, what else can you say about labels?

I found using the Avery template to be the easiest approach (just be sure that your label sheet loads straight into your print - if it's even a little crooked, you're labels will not print effectively).Peeling the labels off the "Quick Lift" sheet is a cinch, and they seem to adequately adhere to envelopes.

Downloading the necessary template was easy, fast, and straightforward.
