The Epson XP-600 is a wonderful printer. The printer has a touch screen, which conveniently folds into the body so that it stays out of your way. This invites me to use the printer sparingly -- which is a shame, because, why buy a nice printer only to try to avoid using it? While the printer itself is a steal, potential buyers should make sure to look at the price of replacement cartridges before they make the purchase. I feel very comfortable recommending this printer because the $99 retail price is the highest you'd pay for a comparable, no-frills all-in-one.This is actually the very first of all of the Epson's we own to seamlessly connect to our computer, tablet and cellphones without any hassles or calls to Epson. The printer properties has an Advanced tab with many options to help correct your photos. I also find this printer doesn't seem to use as much of the ink so quickly, compared to the Artisan 700 Epison Printer.Setting up the device with my wireless network was relatively easy using the step-by-step instructions. Here we have a printer that has the capability of being used as a printer, copier, scanner, plus two sided printing capability. As long as you consider that this printer is not made for use in a full-time office, you'll be fine. Recommended.11/5/13 Update:  After using this printer for a short time, I can't recommend it any longer. I was able to quickly set up the printer on my wireless network as it 'discovered' the network and I entered the network password into the printer. But this printer is intended for printing photos at home, with its additional photo-black cartridge and photo paper tray. The Epson Expression XP-600 is a great little printer that does not sacrafice quality for the small footprint. This printer is compact, yet, it does everything that the larger printers do. I didn't have a printer cable, so I used the screen, and even though it was probably slower, it worked effectively.The copy function is simple. I also have a Canon printer, and it was actually easier to set up than this one. The printer does what it promises to do, is fairly easy to setup, is very reasonably priced and compact. This is a very well built printer that is also compatible with other devices such as smartphones. This printer has a lot of features for its price tag. The printer also has a very easy to use LCD touch panel so you can easily select which cassette for paper and the sizes of photos or paper you want to print with. Like I said, this printer is different from my other printers, and certain features make it much easier to maintain.This is a smart little printer/scanner/copier. It's a nice, quality printer that has a lot of fun to use options. Slower than a printer designed for small office use (like its big brother the XP-800) but definately fine for home use.Scanning/copying is easily done through the touch controls, again allowing you to crop etc. I've been using this printer for a little over a month and I wanted to test it before giving it a review.I have to say that this tiny thing is a power horse! I am throughly impressed with it!Prior to this, I was using a large printer meant for offices for my small business but I found it lacking in quality and the amount of ink it went through was positively insane. This printer is "small" for a printer, but I wouldn't call it compact. It is very quiet compared to our old printer and timing wise it prints at a fair speed. My old printer seems archaic compared to this. It may not be as fast as a WorkForce printer but for some people, missing 3 seconds is not going to be a big deal.Also, I like the loading for the printer. The printer still does everything that one will want such as print, copy, scan and do double-sided printing, print color photos and gets the work done!The primary consideration for getting this printer is price and for those who print, but not too much. This is a great printer for students and parents that want a reliable printer! I recently bought this printer to replace my hunk of junk HP only to realize after setup this is as equally a piece of junk as my HP. So now I am running this same exact printer on my Macbook pro with OSX 10.8 and it is working fine. This printer prints clear and quickly. I was neededing a new printer so when I was able to get this I jumped all over it. But I do recommend this printer as it is very easy to use and the quality is very good. This is a perfect printer for personal use.The only thing that took some getting used to was the output paper tray being in the back, but to fit the sleeker look, the output try slides out from the front of the machine, you simply pull out when printing, and slide back when not in use. Having only used the printer for a  few days I can't yet comment on the longevity of the ink cartridges. I have been using a printer that was about 7 years old and didn't even know it was possible to print wirelessly until I got this printer. Setting up the printer with the wireless was so easy I was sure I missed something. The printer is quiet and works quickly. Just for that, I would say this is a good little printer for home use. I bought this printer because the reviews at the time I bought it were almost uniformly excellent. I returned the printer because of the damage. We needed a small printer to enable our preschool for wireless (AirPrint) printing. This printer is on the small side. Unpacking the printer was easy enough (yes, its a small footprint printer, very cool). Overall, highly recommend this printer for those looking to print photos or documents from the tablets and phones. I've never had a printer that took so much "prep" time to finally print out the document. This printer employs 5 ink cartridges, including a photo black. This Epson XP-600 "Small-in-One" printer is basically the same as Epson's higher endXP-800but without the automatic document feeder (ADF), fax capability, and with a clunkier control interface - though it says "2.5 inch touch screen" you select and control the printer via buttons surrounding the screen (the XP-800 has a true "touch screen"). "I give this printer 5 out of 5 stars because for what it purports to do, it does well. I'm not sure exactly what is going on, but I choose to believe that the printer is setting the ink cartridges up to be less likely to evaporate/dry out/leak, thus conserving ink over the longer term. This is a neat printer tho the included documentation is mediocre at best. This is an excellent printer. Since the printer seems a bit thirsty, the print costs will be more than for the Canon all-in-one this Epson replaced.My bottom line:  I really like the printer for its size, its features, its ease of setup, and the quality of its output. However, I personally would buy this printer again today if I had the decision to make again. Kiddo will be taking my old printer, and I'll be keeping this amazing new tool - as one who works frequently from my iPhone and iPad, I love being able to seamlessly print from these tools, to scan, to print two sided pages and to get great photo printing results. Solid and sturdy, this Epson printer is a much better fit in my home office than my old printer. The included DVD that came with the printer didn't have the drivers and software needed for setup so I had to download them from the Epson site, which was pretty straightforward and only took a few minutes, however I had to dig around and find an old USB cable because one is not included. I use black more than any, and being able to pull just one and replace is great.The printer takes up very little space and prints are clear and sharp. It was also pretty quiet for a printer. I like this printer because of its ease of set up and operation. Once selected, the printer and scanner were ready to use in 30 seconds. Using the printer's IP address in your web browser, you can configure some of the above settings (in an interface easier to use than the buttons on the printer itself) as well get firmware updates from Epson (there was one I performed when I received the unit. I unpacked the printer, and went through the step by step instructions as listed on the enclosed flyer. Personally, this printer is pretty much identical to the more expensive XP-800 (they have similar features and they use the same ink cartridges). I use my printer a lot -- every day at a minimum, but my home office is quite small, so my printer (an Epson Artisan) takes up more than its fair share of desk room. Now I can move the printer closer to the wall and get more of that important free desk space. The Epson Expression XP-600 Wireless Color Inkjet Printer, Copier, Scanner is an easy to use, easy to set up printer that can handle all you home office needs. This printer is feature rich, yet simple to set up and it has a low profile footprint that does not dominate the desktop. The bigger printer does have a fax, but that is not a feature I really need. What I like most about this printer was its ease of set of and how quickly it will synch to your tablet. This printer uses the standard 4-color process for printing (CYMK) and then an additional photo black, which if you are printing on photo paper enhances and deepens the blacks.Printing is quick and the colors come out bright. It's not often I get excited about a printer, but this is definitely an exception to the rule. Unless you want to walk over to the printer and raise the display up every time you print something, then this is not ideal for everyday document printing. I would highly recommend this printer. I use this printer for basic functions, including printing documents, scanning, and the occasional photocopying of text and images. This printer works well in all these capacities. Connecting this printer to my wireless network was very simple and only took a couple of minutes. While the printer as not fast as other Epson printers I own, document print quality is crisp, colors are vibrant and photocopying quality is excellent. I think the same will be true of this printer. This is a great printer. I would recommend this printer to the beginner photographer The Epson Expression XP-600 Wireless Small-in-One printer is an incredibly versatile machine with a small footprint. Easy to installThere isn't much that I don't like with this printer. I guess this printer and I just don't get along. I purchased this printer to take with me when I teach photography camps for kids. Otherwise, fantastic small printer for a great price. This is my third Epson printer and I'm just as pleased with this one as I have been with the other two. With a regular printer, you get 4 inks- black, cyan, magenta and yellow. Not only is the printer a great small size, it is super quiet when operating.The photos you get from this Epson XP 600 are not only fade resistant from the superior Claria Premium Inkjet Inks, but they claim your prints will last 200 years in album storage, so you know even your grandchildren will enjoy your photos. I was able to add this printer to my wireless network by only using the menu items in the printer's touch-screen control panel. I love this printer. No printer in this class will match a good photo printer in output, but with a little adjustment to taste the XP-600 can make a fine snapshot print.Duplex works as advertised. I am loving this printer. I love having such a customizable printer, personally. I was excited to try this printer out since I just had family pictures taken. I couldn't find the manual and had to unhook the printer and take it to the kitchen table to figure out how to release the stuck paper. This printer is an excellent addition to my office space and has saved us hours of driving time already in the few months we've had it.

I really do love this printer; I initially gave it 4 stars because it lacked a document feeder and has a nagging output tray habit.

The printer initialized on our network without problem.

The printer is AirPrint enabled, I see, but I haven't gotten there, yet.AMAZING PHOTO PRINTING:  The printer comes with a few pieces of 4x6 Epson Premium Photo Paper but I was so impressed with the photo printing quality that I went out and bought more.
