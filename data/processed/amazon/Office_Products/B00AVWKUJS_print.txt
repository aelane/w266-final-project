You must align the print head and there are instructions for the calibration. I almost exclusively print to this unit from my ipad from all over the house as well as outside. The print quality is really high for a printer of this caliber, especially when it comes to photo printing. You can comfortably print pictures up to 8.5 x 11 and get some really astonishing results. I compared the print quality of the same image from the MX922 and the MG8220 to the naked eye, it is basically impossible to tell any difference. If a print job required, say, 100 sheets I might have a concern; however, it is seldom that I need more than 10 sheets at a time so the problem of paper jamming or not processing because of cassette size is no problem for me. I still prefer to use a good old print shop for my photos, but if you need a quick photo print, you most likely won't be disappointed.There are two paper sources and the paper tray does not hold a huge amount of paper, 250 sheets does seem adequate for home office use. The print quality is outstanding, and it seems a solid well-built machine. The print quality is very good. So before I click print, I manually open the tray. So you have to wait for each print job (not each page) to finish before you get the next preview window. The print quality, both documents and photos, is superior.
