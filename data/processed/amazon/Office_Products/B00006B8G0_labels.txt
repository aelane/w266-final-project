We use labels of various sizes constantly rather than getting envelopes and folders pre-printed as a cost saving measure and a way to offer easy customization of our brand to our clients.As others have stated here, a label is a label is a label...right? These labels work just like conventional laser labels--just use Avery's template to print the labels you need. What makes these labels different is their construction. This makes the labels truly opaque, so that they block any previous writing or labels that they are applied over. These are great, functional labels at a very reasonable price. These labels are exactly what they say they are- truly blocking. Finally, we have labels that allow for reuse of pocket portfolios without compromising the identity of its previous owner. These labels look good, save us money and time. Avery labels have been considered the best when you need or want labels that you can print from your computer. I was surprised and very pleased to see these labels with TrueBlock Technology! This happens most frequently with labels. This is vitally important as with these big labels pressing them onto envelopes sometimes requires quite a bit of handling. I'm very happy with these labels and will definitely be switching from the regular 2X4 labels to these with TrueBlock that work seamlessly and smudge-free.Highly recommended! These labels are so nice. These are great labels. For me this has made making great labels more user friendly because I always found the templates in word to be a bit clunky and limiting. I have used Avery labels for years for my small buisness. I have used the labels for shipping and for labeling books or other items. These labels are nice, thick labels with an opaque backing to completely cover/obscure whatever is under them. They're crisp looking labels, and they do a good job of blocking out the previous label for a cleaner look if you have to relabel something. I use labels a lot...for postage and for labeling items around the house and in the garage. The labels are easy to use, old text covered up is as advertised, and there are plenty of templates to print these out.Easy to use, nice price, great product. What can you say these are mailing labels for large envelopes or packages. These labels are easy to print on and block out any information underneath them so you can ship without worrying. I've been using labels of this size under the brand of a national office box store, and in one notable way, the Avery product is superior. These labels have a dark underside ("TrueBlock") which successfully masks what's underneath, making them perfect for covering a previous label on a box. But only these Avery labels are completely opaque.For users of Microsoft Word, you can use the Label Wizard to set up printing, or you can go to the company's web site to download the label templates.The only thing that I didn't like about these labels is their flimsy backing sheet, which doesn't affect the labels themselves but which makes it more difficult to line up the sheets in my printer. I really like these labels. They are just thick enough to cover up writing or old labels when recycling envelopes. These thick labels (they call it "TrueBlock Technology") will go right on top of the old labels and cover them up completely. The labels are easy to peel and attach snugly to your envelope or package. You can place these labels over old labels and the new ones will cover the old printing completely. Plus, they integrate automatically with the labels tool that comes with Microsoft Word (Tools > Letters and Mailings > Envelopes and Labels). And that's welcome!These labels also cover any printing underneath should one want to send something out in a used enveloped. I use labels on reused glass tincture bottles for my clients, and since not all of the originals have easily removed labels, it has been frustrating trying to use labels that show through or don't sufficiently cover the original. These Avery labels are specially designed to coverup anything underneath them. If you don't need this then these labels would be an unnecessary expense in comparison to ordinary mailing labels.These labels are designed for laser printers, though you could also use them in an inkjet. These labels are something that I'll have available whenever I need to re-use a package/shipping envelope that has dark writing on it. To compromise, we decided to try these labels and much to my surprise, I can't see the old label under this one. Most labels these days are just good labels. However, if you are looking for labels that will be printed in a laser printer, I'll recommend Avery's products, as I've had great results with them. The labels separate nicely from their backing, and they stick nicely.These labels are designed by Avery with what they call, "TrueBlock(TM) Technology" - and I have to agree, if you stick these over the top of an existing label, these will cover them well, and you won't see the label underneath it showing through. Great labels. I received these labels from the Amazon Vine Program, and was eager to give them a try. These labels looked as if they would be perfect for my Christmas packages and I was correct. The labels are sturdy, took printer ink well, and are opaque so that nothing can be seen through them. Most Avery labels can stick to a wide variety of materials ranging from paper to pained surfaces to plastic and these are no exception.As advertised, they are very opaque and anything underneath will generally not show through. These labels are shown on the outer package with a return address and the addressee fitting comfortably on the outside of an envelope. Instead of looking liking tiny labels on a big envelope, these labels were sizable enough to dominate the envelope well enough to stand out and be noticed - particularly important for mailing purposes.It's always good to find other uses for labels - these were just large enough to fit another purpose very well. The labels are thick and solid enough to work without looking flimsy. I am very happy with these labels. Avery labels always do a good job for me, and particularly print well with MS Word, I had no problems printing labels properly aligned and the print quality was excellent, very clear without any smudges. These labels are a prime example of what I'm talking about. These labels go on clean right over the top of the old ones with no see-through to confuse the delivery person. One of these Avery TrueBlock labels covers all the writing underneath and looks very clean and neat. These Avery TrueBlock labels are exactly that. The labels did not get stuck in the printer.As the sheet includes just labels (no margins), they peeled off easily and could be subsequently appliedquickly and neatly to the packages. The labels print perfectly and have a decent level of stickiness. They cover up the labels underneath completely so you can recycle envelopes that people have sent you; they stick easy and print on easily without smudging; excellent all around!! These labels worked beautifully in my HP2600n laser-printer. The labels are of good quality and it peels off nicely and ready to go on the re-usable envelop. These are good, standard solid labels from Avery - template suggestions are always on the package (so helpful) and I've used both the 3M version, Avery version, and branded store versions (like Office Depot) - they all work well as address labels - if you are wondering how to choose, I'd make your decision based on price, and features such as the TrueBlock Technology included on these (which makes using a a recycled box or envelope much easier - it's thicker and truly covers up the older used labels below! Can be used to cover old labels - no see or bleed through on these. I requested these labels after trying out a set of ink jet labels that were too small to be useful. These labels are larger and easier to use. What is particularly nice about these labels is they are fully blocking of any printing underneath. Furthermore, one can print only the labels one needs and reuse the label page provided one prints and removes from the bottom up. These labels are easy to remove from the backing and attach firmly to the envelope or box.To use these in an ink jet printer, select plain paper but request high resolution printing (700 dpi or higher). These labels are a good size for mailing first-class parcels and larger envelops. These labels are of good quality and just what they should be. I hate cheap labels that require you to tape the edges down so they don't peel off. These labels are great for covering old information.I frequently ship reused boxes and I don't have to double up my labels anymore or cross out with black marker before affixing a new shipping label.In addition they print easily using them template and the adhesive is just fine which is what I've come to from Avery.
