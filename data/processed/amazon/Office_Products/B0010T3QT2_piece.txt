It brings some piece of mind for when you are mailing checks or other documents with personal information! I took a piece of paper and wrote on it with a Sharpie, put it in the envelope, held it up to the light, and there, clear as a bell, was the word "Hi" that I had written on the paper. But it certainly does make it harder if you include an extra piece of paper. It did give me a little piece of mind while sending out my mailings.What did entice me to get these is the fact they are self-sealing. Then when I do not have to lick or moisten some unknown piece of paper that (pardon the pun) seals the deal. Since they are one piece construciton there is no added waste from the strip of paper usually left behind on my other self-sealing envelopes. Similarly, the same piece of paper with bold printing on it was a little less visible in these envelopes, than in the Target envelopes (but not invisible), holding both samples up to a desk lamp.Trying to unseal the sealed envelope causes the flap to visibly shred, also improving security.Recommended. I put in a piece of paper with heavy ink writing on it and could not see it up against a light. Then again, that piece of paper was probably a little heavier stock than a check would be. Nice - one less piece of garbage for me to have to throw away. These actually have a piece that folds up to reveal the glue, so there is nothing to throw away.
