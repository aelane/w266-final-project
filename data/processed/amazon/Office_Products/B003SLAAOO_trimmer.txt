I compared this trimmer with the heavy duty one from work and the latter one does not seem much stronger than this one - except for the handle, which is a little fragile on this model. This is a great trimmer for various school projects, or for cutting photos, coupons, etc. I have another Fiskars trimmer, but the kind with the rotary on a track, this is my first guillotine style trimmer.I was impressed with how lightweight and yet sturdy this trimmer felt upon opening the box. This particular trimmer is for smaller jobs and is therefore nice to have at home. Overall, I'll say that this is a great, inexpensive trimmer that is super-useful to have at home. This is a great trimmer. But, it's an excellent, small-ish sized trimmer for scrapbooking, trimming photos, or general paper cutting. Outside of that, the Fiskars trimmer works well, and cuts paper cleanly. I love my new trimmer. The Fiskars trimmer is perfect for small projects. I love how easily this trimmer cuts through paper up to 12" and is easy to store. I am extremely pleased with this trimmer and recommend it for light to medium work load. Remember... this is a light-duty trimmer...not made for heavy density trimming... take that job to the larger trimmers available. All in all... an excellent trimmer for the money!PROS:Inexpensive.Lightweight.Does the job.CONS:No paper guide.HELPFUL HINT:You can line up the pages on the hash marks without needing a guide.
