Unfortunately, I had wide markers and I couldn't fit much on the squares. I was excited to try these markers out instead. The fine markers write so much better. BUT, I wish the markers were darker. They are light even though they are supposed to be bright.Are they better than the alternative--wide markers? They are the opposite of chisel-tip markers on a conference room dry-erase board where someone on the other side of the room can read.Hack + Tip: you can use some universal tablet stands to prop up your dry erase board easel-style. These markers are great. Instead, these markers are perfect for things like small dry erase boards on fridges/in lockers, or on dry-erase calendars (that's what I use mine for). We got this markers to use in our homeschool, I do a lot of work on the whiteboard with my eight year old. These colorful markers are great for keeping a busy schedule straight. Expo markers, as far as I am able to tell, are truly the gold standard among dry erase markers. Excellent markers and a fine and handy set. I use whiteboard markers daily with my tutoring students and Expo markers have been my go-to product because they are reliable, the colors are bright, and the odor is low. These markers are nice because they have a fine tip on them. These markers can get into small spaces as no other dry-erase has been able to.Very pleased with them. These markers are great to use when you have fine lines that you need to do. These are the only markers to buy. This happens on all the markers, regardless of the thinness of the tip. Expo Brand markers may be a little more money to begin with, but well worth it in the end. These very fine-tipped markers are great for a small wall calendar - not a classroom whiteboard. These markers leave a line that is comparable in size to that of an ultra-fine Sharpie. The regular fine-point markers I'd been using for years were still thicker than I wanted. I have found the Expo markers to be a nice compromise between ease of erasability while still maintaining consistent ink flow and lasting a decent amount of time. I have used some markers that are more vibrant and skip less (not that it's really an issue with the Expos till they start to run low), but they are a real pain to erase, necessitating a damp rag then another wipe with a dry rag to get the whiteboard clean. And the cheaper markers don't write as well or last as long. These markers are great! These markers are VERY fine, so my writing is clear and easy to read, and isn't smushy or huge like writing can be with larger-pointed markers. The markers are so pointy that they can leave impressions on the thinner sheet protector plastic, so now I'm using report covers from a local dollar store, which works better anyway.
