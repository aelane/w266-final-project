These are the right size for return address on letters. These are true to size, peel and stick easily, and are a decent value.They are slightly narrower than the return address labels that I typically use, so they require a small font, but they are still good and the font is not so small as to render them illegible. When you buy it, the size is clearly listed. The size is good for folders, return address, inventory, shelves, and similar uses, but too small for use as a shipping label.These labels are a good value, top quality for a reasonable price. The size of the label seemed closer to the size of a 5 tab divider label - which is pretty small so if you have a long address or want to include a design or something with more than 3 lines, you'd have to fiddle a bit with the sizing in the template. Despite the small size, I was able to get satisfactory results with a small print because the paper absorbed the toner nicely and got nice crisp lettering. Their size is about 1/2" by 1 3/4". Their size,  inch by 1 and  inches, makes them appropriate for small return mailing labels, small object labels, and so on.I will say outright that I did not try them in my printer. They're a standard size. They are a perfect size for return addresses especially on letter-sized envelopes and I am very pleased with them. The size is a convenient one in that I can utilize them for a variety of uses.It's nice when a product is good and does what it is supposed to and is designed in a way that sweats the details. They are of standard size to work with any standard label template or software, which you can also download from 3M. Their smallish size has enabled me to multipurpose them for the holiday season. It's also a good size for labeling other things - but they are Permanent, so don't put them on things you don't want to t stay on. This size of the labels is also great. These are a perfect size and easy to use. 3M Return Address Labels are easy to use, truly adhesive, the right size, and priced competitively. Their 1/2"x 1 3/4" size is right for even smaller envelopes.And perhaps most importantly (at least in my case), they are easy to print using the free templates at the 3M site.Highly recommended. They are the perfect size for printing your own return address labels. They are small-just the right size for a return address label.
