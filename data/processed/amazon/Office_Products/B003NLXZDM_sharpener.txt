This sharpener does stay in place once installed - in fact it is near impossible to dislodge once suctioned into position. An electric sharpener seems like a waste, so I was interested when I saw this Stanley manual sharpener.The vacuum base on the sharpener does let you move the sharpener easily, but I found the sharpener loses its grip, so I need to make sure the sharpener is stable each time I use it. I needed to use the sharpener a few times to find the right speed and pressure or me pencils would only be sharpened on one side.The key characteristic of this is if you want a sharpener you can move. If you don't need to move it around, a sharpener that you can permanently and firmly attach to a wall is probably a better option. Personally, the sharpener works well but the suction only lasts a few minutes at the most, and this is on a smooth glass table. The sharpener has sealed itself to a wooden desk, dining room table, and dresser - all of which have smooth finishes. The sharpener I received vacuums extremely well to the few surfaces I tried and didn't budge no matter how much pressure I put on it. No other sharpener has ever done that. This sharpener does the job very well, and I like all of the different sizes. The sharpener itself seems fine. But after the sharpener gets used a bit, it dislodged. I tried setting the sharpener up on a wooden desk, a formica countertop, a slab of granite, and a piece of plywood.
