The green laser is very bright, so I barely have to turn down the lights in a room (eyes are more sensitive to green - hence the use of green in night vision goggles).4. Also, the laser does have the longer range advertised.The carrying case is a nice, semi-hard shell case. When it comes to the basic laser technology, it's almost impossible to go wrong. Green laser pointers are much brighter than the equivalent red ones, and the green color seems more appealing. The laser is great and works as far away as I can see. He suggested I try a green laser as the one used by the biochemist was quite visible for him. The laser button has a very dangerous defect of frequently and unpredictably locking ON, risking the vision of members of the audience if you are not careful. The red laser units would last a whole semester before a battery replacement was needed because it powered down when you put it away. This green laser went through a pair of batteries in just four weeks. Clearly the green laser probably draws more on the battery, but I'm guessing I failed to switch off the unit when I put it in the case on one or more occasions. However this green laser is not the brightest green laser that I have seen. Occasionally I shot a green laser flash onto the wall behind the computer, and it had a similar effect. Once the laser light is ready, it is splendid. Your Keynote, PowerPoint, and laser pointer presentations will be much better when you use this handy remote.
