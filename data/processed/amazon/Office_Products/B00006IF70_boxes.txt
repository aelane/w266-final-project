My boxes need to be securely attached with no chance of tape coming loose. However if you are just sealing boxes then maybe stick to regular packing tape and save some money. This would be great for securely closing moving boxes or for shipping heavy boxes. As far as using to ship boxes this stuff is great. I have taped up boxes, envelopes, and styrofoam--even applied this to walls, and so far I have no complaints.I have to recommend this tape ABOVE any other plastic shipping tape. For re-enforcing boxes it doesn't get much stronger than filament based tape. I've been able to use it for wrapping large boxes at least 20 inches or more in diameter. It is perfect for boxes or anything else that needs &#34;taping&#34; ... highly recommended! I used it to secure the boxes that had the Christmas presents in it - there was NO way they'd be able to sneak into those boxes!An excellent tape for when you ship heavy items or need to make sure the box won't pop open in shipping. If you are working with only new boxes, no complaints to be had! If you ship many boxes every day, this might be a worthwhile purchase. Ain't gonna break open my boxes any more. If you want to reinforce packing boxes, or are in need of a moisture and puncture resistant, nearly unrippable tape stronger than duct tape, this could be a good option. I ended up with around 50 very, very heavy boxes filled with books. If you are packing very heavy boxes, this should hold their bottoms together. Those boxes were heavy!
