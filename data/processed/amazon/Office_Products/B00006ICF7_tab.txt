I have tried several other tab products that use templates for tab print outs and this is easier although I found it ti be a bit misaligned.In addition to the tabbed sheets you get some handy pockets or page protectors. DH wanted some tab dividers to organize his business papers. These are "eight tab" dividers and five sets are nicely packaged in a sturdy package. You place the tab index at the back of the document. It's not just the tab that is colorful, it's the entire divider. I have yet to decide my tab titles and pick the designs, but am way pleased with everything about these sets.WILSON JONES:Wilson Jones View-Tab Transparent DividersWilson Jones WorkStyle Erasable-Tab Index DividersWilson Jones Cut and Sewn Binder, Round RingsWilson Jones WorkStyle Cut and Sewn Round Ring BinderWilson Jones Minute Book, Bound, Locking SpineWilson Jones Ring Ledger Sheets, 5 x 8.5 InchesWilson Jones 362 Basic Round Ring View BinderWilson Jones ColumnWrite Columnar PadWilson Jones 812 Telephone Address Book, Round RingWilson Jones Ring Ledger Binder, 1 Inch Capacity, 5.5 x 8.5 Inch Size, Blue I hate having to write on each tab, I hate having them rip by mistake, I hate putting labels on them to make them look better but not having the labels line up perfectly...I can go on and on why paper tabs are inferior to these. And the tab writing issue has been completely thrown out - you just print all your headers on one sheet and put it on the back of the binder - the tabs are see through so you can see your subjects through the tabs on the header sheet. I love how you print the tab names on a page, and you can see through the tabs to find the correct divider. If you don't mind the pre-ordered tab colors, I think you'll like these tabs. Now you don't have to write on each tab, cut and insert them one by one. The tab is just an extension of the sheet itself. Hence the tab dividers for binders.I cannot live without dividers in my binders and over the years I&#8217;ve probably tried almost every type of divider known to man.
