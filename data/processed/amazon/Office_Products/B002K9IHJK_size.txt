The size is large enough for two or three lines of printing.There are 100 labels per package, which will last me quite some time. They stick nicely, you can easily trim them down to fit whatever size you want and they peel off nicely as well. The size is large enough to provide for large numbers and then permit additional identification in smaller print. These are a decent size and best of all removable. The nice size and bright colors are easy to see on your boxes (or whatever) too. They are a perfect size for most of my labeling needs, and the bright colors make them easy to spot on boxes.I even used the green ones for gift tags on Christmas presents/gift bags -- especially nice, since they don't ruin the gift bag, so it can be re-used! The size is perfect-not too big, not too small.The green and hot pink  colors are bright and can be readily seen-even from across the room!Most people like to be better organized and these sticky removable label pads clearly assist in that goal.It is easy to label and catalog your papers and other items.These are readily affordable and easily available. They would take a standard size weight and determine how And thiswell the adhesive worked by determining how long a specific sized adhesive patch would support the weight - and they would also determine how it would release - would the release be sudden, or would it be gradual? They're a good size and the colors are nice and bright making them easy to see. The size is nice for simple one/two word labels (not a lot of room for anything extra). The size of the labels make them perfect to put on boxes or cabinets, and the bright colors really stand out.

The size is quite narrow, though more than enough to label boxes or shelves.The paper on the "Color Coding labels" and "Label Pads" are similar except that these only come in two colors while the "Color Coding Labels" come in four.

Actual size is 3 3/8" (3" without the non-stick strip removed) by 2" not 2 7/8" by 1 7/8".
