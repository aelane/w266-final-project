Hence, the only place in my kitchen that looked like a feasible surface was the fridge. There's a place to put a pen. It's great that it also has a place for a pen. There is also a place for a pen too.Great, innovative product ! Then when you reach for one Post-It, another pops out to take its place. It has a place to hold a pen which is very helpful for those of us who consistently misplace a pen. I particularly like that they have a place to keep a pen or pencil. There's also a place on the side for a pen/pencil. In a public place, you may go too quickly through them.As a fan of the post-it, I'm so glad I finally got a pop-up holder and this wall version is more compact and convenient. There is a place for a pen or pencil too so it would work well by a phone or on a refrigerator for messages. This has a place for a pen or pencil, but I'm not one to keep writing utensils in one place, and this hasn't changed my habits.What I don't like about the holder is that it requires special Post-Its that feed from every other end. There is also a place for a pen. Its not all over the place and easy to access. I use them all over the place, especially in my work life. It actually "snaps" into place and gives a firm hold without any wiggle. I like that it has a place for a pen. I like it that it has a place to stick a pen or pencil, since they tend to be absent when needed.
