Very good ink quality too. The ink itself is good quality, well-suited to producing clear, sharp photographs and documents. I agree that ink is expensive, but the price you pay for these machines nowhere covers the cost, unless you paid full retail. The original ink cartridges lasted quite a while (since November, and 2 of them haven't run out yet). This is pretty good ink. I need the ink for my printer but I hate paying so much. It's ink! I am going to try some generic ink to compare. I bought generic ink cartridges for my first Canon printer. This ink always prints beautifully and I have never had any problems with the cartridges in any color! Wish the ink lasted a little longer but I never change it right away when it warns me I need to replace a cartridge as there is always ink in there for about 10 or 15 more pages. I will buy this ink again on here when I need to. I like shopping on Amazon for my ink cartridges. Only the gray ink tank had to be replaced so far. This ink is a must for anyone who owns the MG8220. The ink produces vivid and colorful pictures that are frame-worthy and on the right paper can stand up to wear and tear for a long time. I recommend this ink for anyone who's printer is still under warranty. Purchased this ink for my newCanon Pixma MX882 Wireless Office All-in-One Inkjet Printer (4894B002)printer. I've been using HP ink for the last decade and finally gave Canon a try since I shoot film / video with Canon cameras for my business.

I have always stuck with OEM ink, because the results and reliability are worth the extra cost to me (plus printer manufacturers are making it increasingly difficult to use non-OEM solutions).However, it is beyond dumb to see the combos that Canon is offering for the new line of ink jet cartridges.
