So I wish that instead of the yellow marker, I wish they'd included a different color that's known to show up. If only the actual marker part worked better and appeared more vibrant. This marker set has fun, bright colors (although the yellow one is of limited use on a white board). The marker makes a line more similar to a pen you might use, so this would be great for a personal lap dry erase board or again - practicing school work on a dry erase board.The markers are small - probably 3/4 the length of the more common dry erase markers.But, the cheapness of the magnets and the erasers not being properly attached would keep me from purchasing or recommending these markers. The black marker seems fine though. Each marker in this set measures about 5 inches long with the cap on and they are about the same diameter as a crayon - perhaps just slightly bigger around so these would be great for elementary children or if you are like me and love color coding things.I have a large dry erase board on the wall in my kitchen and I love that these markers stick right to the board because there are magnets in the caps so they are always easily accessible. It's so much easier than always looking for a marker. I like how it is smaller than your average marker - it feels more like a pen and can be transported (read: tucked behind an ear) easily. How about this:  The black marker writes dark enough that it can be read from across the room. As I noted above, the only marker that can be read from a distance is the black.The magnets are so weak that they are close to being useless. I know, how can a marker be easy to use - well they are small, have the perfect point, don't skip, have a magnet and eraser all built in. It was very easy to wipe off the marker (from the board book). We also like that each marker comes with its own eraser.
