The print speed is plenty fast for us and we seem to get good mileage out of the cartridges, although we do mainly print black and white documents. If you want fast print speed in an all in one, this thing is the top of the heap. Additionally, in the print driver, you cannot select any photo printing options if you're printing from tray 2 - this is a real bummer for me.What I like:-I really like the wireless scanning. The print quality is extremely good! But I really missed the 2-sided print capability and the ability to easily print envelopes easily. I've found print quality to be good. Second, I wanted the print speeds that this printer advertises.I do not know how they arrive at their speed specs, but here are my test results:Although black text printing is lightning fast, color printing on high quality settings is not much faster than my 5 yr old epson Stylus. Photo print speeds are equally impressive. Test print quality for text was superb, Photo quality was good enough give that its just 4 ink printer (vs. a dedicated 8-9 ink photoprinter), scan quaility for documents was spot on. The print quality of copies is, of course, dependent on the quality of the original. I hit print, and it works. The print quality is superb, too. However, the print quality is definitely less than stellar. I have tried aligning the print heads along with various other "tricks." I just hit print and the front side prints out fully then the paper is almost instantly sucked back in and the printer does the other side at equal speed. The print outs are fine, text is clear and looks quite nice.
