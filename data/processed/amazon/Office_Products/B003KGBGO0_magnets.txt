I may grow tired of these fun magnets but for now, I find great joy in using them and I think most people will too. These are really cute little magnets that you can write on like a white board. The magnets keep it in place. The magnets on the back work well. Being magnets, they can serve a dual purpose of holding grandchildren's photos or drawings.Both magnet writing boards are about the size of my Kindle Fire HD. The two 5x8-inch magnets were in excellent condition and had pleasant colors. These magnets are a great size for fridge mounting for notes and lists. The magnets work ok, occassionally they slip on the fridge, but that might be my fridge more then the magnets.Pros:writes smootlyerases clean and easynice markers, but can replace with standard dry erase when needed.Two colors which is nice, can use one for home, one for work notes to orgainze thoughtsCons:Finding a marker color that shows on the purple one a little more of a challange. )The magnets on the boards are OK, though sometimes I find the boards at the bottom of the refrigerator door. These ReWritables magnets are actually really nice. The magnets are strong enough so that they stay up without a problem, and they're great for reminding me what I've run out of while cooking. The magnets are sturdy and stick well to the fridge but we&#8217;re using different markers especially since the purple board is not very light color &#8211; definitely need a black marker for this one. So the the two magnets here are compact, pretty and have a pretty good magnet on the back. The magnets holding up the writing surfaces are solid and are a function size that doesn't crowd a typical fridge.
