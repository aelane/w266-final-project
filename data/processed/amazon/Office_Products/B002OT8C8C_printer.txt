Unplugged the printer and started the computer again and it worked fine. Tried plugging the printer into another outlet but on the same circuit and everything worked but got a very bad hum in the computer speakers both in that room and the next. I am using the printer in a home office with 30 year old residential wiring. I finally had to delete the printer and let Windows autodetect and reinstall it for it to perform properly. You might also care that this printer is a bit noisy when it's not in sleep mode. 600 x 600 on this LED printer is not the same crispness as 600 x 600 on a laser.I found that photographic images require printing with the Vivid color option, and with brightness increased. This is definitely a great printer for the small office. If you need duplex, do not buy this printer since you will manually have to print the backside of your pages. The printer allows you to install up to a single 512MB module. Once unpacked, the printer itself is a bit smaller than the box would lead you to believe, but still, it's a good-sized printer and quite heavy at around 50 pounds. As an All-In-One printer, it features, printing, copying, scanning, and faxing in a fairly compact package. When I received the printer I was astounded at the size of the box thinking to myself this is one big printer. The manual that comes with the printer is very clear so the setup was straightforward. I set the printer to the thickest paper setting, inserted the paper and sent the image to Big Brother. I would give this printer two thumbs up.Addendum:  the above based on initial review.
