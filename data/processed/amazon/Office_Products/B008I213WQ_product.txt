Another great Avery product. I used this product to make raffle tickets for CHristmas Day and they were a big hit. This product is great. She was extremely happy with the final product. It IS a nice product, though. Highly recommend this 5-star product. All I had to do was enter the product number at the Avery print website. Very practical and user-friendly , Avery has added yet another great product to their office supply line. What makes this product great is not the basic idea of having tickets with stubs. Avery usually makes a good, basic product for those short jobs that don't need to go to a professional. This is a cute product with many potential uses for small businesses, school classes, or community groups. Just go to avery.com and type in the product number (16154). I think this is a pretty decent product for what it is. Overall it is a cool and fun product that can be used a s little or as much as you want based on your word savvy skills. Like most Avery product this is a great way to create professional looking tickets at home.Ink from my inkjet and laser printer adheres well. Another great Avery product :) I have used allot of Avery products and these are as good as the rest of their products. If you pay for this product, you should be able to download what it takes to make it work without giving them information. I understand that this is a fairly new product for Avery, but it would be nice if they had more options for Windows users and better directions on creating your own design.The tickets themselves are easy to tear apart, and I liked that the stub end had a more robust connection so that when pulling tickets apart the stubs wouldn't accidentally come apart as well. First, the product number can't be found in the templates - I tried both the product number - 76154 and the alternate number, 16154. Overall, it's a creative product that works well. )All in all, this is a decent product, that fills a certain niche, that will definitely me a lot more useful when/if Avery provides a downloadable template that makes it more cross-platform compatible. Not much to say about this product. However, since this is a relatively new product, templates are not available in standard software such as Word. I was glad to find this product--to be able to create numbered sequential tickets for fund-raising raffles or similar needs. This product on the other hand is simply a set of perforated sheets with ticket sized areas. Just use the product number at the website mentioned in the description to get there. I used these for a product party. So, I was interested to see how this product, "Avery Tickets with Tear-Away Stubs, 1.75 inches x 5.5 inches", might fare.What you get ... 20 sheets, each cut up into 10 two-part tickets.

When a product like Avery raffle tickets comes along, I hope it helps ease some of the burden of the tasks before me.

Avery has designed this product for those looking to design and print their own tickets, where you have a ticket and a stub with matching numbers.

Overall, this is a nice product, one that allows you to create your own attractive raffle tickets or gift certificates.
