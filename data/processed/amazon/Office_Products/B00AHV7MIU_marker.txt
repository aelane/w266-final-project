You need to use a permanent marker--a Sharpie works great. Apparently you have to use a permanent marker and white eraser as shown on the package. That's an oxy-moron if I ever heard one; PERMANENT marker needed to be erasable. For those who don't have the marker & eraser, buy them when you purchase these folders. I used my Sharpie permanent marker to write on the tab and it writes smoothly. Although you can erase permanent marker from the laminated tab, it is way too much work, especially if you want to erase many tabs at once. Get yourself a very fine Sharpie marker:  You won't be happy with the results if you try to get by with the "regular" size. With these you can write on them with a permanent marker and it just erases with a standard white eraser. It would get the full 5 if it came with a marker and an eraser. You can only write on them with a Sharpie or other permanent marker. You do need to have a permanent marker and white eraser to use these. I wasn't sure how well the permanent marker would erase from the tabs but using a standard white eraser (unfortunately not included but I was able to pick one up pretty inexpensively at a local office store) does a great job of eliminating the writing so the tabs can be rewritten on. I wrote on the them with a Sharpie Permanent marker. The laundry marker did best.You get 8 each of the three positions of tab. Can use permanent marker however the eraser is not included.I do like the "super tab" (large tab area) and will probably use address labels to label each folder. If you have a permanent marker and white eraser and want to erase what you wrote on filing folders then this is the product for you.I was able to remove the marker with a tissue and the pressure of my fingernail but some people might not want to do this.
