I purchased this headset because my microphone port stopped working on my computer - the USB helps with that, obviously. I needed a USB headset to use on my laptop when I was out of office and have had nothing but positive feedback on my sound quality when using this for calls such as Skype or Google+ hangouts. Both of them immediately recognized the headset and was talking and listening in minutes.It is billed as being the best at working with Skype. I've also used the headset controlling on VATSIM, which is a virtual air traffic control environment. This is a nice headset - nothing fancy but gets the job done right. Not enough to return it, but bad enough to give the headset a perhaps generous three stars. I only use the headset with Skype and cannot speak to other uses, but I would not purchase this headset again. I use this headset on my work Mac Mini for Lync and Skype calls. Very good headset if you don't mind the wires! Overall, I'd recommend this headset with flying colors if you only intend to use these for online chatting.I used these as a standard pair of headphones for music and video games, and while they are acceptable in this capacity, they're definitely not going to impress you. Just what I expected from a headset. I'm actually somewhat disappointed that this headset connects to devices via USB. Overall the headset is quite functional. A headset should be comfortable to wear, provide good sound through the earpieces, capture and deliver sound well through the boom microphone. This headset does all of that. the headset fits nicely but goes get a little warm around the ears after awhile.

The headset is big enough to fit on larger noggins, and some with smaller heads may actually find it lose fitting.Music and Gaming VS. Skype:To use this headset with Skype you have to first go to Plantronics' website and download specific drivers that work with Skype.

The headset is compatible via USB with both PC's and MAC.

With this headset, nothing really comes to mind about what could be done to improve it.
