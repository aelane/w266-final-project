I got this binder in the green and liked it so much I went back and chose this Wedgewood blue one. With this binder, I can print off a title page and slip it into the front, print off the title and slip it into the spine, and if I want I can slip a relevant page into the back as well. The binder arrived in excellent condition, no damage from having frozen during transit, which was very nice. The binder mechanism itself is one of the easiest opening I have seen, just throw the blue lever. I filled this binder almost immediately and have been using it regularly for about a month now. I think this binder is strong and manages to hold a great deal of papers more securely (where they move more fluidly without coming loose) than a lot of cheaper alternatives. Truthfully I probably never would have paid this much for a binder this size, sight unseen. But since I needed a new binder and I could get this through VINE, I decided to go for it.First of all, I have arthritis in both hands and opening regular binders can be a big pain  (pun intended). My previous binder was also 1.5" like this one, but this one seems to have more room, probably because the rings are larger.I love the two pockets on both the back and front covers. I have been using this binder daily for almost a month, opening, closing, and adding more paper to it maybe five or six times a day. Right now my 1.5" binder is filled to capacity, and I still need to add more paper to it, so I just ordered the 3" version. When I opened up the binder, I did like what I saw. Large two inch binder. I use this binder in a recipe book project I am working on. This is a nice, durable binder. It seems more sturdy than your average binder. But that works better if the binder's back does not have the mechanism attached to the spine, but to the spine edge of the back cover. Now, when you open the binder, the back lies flat, and the pages are easy to manage.&#34;But&#34;, as they say on the late night TV commecials, &#34;wait! This binder is very durable and good looking. The binder rings open and close smoothly and securely. I highly recommend this binder. I have been using these binder for 10 years now. I would recommend this binder for either storage use wherein it is not opened often AND also for uses in which it IS opened and closed often. This binder is perfect for my needs! This binder is great. OR if you are looking for a binder that will hold a lot of pages, this is also an excellent choice.LOVE IT. This binder also comes with a 5 year guarantee. This sturdy binder could be filled with women, men, or whatever subject interests you. Well, it doesn't honestly feel all that different from your average binder. It's a nice binder, but not too special, so you could pick this one, but you could just as easily pick another...Update:  Well, after putting it to the test for school (I had to put a large loose-leaf textbook into it), I've found that the rings don't want to stay closed. This binder has a little integrity in its construction. This Wilson Jones binder has a single touch lever to open the 1-- 1/2 inch rings, and can hold 400 sheets. (Once a binder's rings get warped you may as well toss it to save the annoyance).There are clear sleeves allowing you to insert decorations/instructions/etc  on the front, spine and back, which is almost expected anymore. I did this with a similar binder recently and ended up adding stickers over my poor cut-jobOne cool feature is that the inner pockets are double pockets. this binder certainly seems sturdier than others on the market. I like the binder and would buy another if a need arose for me to do so. The binder holds more for its size and is a pleasure to use.I also like the four (or 2+ extra access) internal pockets. However, I had just started using the binder when one of the pockets began to bubble and looks like it might tear soon. This binder holds 525 sheets of paper. This is an extra durable binder and holds a substantial number of page protectors. My binder I bought at the beginning of fall semester last year was beginning to look rather old (and I was tired of seeing it), so I thought I'd give this one a try. Whether the binder covers will hold up for "years of reliable use" is yet to be seen, though I have high doubts. I have never had a binder with such bendable covers! I absolutely LOVE this Wilson Jones binder! The binder cover is deep enough to allow insertion of full sized letter pages yet protects the right edge of the pages. 1.5" binder. This binder is supposed to last 10x longer... than their basic binder. I picked up this binder because it was a heavy duty binder and needed one to store several hundred pages of notes and tests for a class that I teach. Overall the binder seems to be well constructed, the rings are sturdy, and the outside of the binder seems to be in good condition.However, this binder broke within a week of use. I am a self-confessed &#34;binder snob&#34; in that I use a lot of binders for my many files of hobby stuff, and I can't stand cheap or flimsy binders. I was very pleased to see that this did not happen with this binder. I would recommend this binder. This binder almost earns five stars, but at full capacity the hinges start to gape a bit. This durable binder fit my daughter's requirements for her school supply list, and it held up against a messy locker and all the back-and-forth between school and home. This binder is heavy duty, with a hinge that is easy to open with one finger. This binder is very heavy duty, and the hinges are great. This binder is a lovely baby blue color and has two plastic pouches on the inside of the back and front cover to put sheets of paper for separation from what is in the D-rings. Very nice binder and can hold a lot of notebook paper. I love this binder, its perfect. This binder is really durable. I highly recommend this binder when you're going to be using it regularly and need it to last. This 3 ring binder is great in the sense that I don't have to worry about pinching my fingers anymore. (The binder says it's got a 5-year warrantee, although I can't imagine anyone actually following up on that.) Overall, I would still recommend, due to the actual binder system. Ultra Duty it is not, it'sjust as thick as a regular binder, no thicker. This Wilson binder's strong hinge may make it more suitable for your needs. This is a GREAT binder. This binder I will use to try to organize lots of papers I have. It's a 3-ring binder. The binder opens and closes smoothly, and closes completely, unlike some other binders I have reviewed that remained slightly open allowing the papers to shift forward. All in all an excellent binder. I needed a binder to put all my financial records  in so that I'd have them in one place. Great binder! The exact same binder selling at another on-line nationwide office supply chain (with local brick& mortar stores as well) sells for $8.99. I usually look for the binder with the largest capacity. I was also hoping to have a binder that would allow me to slide a recipe into the front cover, far easier than leaving it lying around. I love this binder so much, I may never buy another style! This is the second Wilson Jones binder I own. If you are looking for a binder that is durable and will last, as well as easy to use and professional looking, I highly recommend looking at this line of Wilson Jones' binders. This binder has a very sturdy feeing. I absolutely love the Wilson Jones Ultra Duty D-Ring binder! Wilson's binder is exceptional! Not only does its binder clasp make it incredibly easy to open and close with one hand, but it is also very durable. I have filled this binder with many pages, opened and closed it excessively, dropped it, etc. This is a great durable binder that we have been using to hold my first-grader's math pages, so it gets quite a workout every day from him flipping pages. This binder has a smooth one touch opening and closing mechanism. The binder lays open flat and the creases in the binder seem well sealed and allow for the flat open laying. Specifically, does the binder fully accommodate ANY insert, protecting it along all of its outside edges, including top and bottom corners? This binder is very durable and easy to use for organizing a lot of sheets. This is a great binder. It appears that the binder took a hit at the bottom end which lightly crushed the cardboard inside and crinkled the polypro material, but it cracked the clear plastic about " up on the front and " up on the edge. I cannot recommend this binder. My binder hasn't broken yet, but I would not use it for anything resembling &#34;heavy duty.&#34;  The plastic does not feel high grade, and the covers bend easily. If your binder's tear apart more often then the Wilson Jones's tear resistance might be more helpful for you. I highly recommend this binder. I wouldn't bet on that but this specific binder that has the 4 inner pockets and outer customizable pockets seem to be a bit better quality than the ones without this outer pocket. Time will tell but I'd be surprised if these lasted much longer than any other binder out there. The binder has two overlapping pockets inside each cover, and, given the amount of material placed in each, there could be stretching and sagging there. This is a nice binder for the money. This binder is quite sturdy and feels like it will last me a while.

The binder opens flat, and pages on the right side lie very nicely.

The binder has clear plastic outer sleeves on the outside which permits you to insert personalized information.What makes a binder desirable is not just its appearance but also smooth hinges and high-quality rings that open and close reliably and smoothly.

This is a nicely made binder.
