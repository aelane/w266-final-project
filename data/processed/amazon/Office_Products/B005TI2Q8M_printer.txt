I have had this printer for a few months now. I had an HP printer that was huge and was not wireless. It was much more compact than my other printer and looked better. I immediately was able to find the printer on the network once I added it to the router. Mind you, prior to owning this printer, I would send an email from my laptop in the living room, the one I work on the most, to the computer in the office. The printer is a little noisy, but it does have a quiet feature. Overall, not bad for a printer if your needs are light to moderate. Purchased this printer to use for personal and business printing. I got this printer as an inexpensive low-end replacement for my home printer while I was away from home for an extended period. The printer was relatively easy to setup and use, even with the wireless network. I will buy a more expensive printer, if those I am sick of my printers and copiers. I like a printer who starts when I hit pringt without being turned on and they should shut off automaticly if not in use. This printer absolutely drinks ink like it's dying from dehydration. I ultimately ended up using the printer strictly as a USB connected device. I bought this printer at a local wholesale club and already this thing is giving problems. However, this printer has already pissed me off and I barely used it. It would not find the printer on my network and I have no idea how to solve this. So it's a printer, and printers aren't always super exciting, so I'll just focus on what makes this printer special.1.)

Well, if you are running FingerPrint, you can print to ANY printer using your iPhone, so this is a blatant misrepresentation.

Even using Network Magic, it just won't see the printer.
