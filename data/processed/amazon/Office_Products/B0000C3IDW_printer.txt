This is by far and away, the best printer I have ever owned. This printer kicks out black and white pages like it was laser printer. This printer is also remarkably quiet; almost to the point of being silent. This has to be the best printer I have had. I can't believe how good this printer is.Highly reccommend, can't go wrong. This printer printed out some of the best photos of my life--pictures when I first was dating my boyfriend, family photos, when my boyfriend proposed to me, our first big trip together, and yes, even my cute little doggie. The printer broke down after a year and a half of use. I had the HP Deskjet 990 CSE which is a great text printer but crappy on photos. If you are looking for an all purpose photo/text printer this is it!

Even using the printer tray, the pictures are not properly centered if you choose to have borders.

Get this printer if you're in the market for a printer that will handle text documents efficiently as well as print top quality photographs,(...).I printed out a borderless photo on the supplied sample of 4 x 6 paper and the quality is unbelievable.

I admit, I have been out of the printer loop for some time.
