Firstly, the product is great. But I wasn't sure how to use this product and most of the negative in this review is about that. This Desk File/Sorter is a quality product. Very good product. Great product, thx But the product description might give one the impression that it can be an A-to-Z or 1 thru 31 sorter. That's a different product (probably of the same good quality, but I wouldn't know).Enjoy! This is such a wonderful product for the office and its design is what makes it really special. When I ordered this product, I thought it was an expandable file with sides on it. I would love the product if the sides were enclosed. I just wish they had made the product with pockets or side guards so when it was portable the papers would be safe from falling out if dropped or carried wrong.

This product is very well made and is helping to get much better control over papers in my office.

Good product and should last a long time.ADDENDUM----I have been using this file folder now for several months and frankly don't know how I did without this one.
