I'm notorious for neat notes, and classmates are always asking to borrow them. They always remove cleanly, at least as well as Post-it notes. The notes had gone all curly and were seriously obstructing turning of neighboring pages. Considering that I normally use small Post-It notes as bookmarks, which are cheap, these might be a worthy investment simply because they last so much longer. These come in very handy when you want to make notes into a book that you don't want to be permanent. I've used them for my PTA notes, my daughter used some for her physics textbook, and to help organize her binders. They have more "stick-to-it-tiveness" than sticky notes, yet can be fairly easily moved. These are nice, I use them to organize my notes that I take after reading a book.My workflow is as follows:Buy book (usually from amazon)Read book, highlight useful information with highlighter (yellow)Mark important parts with my pen or pencil (desecration, i know i know)Mark the especially important pages with post-it flags (best invention ever).After reading the book, think about it a while, go back over the book, re-read the highlighted parts, the marks with pen or pencil, and the parts with post-it flags.Copy over the best info into my computer - by typing out notes.Print said notes -> Attach to binder, and use these (along with more highlighting) on the especially good parts.With a system like this you can extract the value out of a book and make it extremely useful.I may highlight 1-2 paragraphs a page or every 3-5 pages (some books may only have 1 passage highlighted in the entire book if its terrible, while some may be almost completely highlighted! I've always used the small sticky notes, marked with numbers, to help me turn to the next song quickly and accurately. They are working much better than the post-it notes that I had been using. I can write notes on them "on the page" for a quick reference.The only problem I have with them is the ink in the pens I use (Uniball Vision Elite) doesn't dry on it quickly and I smear it quite a bit. AND you can make notes on the tab! Sticky notes by themselves look a little less professional than flags. I've long used regular post-it notes to keep track of recipes in my books and over time these fall out, bend and become an unruly mess. As Post-it notes came into use, I was able to mark not just a page, but the general area on the page that was of interest. I will no longer be using ripped up sticky notes as page markers for my cookbooks! I have used regular sticky notes to mark pages in my textbooks.
