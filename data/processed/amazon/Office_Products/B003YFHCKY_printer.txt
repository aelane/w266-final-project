I'm very happy with the Brother TN450 printer, and, I suppose, by extension, with this toner cartridge. Usually It feels cheaper to buy a new printer than to get a replacement toner cartridge but with my brother printer and this high yield cartridge, it makes it worth while to get the toner and reuse my printer.Here are my print counts:Printed 1556 pages before low toner message appearAnother 543 pages before it told me to replace tonerThen after shaking the cartridge and overriding the replace toner by pressing the Go button 7 timesI was able to print another 276 pages. The only black and white printer that I have used in 7 years is a Brother model, the only toner that I have used in thoseprinters is the manufactures toner. We've had our Brother printer for a few years, and the first cartridge lasted nearly that whole time. We use the printer for school/work/home office needs. Therefore, I am forced to use them in the printer. the printer has worked very well and no problems with the toners. I use my printer a lot and use a lot of ink. Also, sometimes the printer does not recognize the generic cartridge immediately after installation, so you have to remove and replace it a few times, or reboot the printer a few times.

I have a spare printer, so it wasn't a problem for me, but if you don't have a spare printer, don't wait too long to order a replacement cartridge.Amazon's prompt shipping helped.

They jam the printer every other page, so I stopped using them.

I love the Brother printer I have, and this toner.
