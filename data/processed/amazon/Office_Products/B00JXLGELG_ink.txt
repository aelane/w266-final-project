I shouldn't have to replace the yellow ink cartridge if I am only printing something in black. This should be a real ink and cost saver.You can print up to 13 X 19 copies on this printer and the scanner will scan up to 11 X 17. Most ink jet printers are made to excel in either photo printing or text and graphics, not in both. Epson's ink cartridges, and photo paper, cost per color print is way too high. The 7620 uses Epson 252 ink cartridges,  so far they seem somewhat rare on Amazon but I found they are readily available at our neighborhood chain office supply. The ink tanks/cartridges for the WF-7620 are barely larger than the ink cartridges for a standard 8.5x11 home office printer. After being prompted to install the ink cartridges, the printer will take approximately five minutes to initialize before it is ready to go. The ink is smudge proof and even a wet finger couldn't smear the text.I tried to print Avery labels but that did not work for me. It uses 4 ink cartridges, and I have not used up the ink I have so I cannot vouch for how fast it uses ink. The ink did not smudge.MEMORY CARDThe beauty of the touchscreen is I can see the photos right on the screen using my SD card and flash drive. They all use the same ink tank. It uses 252 ink cartridge. It'll prime the ink for several minutes and then it'll tell you to load the paper.
