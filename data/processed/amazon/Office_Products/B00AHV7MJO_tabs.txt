The tabs are extra sturdy, and you could, of course, stick permanent labels on them. The tabs on the Smead folders are definitely wide and measure approximately 4" x 3/4". Do the erasable tabs work? These tabs are easy to write on; but, it is hard to clean them off so they look 'new' again before writing.I probably should have expected that - but I was hoping it would be more like writing on a white-board.Overall, I love the idea - and I think they'll appeal to a lot of people. I love that the tabs are bigger and give you more room to write. The rewritable tabs are smudgeproof; it actually takes a bit of elbow grease to erase when you've written on them with a Sharpie. The tabs on the folders are bigger then usual indeed, but the erasable surface is narrower then the tab, so it is possible to miss and write on the outside, and not being able to erase that.I tried to write with regular black permanent marker, and then erase - the white eraser did work, but required a lot of effort, and I had a lot of eraser shavings and the eraser was visibly reduced in size. Those tabs expect that you A. know where those stupid plastic tabs are and B. plan to write on little tiny pieces of white card stock that you will then fold and slip inside the tabs. No more plastic tabs to insert! But you eliminate those darn hard-to-work-with platic tabs. We all lose those, break the tabs, or lose the paper inserts. The erasable tabs are a nice feature that allow me to write in ink and edit later. The tabs on Smead's Erasable FasTab Hanging Folders work  as described. I wrote on the tabs with a Sharpie Permanent marker. Oh, I loathe those little plastic tabs that go in slots at the top of a hanging folder. The "erasable" tabs are not something I like all that much (I will probably use address labels to label each folder)The built in tab for these hanging folders is GREAT!I also really like the light green color -- a nice subtle change from the ugly dark green standard color.
