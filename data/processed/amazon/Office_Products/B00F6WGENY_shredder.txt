We had a standard shredder for our home office but this one is faster and just cuts through the paper with no  problems or delays. A shredder is always a great investment for your home. Good shredder that is about equivalent to my Amazon Basics shredder. This shredder is rated for 14 sheets and handles that job easily. The Aurora is a very loud shredder and it gets a lot louder if it has been running for awhile. But this Swingline shredder has a pull out basket, and since I keep it on the floor, I don't notice on the front peek window when it is nearing full. I like this shredder even more than I thought I would. My other shredder cuts them into many more pieces. Very happy with this shredder, the cross shred is a very secure shred so good for private documents. Let me mention that this shredder replaced an Aurora I had a bought a few years ago. Better than my Amazon Basics shredder. Also, unlike the Amazon Basics shredder, this unit's auto shut off feature seems to work consistently. This shredder has a pull out drawer for emptying. This shredder eats up staples, and even the occasional missed paper clip. The whole shredder, in fact, is much more substantial than the photo indicates.I highly recommend this shredder.

This shredder has a basket that pulls out and inside an insert smaller basket to gather the shredded disks.

It is a Cross Cut shredder and does not have the high security of a micro cut.

This is a SERIOUS shredder!
