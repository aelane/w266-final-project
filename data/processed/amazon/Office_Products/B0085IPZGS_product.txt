You will notice in the on-line product description there is the word MO right after the the word Smead There is no explanation what MO means but here is one that seems fitting. I honestly cannot fathom why this is even a product for sale when you can get huge boxes full of folders for the same price.Oh--it does contain a list of 11 quick tips to simplify life, including "Reduce debt - get rid of all your credit cards except one", "Cut back on TV", "For every item you purchase, donate 2", "Disconnect electronically for short periods of time", etc. This is a great product if you are just starting some type of filing system or even if you have a system in place. I know Franklin Covey has a similar My Organizer product, and I love the concept and the sheet of organizational tips, and hints for simplifying and getting rid of the clutter is a nice touch. Not a bad product by any means but not one to go completely nuts over either. This is an excellent product for the novice organizer, but experienced people will appreciate it as well.First, the kit comes with nine assorted color "SuperTab standard letter size folders". The product bills itself a "Starter Kit," there to simplify your life by organizing your important medical and financial records. This product gets you started, you can take it from here. This is very much a good/bad product depending on your personal needs.

This product, however, leaves a lot to be desired.

This product is aimed at people who aren't sure how to begin a filing system.

I think it is a little expensive for the actual product in the kit, but it seems to have germinated and grown larger than the thin plastic sealed collection of folders I received.
