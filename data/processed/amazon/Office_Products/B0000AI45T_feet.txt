Therefore, my feet dangle off the edge of my chair. I could fit three more feet of my size 8 feet on this rest. It's because I've been putting my feet on the chair rests and I have had no foot rests. I'm not sure what he did with it, but it sure isn't under his feet. I just can't stand to sit without putting my feet up on something. I put my feet on the footrest, adjusted my keyboard and typed----it felt good to type with a footrest.My boss asked me to show him the footrest: I said it's just a footrest. Do you put your feet up while you're working? Tuck your feet in your chair, prop them on the desk, smash the piles of books by resting on them? It's simple and sturdy and comes fully assembled.Once you begin using it, you'll be glad to find that it adjusts easily -- you can just push it with your feet into the height and angle that you prefer -- no need to get up and take a screwdriver to it. It's wide and long enough to be able to comfortably place both feet on it. Your feet will be gripped on the surface whether you wear shoes or, are barefoot. I usually end up sitting cross-legged or with my feet resting on the chair legs. At first I thought it was a little too high as I'm used to sitting with my feet on the floor. I have large feet, and am a fairly big guy, so I was worried that the pad would be small (and as a result not comfortable or convenient).

I have repeatedly scraped my feet on the edge of the footrest.

Your feet are in a good ergonomic position.

While my feet are on this, my posture in the chair is improved by sitting all the way back in the seat.
