It does come with a simple, but easy to use dispenser. This dispenser is much easier to use since there's not much to it. The dispenser does have a nice, handy cutting bar, but the truth is, you don't necessarily need the tearing bar. While the dispenser on this tape is not as great as the scotch, the tape is actually on par. * The green dispenser bugs me. I don't mind the disposable dispenser, but I'm bothered by the notion that "green is better".Anyway, the tape is good. However, this dispenser indeed was EASY and the tape has stayed where it's supposed to, and - just as advertised - it is completely frustration free! The dispenser is easy to use, and the tape is thick and strong. The dispenser worked perfectly for me, and the price is comparable to similar products. The dispenser is a cheap plastic but it does the trick. The dispenser also makes it easy to tape up packages. It is unusally easy to install in the dispenser, unwinds unusually easy and quietly, and cuts unusually easy.If you do alot of packaging in a quiet environment, such as a library, then this tape may be advantageous, it does not "screeeeeech" as it comes off the roll. The dispenser cuts the tape really well.
