The boxes are cardboard, so are not a wonder to look at, but they feel pretty sturdy. Because the boxes are not connected together the top one will tip while open unless you have weight on top, hence my weight test with the cat. Connecting the boxes could be as simple as twine or heavy tape, but perhaps something should have been included since they are meant to be stacked.Assembly was fairly easy, though logically challenged people might have a little bit of trouble. The boxes are longer than the typical 2-drawer filing cabinet in most homes: letter sized box external size is 25.5in x 14in x 11.5in. The boxes can be useful as filing drawers with hanging folders and/or drawers to hold items that will simply lay inside. Currently I have three boxes stacked next to my TV to organize video games and controllers (my durability test that will be updated here if they fail), while the other three boxes will be for paper files elsewhere (unfortunately they did not fit where I wanted to put them). The boxes were fairly easy to assemble, taking roughly about 2-3 minutes per box - once you have the procedure down.2. These boxes are large and will get heavy quickly.Overall, if you want your files in something that works better than a normal cardboard box but aren't willing to make the financial commitment to an actual file system, these may be a good option. These boxes are heavy duty file drawers. If you like banker boxes you know some of the cheaper ones are, well cheap! In the bottom boxes I have put all my tax returns and supporting documentation for some forty years. The top boxes are my "throw away" boxes. The boxes, however, do not connect. These boxes were fairly easy to assemble along with their sleeves.
