All-in-all its a good product with no issues I can see. This Laptop Lift is an interesting product. This product holds the laptop at the wrong angle for me, resulting in blurred images and eyestrain.For someone with younger, healthier eyes, it should not be a problem. This product lifts my laptop to the perfect height, but the angle of the height is a bit too steep. This product would be perfect if it allowed the user to adjust the resting angle. Other than that,  there is no assembly required so you basically are ready to go as soon as you receive the product. Again, this product is great if the angle of the lift doesn't affect you in a negative manner. I was unsure when I first ordered this product, as the tilt (as seen in the photo), looks quite drastic. This product has definitely become a favorite for me.

So this product is really not meant to be used by typing directly on the laptop's keyboard, nor is it designed to be placed on your lap like a lapdesk.Along with improving the viewing height of the laptop screen, the other advantage that most laptop risers offer is that they improve the airflow circulation underneath the laptop to keep it ventilated better.

This is a great product that I do recommend as a great addition to any office to ease typing.
