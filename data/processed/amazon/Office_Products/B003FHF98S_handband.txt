I have used the handband dispensers before and I like the idea but always found them to be a little awkward to wear. The handband dispenser was pretty helpful when I was on the floor wrapping a big box--the dispenser was always within my reach and allowed me freedom to wrap. The handband dispenser is perfect for gift wrapping and I might even wrap some presents myself this year instead of letting my wife do them all! The handband dispensers need to be filled before use. But I hadn't yet tried the "handband" pop-up tape dispenser, so was happy to see this bulk package that contains two handband dispensers + two deskgrip dispensers + six tape-strip refill pods.Scotch is high-quality tape and I like the convenience of the precut strips. The handband dispenser is refillable with the enclosed (and widely available) little pods of tape strips. The handband dispenser was easy to fill with tape (there are six refills) and it fits snugly over my left wrist. I've had the handband versions for years and love them. The handband dispenser is refillable; however, the deskgrip dispenser is not. I find wearing the handband across the back of my hand comfortable and the elastic strap readily adjusts for a good fit.The desk dispenser is an interesting addition to the group of wrapping implements, but probably my least favorite. I've been using Scotch handband dispensers every year for the past several years around Christmas specifically for the purpose of wrapping presents. I've had the handband dispensers before and they're pretty handy (no pun intended).
