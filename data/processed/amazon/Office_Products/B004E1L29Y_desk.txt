And I love all the extra desk space I have now.The only drawback is that I had to get used to reaching for my mouse in another location. I decided that my light-weight desk would not hold up the keyboard tray and am sending it back. The old one was so deep it didn't fit on my main desk because of the panel under the desk that drops down midway back (do they call that a privacy panel or something?). After settling on a different desk instead of shipping this back--one made of a solid, heavier wood--I installed this with the help of a measuring tape and electric drill and manual screw driver (the drill was to make a hole to screw the screw into! I have a large desk but a really small keyboard tray/drawer. I was about to get rid of my desk and get a new one just because of the drawer and this solved the problem. I have a built in desk and I've been needing one of these for a long time because it's too high for comfort to use mouse on desk part and really hard to type like that. My little desk has me squished enough and adding this just took over everything. I almost want to buy a new desk to go with this tray! I mounted to my desk at work, which is solid. Some desk are made of hollow materials or have very little to drill into, so make sure your desk will accommodate the tray. which makes it simple to screw into your desk. Also, make sure your desk is strong enough and not cheaply made.I use a oversized gaming keyboard and the tray holds it with plenty of room. I have been using a small desk for my computer and had to keep the keyboard and mouse on the top of the desk as it had no pull-out tray or drawer. I envision trying to install this on an inexpensively made desk and the tray tumping the entire desk over. Besides the obvious that you could not mount it to a glass-top desk, you should also be aware that many desks made today have a hollow core top (much like an interior door in your house). can be skewed from being square with the desk)* Decent, but not totally smooth, height adjuster. Bought this for my desk. If you have a desk with a crappy keyboard tray one of these could totally transform your desk for you too. I'm glad I chose this desk as the Fellowes Pro Series Keyboard (and mouse) tray is almost insanely heavy-duty.

If your desk has drawers on either side you need to measure the opening.If you have a center desk drawer this will not work unless you remove the drawer.Your desk needs to be fairly sturdy, the tray is heavy.Folded under the desk you lose about 3-4 inches.It will actually raise slightly higher (about a half inch) than your desktop if you desire.The mouse part does not move independently (some people like the keyboard at a differentangle than the mouse).This is a solid product and well designed.

When I first got it I did not have a desk suitable for it so it went unused for the longest time.

Once done, I glued and screwed this into the desk bottom and mounted the tray unit per the instructions.
