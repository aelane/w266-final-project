This is the perfect dispenser for the gals who love pink, and I happen to know one. Not only is this dispenser great for dispensing Post-It pop-up notes, it makes a geat paperweight and is very attractive. This dispenser was quite a bit larger than I expected, measuring about 5 1/4" square, and is rather heavy. This dispenser is really cute. The dispenser is about 4" high by 6" across, so it is quite large and it takes the pop-up post-its not the standard type. With the dispenser you have a pad of 50 included with the dispenser. It is easy to pop the dispenser apart by hitting the little lever on the back of the unit. This is a really fun and cute dispenser. So besides being a dispenser, it is also a paperweight. It is very easy to open the dispenser to re-load. This Post-it dispenser earns its desktop space by being both functional and attractive. The dispenser is heavy enough to stay put when pulling a note out one handed. The dispenser has excellent weight to it and makes not only a fun note dispenser but a great paper weight too.While it might not have a very professional look about it, I'm sure it will fit in just fine on most desks either in the office, at home, or in the dorm.You have to refill it with Post-It Pop-Up notes only. This dispenser is attractive and it works. This dispenser is a lot larger than the other dispensers that I have seen but it has a really nice weight to it to make it the ideal paper weight. I imagined a cute little dispenser of post-it notes that could sit on my daughter's desk. I love this Post-It Notes dispenser! This dispenser is really nice looking , especially for a young girl. The dispenser is heavy and well constructed, not some cheap/light plastic. I chose this cute pink post-it dispenser for my daughter in college thinking it would look good on her desk. This is a cute dispenser designed exclusively for use with Post-it Pop-up Notes, the kind that are connected zig-zag style (below, I've shared a tip for using it with other stickies). Then, load them into the dispenser as directed.The heft of this product is impressive; even though it's plastic it feels sturdy, and it sits still when sheets are removed, so that it does the work of one hand (holding the pad). This is a very nice looking and sturdy dispenser.
