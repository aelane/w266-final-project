They came out with clean edges - I could neither see nor feel any roughness whatsoever. The clean edges are a plus on these - some other inject printer cards look awful because of their perforated edges. These always looked jagged on the edges, printed on a poor quality paper with the print quality that screamed cheap home printer. The Clean Edge turned out to be just that - almost completely smooth edges on par with the professionally printed cards. They really break off with clean edges and it's so easy, too. They were "fuzzy" around the edges. These have good edges. The edges of the cards are far more smooth than earlier Avery stock, and there are no rough spots or hanging bits of fiber after separating the cards.While there are those who advise against printing your own cards instead of having them professionally printed, I would say that the flexibility and functionality of using these cards far outweighs any negative. The edges on these cards are simply amazing. First, the edges are not as sharp as a cut card. I'm always skeptical of "clean edges", but this product delivered. The edges are very clean and neat, which seems to be the main selling point for these cards. You just fold all 4 edges of the sheet to remove the borders, then separate each card by folding them where they join. I remember the ragged edges of prior cards, none of that here.
