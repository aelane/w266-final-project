I would recommend this printer to anyone who has multiple computers and a wireless network.Special printing:I would not recommend this printer if you do a lot of  multiple page 2-sided printing. I was happy to try this printer for those rare occasions when I do need to print in color, particularly as it came complete with high-capacity ink cartridges that I hoped would last a good, long time.Overall, I was impressed with this all-in-one. This is a great printer. The printer is extremely easy to setup using the quick guide full of diagrams, easy to navigate through the menus, change settings, and setup the WiFi to allow devices to print to the device wirelessly. But as a personal printer in a business workplace, this printer works exceptionally well. I've never had a wireless printer, so it's really nice to not have to run up to the office every time I want to print. The printer is finally working to print via the USB connection. This printer came with #127 high capacity cartridges so I hope they last a long time as they appear to be rather pricey and you have to buy 4 separate ones. I hate having to use my printer sparingly just to save money on ink!I will update this review within a couple of weeks after I have used the printer and all its features. * Printer* Plug* Installation CD and Instructions* All four printer cartridges: Black, Cyan, Yellow, Magenta* Free paper from CreativeZoneII. JUDGMENT CALL:I absolutely love this printer! This is a wonderful all-in-one printer but as you look into the price on Amazon, there is nearly a $60-$70 difference between both the 630 vs. the 635.Both are exact machines with the exception that the 635 does two-sided printing. This printer is highly recommended! Installing the printer drivers on a client computer and then registering the printer on a home network can be completed in about 30 minutes. This printer with good photo paper makes for excellent cheap prints too. I love this printer. After using the printer for about a month I have not had any issues with it dropping off the network which has consistently been a problem with Lexmark and HP all-in-ones that I have used.My only complaint was in regards to installing the software onto a Windows 7 64-bit computer. This printer will operate with both Windows and Mac systems. After installing the printer driver, rebooting, and then installing the scanner driver, all was well. But I have now been using this printer for approximately a year, so I feel like I have a good foundation of experience with it. When I received this printer, I actually had my eye on the Canon printer. This printer is currently selling at the same or similar pricepoint, so be sure to do your research! The printer is fast and quieter than most printers (especially my Kodak) and good at copying as well. Yes this printer is WiFi ready, but I am not. I was excited about upgrading my "all-in-one" printer to this new high performance Wi-fi all-in-one printer. Getting the printer to work over Wifi wasn't difficult at all, and I was surprised. This printer is advertised as being "fast", but it seems as if it is operating on "draft" mode as a default. It's a rather large and bulky printer. As soon as this printer arrived, we set it up (very easily) and tested the quality of printing. I love this printer. I really like moving up to a wireless printer with a paper cartridge! I also like being able to hide the printer somewhere besides on my desktop. Put the printer anywhere you want!- Scanning is easy. I have to say - this is a great printer. It is a very good all-purpose printer. That is the only other printer of this type I have to compare the Epson to. The printer came with full cartridges of ink - all of them - unlike the usual trial size that accompanies a new printer.What I didn't like about it was that neither I nor a second user of the printer could ever get it to load and operate as a wireless unit, which was to me the most attractive feature of the Epson 630. Epson WorkFouce 630 Injet Printer and ScannerI find this to be an average printer with the software being below average.QualityOut of the box there is a lot of plastic wrap and tape that has to be removed. The printer yields very quick and professional documents in both color and black and white. So far we have only used this comprehensive printer for  a few weeks but aside from the problems with the software install we are very satisfied. I recently moved this printer from one room where it did not get used too often to a room where I do my scrapbooking and printing pictures for scrapbooks. This is a printer that's easy to set up and connects easily to your wireless network; I have not had any problems with it. Overall, a very nice printer with a lot of great features, a nice design, and good printing/scanning speed. UPDATE - 10/4/2012:  I've had this printer 19 months and I still have the original ink cartridges installed. I didn't bother hooking it up by a printer cable (not included) the first time as the quick-start guide recommended, there's no need to do it that way if you plan on going wireless with this.My first attempt at printing the Epson Test Page had a slight snag as I had not installed the "letter size" paper correctly; once I pushed the side tabs inward, the page printed.
