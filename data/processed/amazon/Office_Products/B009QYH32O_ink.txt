The ink is slightly lighter than I'd like as well. The ink line is black, but not particularly sharp or distinct. It leaks ink. An ink stain on the small finger side of my left hand spoke with loud volume about how messy I was. Finally, the pressurized ink means that the pen is always ready to go and will not run dry when I'm writing on paper I'm holding against a vertical wall.Now, if your situation is more run-of-the-mill, this might not be the best choice for you. Since the ink is pressurized, the pen does not need to rely on gravity. You don't have to worry about ink on your shirt with this pen.It's a very wide pen, like maybe the size of a Sharpie, and it has a rough surface on the part you hold to write with. The ink width is .007 which is a bit thin, but that's what I use all the time (I especially like the Pilot  P-700 fine pen--it writes very smoothly and enjoyably ?? Black ink and a fine point, no clogging or blotches when using it. I've found Space Pen ink builds up around the writing ball, making a mess unless constantly cleaned.For actual writing, I've always preferred Pilot ballpoint pens, which have always worked flawlessly for me.So it's great to now have this Pilot pen with a pressurized feed done right. The black ink is not quite dark enough for my tastes, and the retraction mechanism is a bit bulky.
