The "D" shaped rings allow you to store more paper than a typical ringed binder. The rings open easily and close firmly, whereas some ringed binders stop closing flush over time, making turning pages a problem. The "EZD" rings, which are D-shaped, make it much easier to file a large number of pages and have them lie completely flat. While the rings of this binder are 2", the spine is 3" wide, which is pretty big, but perfect for my own use. The rings are super easy to open and they are large enough to carry a great deal of papers/folders. The rings often wouldn't close completely so when turning pages the pages would get stuck or come out. The inside rings are easy to open! (2) The rings often wouldn't close completely so when turningpages the pages would get stuck or come out. It allows you to open the rings when you want to with a light pull on the tab. Secondly, the D-shaped rings manage papers during the opening and closing much better than simple circular rings do. The rings are very easy to open but not accidentally. The rings are "D" shaped which Avery says will hold 50% more than the round rings, and looking at them I can see that this is right. The rings are a happy upgrade too. The rings are opened by depressing only one lever at the bottom end of the spine, which is really handy if your left or right hand is holding the paper. I also appreciate that there binder rings don't gap, so you don't have to worry about pages falling out or tearing. I am able to open and close the rings with just the pressure of my thumb, yet they still close with the precision and power of a medieval torture device.This model has four pockets-- two on the inside of each cover. If you're going to be using opening and closing the rings often, I'd recommend spending a little more and going with this one. The rings snap together tightly with no gaps and no mis-alignments.

I am a little afraid to open them using the rings themselves based on another review that said it ruined the rings.

The rings and spine felt secure, however, I do wish the front/back/spine paperboard was a bit sturdier.Turning the pages was, more often than not, smooth due to the gapless rings.

The EZD rings make it very easy to flip through pages and so far there is no overlapping of the rings or gaps like some binders get in time.
