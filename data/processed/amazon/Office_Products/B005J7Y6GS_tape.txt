The tape backing paper is split in the center for easy peeling, though some types of tape are easier than others.The LW-400 can print several types of labels. You do need to take up excess tape by rolling it (a la old cassette tapes) or it won't print right. and inserted a tape cartridge. Changing tape is easy on both units and both accept the same wide variety of tape media (bearing in mind that the LW-300 is limited to a maximum tape width of 1/2").Having said all that -- and even though I'm impressed by the printing capabilities of both of these units -- I am disappointed in the print quality. There is somewhat less wasted tape so the price evens out quite a bit if you print many short labels. They make it extremely clear that they want to waste label tape. And the colored tape - oh la la! The tape seems to stick without any problem on all of those surfaces. You don't lose any tape when you switch from one to another. It cuts tape closer to the text on the label thereby reducing the waste of a long blank leader. I would definitely purchase extra tape though - because the one that comes with it does not last that long. Accepts 4 different tape widths8. The easy to remove split-back tape is universal between all the machines. The additional tape width is apparently to make the label stand out, or to help in adhering to the surface to which it is attached; it is not to make the font bigger.These new labelers take a little getting used to. The tape is a nice size but using 1 line (goes up to 4, but that makes the print really small! I also like that I'm not wasting tape on extra long leaders.

Epson will also be offering colored tape, tape in different widths, glow-in-the-dark tape, and even iron-on tape that you might use for uniform nametags.One of the big selling points with this label maker is that it uses relatively small margins on either end, meaning waste is relatively minimal.

While unnecessary, I think it looks better.I tried looking for tape cartridge refills on Epson's web site and on Amazon, without success.

The tape does seem to be available in Europe.
