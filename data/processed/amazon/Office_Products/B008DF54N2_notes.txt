Great for leaving notes, assisting with organizing, labeling, and many more activities. If you love Post-it notes, you will love this roll. I like it for making notes as I read; I can tailor the size to the amount of writing I put on it. I write reminder notes to myself to leave on my computer monitor and have used it to mark documents. I have used this to write important notes to myself and place them on my laptop; unlike post-it notes, there's no free edge to keep getting in the way. I also made several notes to myself and stuck it by the computer screen. Like regular Post-Its, it can be used to leave notes or annotate documents.Overall, it has earned a permanent home in my desk. I stick notes to the front door so my husband will see it before he leaves the house: Don't Forget Your Lunch! I have Post-it notes all over my computer with a pack of them on the wall behind me along with a pen so I can write things down things that I need to remember. Post-It notes usually fall off and tape takes the polyurethane off when you remove it. Just like Post-It notes, it doesn't leave goop when removed. It's stickier than Post-It notes, so it stays put pretty well, yet comes off cleanly when you want it to. If you want odd-sized post-it notes, this is the product for you. I tried the sticky notes that are all adhesive (as opposed to just the strip at the top) and they stay put very well, but many times I have to cut them into pieces when I don't need a whole note page. The notes adhered well to all surfaces and came off without leaving adhesive behind.

I put Post-It notes on everything and couldn't be more pleased with a product.
