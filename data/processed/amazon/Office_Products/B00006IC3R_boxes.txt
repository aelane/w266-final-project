I love these boxes. These boxes were designed to store file folder and documents, but after opening them and putting them together, I have to say, I plan to use them for a whole lot more. Moving boxes are generally very large and we have a tendency to overjam them. These boxes fold very easy to fold, are durable, sturdy, and really secure. These boxes are easy to assemble and hold a surprising amount of stuff and stay strong. The boxes are also super simple to put together. And if you don't need all the boxes, you can keep the unused ones flat for easy storage. These boxes are great. Truly, nice to have boxes for anything you may need to store. Ordinarily I go for the cheaper Office Max boxes, but I wanted to try something sturdier for boxes of books that weren't headed for the used book store. These boxes are sturdy enough to be stacked. Comparing to the boxes with the string and button, I might prefer those slightly over these with the removable lid, but different items require different times to be open, so each has it's own benefits.The boxes are easily assembled and as the title of the item indicates, medium duty.Aside from the price, which seems a bit steep (but what doesn't today) these boxes and their mates with the string and button, are perfect unless you going to fill them full of extremely heavy items and stack them to the ceiling. These boxes are solidly constructed and are really easy to assemble. These medium-duty boxes live up to the company's well-deserved reputation. The only negative I can find about these boxes is the 24 inch length, too long for regular shelves and a bit too heavy for me to pick up when full. I need to use extra-duty boxes for them. These boxes are easy to assemble, easy to carry and easy to stack. These boxes are easy to assemble except the protective pieces that fold into the carrying holes don't fold into holes well making them awkward to use. You may want two smaller boxes instead. The boxes are easy to put together and I especially like the double thick bottom.
