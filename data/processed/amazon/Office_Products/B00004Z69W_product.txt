I just let the printed product sit a few minutes, just in case the laserjet ink was still wet (I've actually tried to smudge a few labels after printing on a laserjet, and the ink did NOT smudge at all). This gives the finished product a professional look without the professional price.Though we've gone through many of these over the years, I've only just got to write a review for this recently. I highly recommend this product. A great product, but a little pricey for those on a budget. All in all, a great product for mailings. Highly recommended product! I have to give this product 3 stars because these labels are not "super clear" more closer to "clear-frost". I highly recommend this product for anyone using address labels but want it to look like the type is right on the envelope. Overall this a great product for anyone needing to mail a large quantity of letters or invitations. It isn't a product I'd buy again.I don't think the cost is worth the product and is not something I'd recommend. I received this product through the Amazon Vine program. I was pleased to have this product come up in the Vine Newsletter since I replaced my laser with an Epson 810 inkjet all in one.
