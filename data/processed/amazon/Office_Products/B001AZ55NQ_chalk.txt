Holds standard chalk with no trouble. Very easy to change the chalk with the push of a button. If the chalk happens to get pushed too far in, the push button cap is removable. I've also discovered that the Prang chalk is much easier to erase and smoother to write with than Crayola. Since I don't use the colored chalk as often, it's perfect for those and I can still keep the chalk off mine and the kids hands. Wonderfully made, works perfectly so far, and with dustfree chalk, wow! However, the chalk slips down when you are writing and this isn't good because I spend too much time to bring it back up over and over. Not the best chalk holder. You need more chalk--you press, voila!My one issue is that the chuck COULD be a little tighter. It grabs chalk without a problem and doesn't slip. I usually retract my chalk inside it before tossing it in my bag so chalk doesn't get everywhere and I have a piece in case the room doesn't the next go around. This is the chalk  holder you want.
