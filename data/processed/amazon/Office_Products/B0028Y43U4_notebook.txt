Rather than simply place your notebook in your 3-ring and watch the holes get torn during use, Mead has added tabs to the backing to secure the notebook to 3-ring binders. This is a nice Five Star notebook with perferated college ruled paper.Pros:Front Cover - The front cover is a durable attractive plastic that should hold up well to basic wear, tear and use.Pockets - There are two pockets just inside the front cover on a thick cardboard like "page", one on each side. This makes it a little more useful than a standard notebook in that you could store papers there like a binder.Binder Options - You can attach it into a binder using the obvious 3 binder holes or you can reverse it and place it in ring side out using the Hook-N-Go flip out tabs located in the back cover. When it comes down to it that's all it is, just a notebook, but the little extras and quality make it a nice one to have. Unless you only need an ultra-cheap notebook (with flimsy covers and non-perforated paper) the Five Star notebooks are worth a look. Inside the notebook, the five star people have put in a couple of pockets so your handouts can stay with the notes.Tucked in binding wire. There is no other notebook brand that can compete with Five-Star quality. This Five Star notebook is pretty sturdy, with a vinyl-like plastic cover, and two folder pockets to store papers. This notebook is made with a durable plastic front cover and a cardboard back with the Hook 'N Go feature. Each notebook contains 100 college ruled pages -- perforated with three hole punch.The strangest thing about the perforated pages is that throughout the 100 page notebook, only every other page was perforated. First, how hard is it really to just keep the notebook inside the binder without attaching it? Second, to actually write in the notebook while it's clipped in the binder, you've got to open the back cover out, so the notebook is essentially next to, not enfolded in, the binder (otherwise you'll be writing with your wrist over the looseleaf rings half the time).

You can write in the notebook while it's attached by opening the binder and then opening the notebook to the left--in which case the notebook and binder combined take up a surface area of three 8-1/2 x 11 sheets of paper side by side.The notebook comes with two inside pockets.

Some may bristle at paying this much for a notebook, but it is certainly one of the best ones you can find.

Basically this allows you to latch the notebook into any 3 ring binder.
