The labels themselves have a thin film coating that starts to peel off after the label comes out (almost immediately) and that seemed to be the culprit.The 500TS has an impressive array of customizations with 25 font sizes for 10 fonts. if you're obsessed with labels beyond basic texts, this is it. this is fantastic if you want the best-looking labels or need barcodes. It makes very good labels, but both the PC and onboard functions are difficult to find or remember. No more wasted labels because you guess wrong on how the finished product will render. It uses Dymo D1 labels which are available in various widths up to one inch. The labels are about the same price as Brother Z labels. I like to put labels on everything and Brother's unit has yet to fail me. Besides making labels for file folders very easily, we use it for labels on our canning jars, and my husband's homemade wines. However, the labels are a bit "pixel-y", but still durable like the Brother's labels.The Dymo looked and felt impressive right out of the box, but I had trouble getting the battery installed. The labels are crisp, clear and durable. You can then print your labels in batches of up to 500 at a time. The D-1 labels required for this machine are not cheap. The labels are easy to read and stick where you put them. It prints LARGE labels and you can do all kinds of stuff with fonts, graphics, multiple lines, barcodes... the options seem pretty endless. Designing labels with the computer allows for use of a standard keyboard, and allows for downloading clip art graphics from several sources or from other input devices such as a scanner. It allows you to create labels with PC and print directly to the label maker. It can save your favorite labels to be recalled for later usage. I made great looking labels quickly and was impressed with the feature set. It allows you to create labels with your PC and print directly to the label maker. You can also save labels so that you don't have to re-create a previous format that you created.Since I teach and am mostly interested in using this for classroom organizational purposes, I haven't yet looked into how to interface this with a desktop computer, but the instruction manual makes it seem like it would be easy to do. That said, this one works well, is rugged enough to carry around regularly for labels away from your desk, at the storage area, behind the servers to label cables, etc.The touch screen worked alright for me, but is probably more of a gimmick than a necessity. The labels themselves are clear, and look professional.The Bad:The labels jam more often than I'd like, but the jams are simple to fix, just an annoyance (often the jammed label is still usable). We use labels at work for our parts bins. The labels came out clear and crisp.Overall, I was able to do useful work in the non-PC mode immediately and without going online to consult the instructions. I was able to make nice labels without consulting the instructions. It can store labels internally. I made about six labels. If you are not actively making labels, it will turn itself off within a minute or two. I like that it accepts 1" wide labels and the color touch screen is definitely a big plus when composing the label. It makes perfectly decent labels.
