I picked out my first label to put on the appropriate binder, applied it, and then realized I'd put the wrong label on the wrong folder. It's nice that they are removable, because I didn't have to waste the label tearing it back off. You can quickly put a label on each box and mark what it contains to help keep inventory organized and easy to find.I am pleased to find another great 3M product made in the USA. As with all the other 'printable' label products I've used, the ink smudges when I run off prints with my inkjet printer if I touch the ink within thirty seconds of it coming out. The entire label is sticky, but only slightly more so than regular Post-it notes. Like the other 3m label products I've tried, these are quite nice. -- and they are relatively easy to remove without completely destroying the label itself. And since it is a label, the entire item is sticky. Since they are removable I can change the label easily. This is the inexpensive, versatile label I have been waiting for. I also use these to label shelves (for paperwork) and small boxes for organizing random items. I tried them out - pressed a label on and not only did it stick very securely but I peeled it off the jar and moved it to another location to see if it would remain in place. Obviously, repositioning a crooked label is no big deal. Not one label wasted.Post-It is one of those brands which are always copied unsuccessfully by other companies, so much so that we call the knock-offs by their name. I have a label printer as well but I think that's going to become redundant.

What makes these different then every other label out there is the glue they use.

This label has good adhesive, which is strong enough to stick but easy to remove.

This does not work well when the label is stuck on paper, but on surfaces such as metal and plastic, it's great.I downloaded the template file (3M Template 2700-P.doc) for this label from 3M and first tried to test print on plain paper.
