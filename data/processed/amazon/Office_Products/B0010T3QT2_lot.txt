If you send a lot of mail where it is important that nobody reads it but the addressee, then you are probably in a business that can get a better volume price on the above envelopes or something similar. If you have a lot of mailing to do, these are wonderful. I recommend especially for those who are doing a lot of mailing. I really don't think there's a whole lot you can say about a white #10 envelope is there? I send a lot of checks through the mail so these have been a godsend (no pun intended). I use a lot of envelopes in my business to mail documents, bills, and letters through the mail and this "Reveal-N-Seal" technology is by far the coolest thing ever invented with envelopes. I have been doing a lot of patent searching lately, so I immediately looked up the patent. I like these a lot. Not a whole lot of exciting things to write - these envelopes are grea because they are easy to seal with a self sticking coating.

There's not a lot you can say about white #10 envelopes, however I did like this product.Sealing the envelope flap is simple and the bond is strong.

I send out a lot of mail---so these nifty envelopes were something I wanted to try out.They are made with a very nice weight to them.You cannot see thru them --another thing I loved ---since I have a couple of accounts that I still send checks in the mail to pay for them.

Well, there's not a lot to be said about envelopes, but I will say that these are better than the self-adhesive ones.
