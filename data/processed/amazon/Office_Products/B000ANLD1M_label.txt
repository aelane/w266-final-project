It does cover the label under it thoroughly, and you cannot read through it. Overall a nice label product but you might as well buy the more widely available full-sheet labels. We carefully and painstakingly peeled off the Amazon label, then taped the new label down using shipping tape. I then placed the label into my printer (in my case it was face down - yours may be different) and printed the first label. I peeled the label off to use, then turned the paper around (with the other end at the top) and ... presto, printed the second label.At one point, I made a mistake and cut the label in half before it was printed. Not wanting to lose even a single label, I inserted the half-page into my printer. And before, that meant printing out the label on regular paper, cutting it out and taping it to boxes and envelopes. (The label will add a fifth of an ounce to your shipping weight.) Avery is the only label brand I will use! You just select the label in your printer settings, put the blank labels into the printer, and print your labels. Once your label is securely placed on the box, there is no bleed through of the information from underneath. Since this label is grey on the backside (but not black in the core), what Avery calls "TrueBlock Technology" - it covers the original label and original bar code stuff that messes up the UPS/other delivery service readers.The only funny thing I can say about these labels is that the template number is not on the label sheet. I have not had a single label jam in the printer. Finally, they seem to resist wrinkling while being applied to boxes better that any other label I have used.These labels though come in handy in a number of different cases. When I first used an Avery label, I had no idea that they were specifically designed to block out the previous label, so I blacked it out as usual with a marker and put the Avery label over it. Previously I have used Avery's 5327, which is a shipping label on top and a white sheet of paper on the bottom for receipt. To prevent the second label on the sheet from being wasted as a receipt, here's how you can change the settings on the various shipper sites:UPS: In the Complete Shipment page of UPS Internet Shipping, make sure that the receipt checkbox is unchecked.US Postal Service: Download the USPS Shipping Assistant for the option to print without the receipt (the web based checkout only has the option to either print with a receipt or to print 2-up labels).Paypal: Go to Profile / More Options / Selling Preferences / Shipping Preferences / Printer / Edit Printer Settings / Uncheck "Print Receipt" checkbox / Save.Fedex: Go to Page Setup and clear any of the info in the Header and Footer and play with the margin settings and test with a blank sheet of paper until only the extra information disappears, then print on the real label. I don't know if it's just this label or the entire line, & I don't know when they made the change; but they've gone to a much thinner backing then I remember. I tried spraying a printed label with water an hour after printing with my HP Scanjet printer, and the ink did not bleed or smear.The printing process for Click N Ship is dead simple, but you do need to make sure to choose "print label only" or else the second label on the sheet will get your confirmation info printed on it. As for the label quality, it is excellent. It makes me sad when I end up wasting a perfectly good label when it ends up printing the receipt instead due to the wrong setting or whatnot. I use every label preciously. Moreover, for this particular label, it has a special "TrueBlock Technology", which has a gray coating on the back of the label, so you have a peace of mind when putting this label over an old address, without the need to cross it out or rip it off yourself. The only real negative is you still need to trim the label because it runs across the whole paper.Yes you are paying for the convenience but it the worth the cost not having to tape the paper label to the boxI would recommend to product to friends and family Thus you are wasting one label per shipment. However, the "TrueBlock" really works, you can not see thru the label. As with any label, creativity is endless - however the size makes it great for a variety of uses such as1. The new label completely covered it! This label is compatible with USPS Priority Mail and Express Mail. I would hate to ruin another label. The label peels off leaving the back in tack so you can easily print one label and then later run it through the opposite way to print the other even after pulling one off, no problems. If you look at one of these next to a 3m label you can instantly see the difference. Perfect "label-size" self-adhesive label blanks for ink-jet printers. You can put this label over an old one and nothing at all shows through.The labels dont smear or smudge and I haven't had one jam in the printer yet.I took off one star because I wish the adhesive was a little stronger.
