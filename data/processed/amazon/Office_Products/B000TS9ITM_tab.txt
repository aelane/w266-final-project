The built in tab is nice, but what impresses me the most is how sturdy these are. Not having to deal with those attached plastic tab holders is a big improvement. I'll stick with the plastic tab variety for now. I really like that you can write on the tab. I also like that the write-on tab where you can label the folder is a large size (good for the name of the folder standing out). If you plan to reuse these, however, you'll have to cover over the tab with one of those stick-on file folder labels. The tab is a actually a thick write-on area. Here, just write on the tab. The built-in tab is a time saver but on the down side, there are no slots to attach tabs so a sticker would be required to relabel the folder. Having the tab as an integral part of the folder is really useful - saves having to find the plastic tab and paper insert - plus will avoid the inevitable breaking of the plastic with use - only downside is color - moss aka bathroom wall green The middle tab is folded over and glued about 1" with about " of a tab (5" long) to write on or to attach a sticky label. If you decide to write over your tab label, simply use a stick on label. They have a built in tab for labeling/organizing in 3 set positions. You can write directly on the tab or stick on a label but if you want to reuse the folder for something else later on, you're going to have to stick another label on top of that to change the name. Having a built-in tab on each hanging file has helped me organize easier and more quickly. The tab top is extra sturdy because it is made of folder board folded over on itself and glued to the metal hanger.These are quality folders.

The permanent tab won't break or come off.

They have a nice big tab which can display the Brother printed labels I use for all of my files.

However I couldn't reposition the tab making it of limited use in a complex filing structure.
