Box is worth keeping to keep laminator dust free, has carry handle.Laminator has place in base to wrap cord up. I still need a larger laminator but this one works for any standard paper size , it says up to 9 inches wide and they make pouches 14 inches long. I like it enough to look at buying a larger laminator from this company. As far as laminator's go this one's pretty spendy. I love this laminator.

To compare an old classic laminator with a cutting edge version of a new classic laminator, let me state that I have the now defunct Cool Laminator by Brother. The Brother laminator doesn't require pouches; the cartridge has many feet of laminate built in (they even had a magnetic laminate cartridge). I've never owned a laminator so I don't have another one to compare with this one but I can tell you this one works great! The laminator look very attractive stored on a shelf with it's cord wrapped underneath and the feeder tray stored.

This laminator has a built in handle, power cord spool to keep it wrapped up when not in use, and the box it come in is easily reusable to store the unit (also with a built in handle).

Plug the laminator in, extend the input tray, power it on, wait until the green ready light is one, select either 3mm or 5mm pouch thickness... and insert your pouch  closed end first.
