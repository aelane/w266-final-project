It would be an ideal binder for a college student who wants to use one binder to keep track of all materials for more than one subject. This binder is more than what a typical user would need for one subject. The binder will do a very good job of protecting your documents. I can also use the binder part for taking minutes of our meeting. The binder holds a full size notebook which I can use while in the binder.The handle is tight to the hand, just enough room to pick up without much gap. This binder is lightweight and perfect for my minimalist needs as a business person.I recommend it for business, school, or for someone who needs more than a binder to store and transport things. This will be very handy with its large 2&#34; binder capacity, separate file/paper dividers, and mesh pouch. The binder does not need to be a zippered binder, but my children like the security of the zipper as it keeps all of their papers contained even if they drop it between classes. The three ring binder stores plenty of pages, but I can also stow odds and ends of loose pages in the six pocket folder-style compartment that is accessed either from the outside or internally. This large, soft-sided binder has lots of storage and organization built in. This is a great binder for my middle schooler. Five Star Zipper Binder Plus.I really like this binder. It not only is a 2&#34; zippered binder but also has 6 folders in the front zippered compartment that can be accessed from th  outside via a desperate zipper on the inside when th  main zipper is opened. The binder part inside the case is also well made. It's not the best binder we've had but it's still pretty good. This binder doesn't feel like it will last long, as it is constructed in a very flimsy manner. This binder was designed with a paper world in mind: the three-ring binder, the file folders, the  zipper pocket for pencils and post-its and rulers. This is a very useful large (12x14) zippered binder, which for adults is a great alternative to a briefcase for less formal settings. Although the binder does appear durable, a small rip in the fabric can quickly do damage to its appearance.

It is very unusual for me to give a binder a 5-star rating, for in most cases I find  weaknesses in the construction that will eventually lead to poor retention of papers and files and/or tearing at the folds.

Looking at it, one sees a standard 3-ring binder with a zipper closure, but this binder is far more than that.

I can't say I've ever had a binder so complete, convenient and sturdy.
