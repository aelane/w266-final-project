This thing looks like something from the space program. This thing set up in about 5 minutes. I find it kinda ugly, but that a subjective thing. The only thing I don't care for is the separate color ink tanks, I prefer the one cartridge for color, but that isn't a deal breaker, just an observation. The only thing that feels a bit flimsy is the main paper cassette, everything else feels like a well-built and expensive machine.Print quality is very good. Maybe it's a Windows 8 thing? Not to mention this thing guzzles ink. The one thing I miss from my older Canon is the lack of a back-feed capability for quick printing of envelopes or other paper formats.

Personally, my favorite thing about this is the fact that it won't stop dead in the middle of a print job if one ink tank goes dry.

It looks great since it's got that Samsung-like &#34;Touch-Of-Color&#34; thing going on.

This thing prints FAST!
