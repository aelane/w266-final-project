Growing up, we used masking tape for all sorts of things. It was our all around go-to tape, probably because it was fairly inexpensive and easily torn by hand. This tape is wider (1.5" versus 1") and more sturdy. I've pulled pretty hard on it and can't get it to break.This tape also beats out the painters tape that I've been using for general purpose use in that it adheres better. This tape does come off easily, too, but it holds better in my experience than the blue tape that I've bought. The cream-colored tape is thick and stable in securing its targets, and I have been satisfied with its performance. This tape is wide enough and strong enough for that use as well. I never much thought about whether premium tape is a thing that exists, but I guess it does!I've found this to be very nice overall. It's tape. This is a thick tape. When I first opened the tape I thought this isn't too different from my regular masking tape that I've used for years. This is the tape that I will reach for when working on a project that requires masking. This tape is what I expect when I use masking tape. I use this tape to mask off small auto parts on an old Chevy pickup before painting. Masking tape that works just as it should. It is really great tape that you do not even need scissors to cut, you can just pull and tear with your fingers when using.I like that it is the extra wide role which is about an inch and a half wide , and it is a long thick role of about 60 yards. Simply the best tape on the market. I've used cheaper masking tape before (never used anything more expensive...)  But, this masking tape works great. This tape is same color as regular masking tape but it is thicker and more substantial. After using the tape to mask off a cabinet I was painting, the next day I easily removed the tape, with clean lines remaining.I do like the extra width of the tape, some others are too skinny and too thin. It is a &#34;super&#34; masking tape - not the inexpensive type we used to use before the advent of the blue tapes.I don't recommend it for inside use - there are less expensive options that will work well for those situations. Masking tape is masking tape. This tape is far superior to blue painters tape for masking off an unpainted area. Albeit an expensive tape for the task, in a pinch the tape can also be used to remove pet fur from a variety of surfaces those with furballs will know precisely what I mean! The tape / glue does have a funky odor, even after a few weeks. This is great masking tape, I'll give it that. This tape is EXPENSIVE at $13.35 (as of 12/31/13) for a roll, I've had really good luck with the blue painters tape in the past and frankly there isn't enough difference for me to justify this premium in cost. I was naive and did not realize that masking tape has a shelf life of a year before it deteriorates and performs less well, and must note that I received a very fresh roll of tape to use. well i got this tape and i guess i was bamboozeled by the fact it was sticky.. and looked and smelled like masking tape.its def a high performer! The tape doesn't tear when you don't want it to, it sticks where you do want it to, and it stays until you remove it. I'm sorry, I just can't say &#34;I LOVE it!&#34; about masking tape, but I do like using it. I have always used Scotch masking tape for previous paint jobs in my home as I have less problems and better performance than any other paint related tape. I do think that Frog tape does the best lines on really uneven surfaces like orange peal texture on walls. But this Scotch tape will withstand some temperature curing process &#8211; I just have no need for that application. I have always hated how masking tape didn't stick well to anything other than a flat cardboard box. This tape seems to stick to things very well. Overall, it performs well for masking tape. The tape did not let the paint bleed through like most. I also used this tape for keep the vinyl in tack in my kitchen cabinets and draws as well. This tape is thicker than most masking tape I have used for projects, making it easier to remove (not tearing as you remove). This is standard masking tape. The tape itself is sturdy but easy to rip. I've painted and repainted.What I found I hate is tape that's hard to tear (scissors? And tape that splits and shreds (yuckadoo).I had no problems with this Scotch High Performance tape. And the tape cuts exactly as you'd want it to.Very good tape. Scotch tape is the best, in my experience. The tape did a great job adhering to every possible surface (wood, glass, plaster on lath...). Great tape for multi-purpose use. Anyway it's great for regular tape purposes but pretty pricey as others have observed. I got this tape because I needed masking tape and not scotch tape. I used this making tape to tape off the trim in a hallway so that I could paint. This is a strong, thick, easy to tear, masking tape that sticks where it is taped but is easy to remove as well. The tape was easy to remove and did not damage the moldings. Additionally the tape held the painter&#8217;s tarps in place. The tape itself is made of high quality and it was easy to tear. It is easy to take off, making this a great tape all in all. This tape goes on easily, makes clean and straight paint lines, and most importantly, it comes off easily. The Scotch High Performance Masking tape is a rather high priced masking tape that would not likely be used for every day needs. I was excited when I found that this tape was designed to be used in paint-bake operations up to temperatures of 250 degrees. When I removed the tape it still looked brand new: no scorch marks, no curling, and even after 45 minutes at 275 degrees the tape still had some of its stickiness.So if you need a masking tape that can withstand temperatures up to 250 degrees, this is the tape for you. I used this tape to mask on a particle board, and it help OK. I advise against using this tape to mask over freshly painted surfaces or to mask over ANY flat paint no matter how long it has dried.

I knew when I ordered this tape that it would do the job.

I use masking tape for paint projects, mostly.

This tape holds strong and tight and worked wonderfully when painted over.
