This is a truly professional printer that has nearly the same footprint as cheaper versions. The printer this replaced was always clogging up and needing a head cleaning. Setting it in the printer utility had no effect. The printer was intuitively easy to set up wirelessly. This printer draws a lot of electricity and causes the lights to flicker and the UPS to cycle so I have to leave it powered off when it's not being used. The printer copier scanner works just as well as others. It is an OK printer copier wireless machine, but not the one I prefer. First, let me point out that this printer is BIG - not quite the stand-on-the-floor version you find in a large busy office, but BIG. Also, while this is a wireless printer and does contain the right technology to make it work wirelessly with a Mac, it is rather heavy - FAR over the limit of what I am allowed to lift - so I simply connected it to the computer with a USB cable.While the machine does do rapid printing and produces very clear photo prints, I found the touchscreen, which unlike the Epson All-In-One I've been using, features fine black text on an unlit gray background, almost impossible to read and had to resort to my stronger pair of reading glasses. I just turned the printer on and let it find my network, then I let the software installed on my PC find the printer (via wireless), and I was done. This printer comes with "starter" toner cartridges for fewer page prints (approx 1000 black, 700 color) out of the box. I've never owned a printer in this price/feature range or that was a laser printer, so the SL-C1860FW represents a noticeable improvement in performance and features from the Brother and Epson printers (both $100-$150 range) I'm replacing.Setup is really easy and can be done entirely wirelessly. I think this is a very good printer. The printer comes with an attached USB cable that tech support explained must be connected to the printer when setting it up.I have a wireless router. Luckily the printer was near my computer so it was easy to attache the USB cable. I had placed the printer on the other side of the room it would have been hard to move it over to my computer to setup the wireless features. I have used the printer, scanner and fax features and they are easy to use. The printer makes a bit more noise when printing than I expected but it is no overly loud. It seems strange that a wireless printer needs to be connected to a computer during setup-it kind of defeats part of the purpose of having a wireless printer. My printer is near my computer so I could easily connect eh USB cable. If my printer was in another room I would have been annoyed. What I love about this printer is the easy access to printing.
