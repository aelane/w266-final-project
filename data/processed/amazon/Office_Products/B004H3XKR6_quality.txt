Build quality is fairly good, however the paper trays and hinges for the flatbed scanner cover seem less than robust. Under a magnifier it does resemble laser quality on the text. last forever the quality of the printing is fantastic and it's incredibly simple that anyone in the house can use it no problem. The quality is identical [even in color] to what I was copying. If however, you print high quality pictures, I can't say that this is that much faster than my Canon, maybe just a bit, but it is certainly better quality.Scanner:  I can't say that the scanner is anything special here, it's like anything else. The quality is top notch at the highest settings, but, as with any scanner, you might as well brew a pot of coffee while you get that high quality image saved to a hard drive that can hopefully sustain it (especially if you've got lots of images to scan); I see no reason to scan at the highest quality setting for most every-day page-text; and in this scenario it's lightning fast. If it doesn't run out and I want better quality paper, I'll choose tray 2 on the print screen. Not so fast in high quality mode, but that is not a commonly used mode.The text printing on this Epson truly looks like a laser printer. The quality of photo prints is not as good as with my Canon single-function photo printer but that is to be expected.It offers two sided printing.....I mean, instantaneous two-sided printing to have double sided page come right out, instead of waiting for the odd page to print and then waiting for the even page to print.A neat function on the touch screen panel to print out various ruled papers....only from tray #1 though. The scan quality is not as good as my Canon single-function scanner, but again, that's also to be expected. The quality of the prints looks ok to me when printing documents, the quality of photo prints is definitely not as good as with my photo printer but that is to be expected. Print quality is what you should expect in this price range. However, I you need to print high quality color photos, then you should look elsewhere. I have to say, if you are going to buy a good quality printer for your home or office. I can honestly say that this is a high quality Printer. Print quality is great, and photo's come out very nice too. At the highest quality, a 8 1/2 x 11 photo takes about 1 minute and 20 seconds.-Scan SpeedsScanning at 300 dpi (wirelessly) takes 11 seconds (the scan can be initiated from the scanner or the PC). Scan quality is superb. It delivers high quality prints/scans at very, very impressive speeds. It looks pretty good, but I am spoiled by the quality of my HP laser jet printers. Full COLOR and Wireless INKJET - the quality is great, the black and full color printing are all quite fast, and best of all, this printer is wireless (so no long, annoying USB cables to deal with). Overall I think this is a great high quality printer.Notes:- Wireless is so nice. Laser quality black text and high quality and  high contrast photo/graphics6. The high quality level (for photos) looked nice (paper makes a big difference) but was pretty slow.Scanner:The quality of the scanned image was good. *** The quality of the print is equal (if not better than) what you pay to have printed at Kinko's, etc. The quality of this item is top of the line. It prints very quickly with excellent quality. Scanning is very quick and also very good quality. I rarely need to print high quality sheets, so this isn't an issue for me.
