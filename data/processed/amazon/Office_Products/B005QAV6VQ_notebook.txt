Hard to get excited about a notebook. This is a cool little notebook though!It is your average sized notebook (11&#8221; tall, 10&#8221; wide, and just over 1.1&#8221; thick), and comes with 200 college-ruled sheets (three hole punch and perforated). This gives the notebook a unique look, keeps the metal from getting banged up, and allows the notebook to be a little smaller than the same capacity hard-style binder. I'd give the notebook 3.5 stars if I could....this notebook is okay, but I don't think that I would use one again.Things I DO like: as a 5-subject notebook, it has plenty of writing room. All in all an excellent notebook I love this notebook. I really like this notebook. This notebook goes far beyond the usual to impress the most demanded. This is a big heavy notebook. This notebook might actually have a chance to make it. I certainly wouldn't want to throw away this usefull a notebook. When Mead named this notebook the Five Star Advanced Notebook, they gave it an honest name. I selected this notebook for my wife who is always looking for good notebooks and pads to keep things organized around the house. If this is a notebook where the intention is to keep it for a long time and retain the contents for later use, that&#8217;s one thing, but if it&#8217;s just for working through a couple of classes with no intention of revisiting the material later it seems a bit pricey.My wife has complained about the thinness of the actual sheets. Previously I reviewed a different Mead notebook and I was pretty enthusiastic about it. On the other Mead notebook I noted that I planned to glue-on tabs so that the kids could tell which subject was where. they are inside the notebook. I think this is a notebook that is going to hold up better than others, and it's a notebook which has some unique and useful features. This is a good notebook choice for high school or college students. The notebook has five sections with plastic divider pages that can be used to store papers or homework. And you thought a notebook was a notebook. If you plan to actually use this notebook to write in at school a pen could prove to be useful.4. However, I have to say that this notebook is all that and then some. This is a sturdy five-subject notebook, ideal for school use. The notebook comes with five sections and contains 200 sheets that have been pre-punched (3-hole). The notebook also contains a high quality plastic front and back which will ensure it won't fall apart easily during the school year. Overall, this is an excellent notebook and my only reservation here is the rather steep price.T
