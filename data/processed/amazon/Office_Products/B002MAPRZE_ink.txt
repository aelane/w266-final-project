Despite the 'lower' ink prices I like HP's cartridges... in fact I just replaced an HP Black one that had lasted 3 years.----Drawbacks:1. The ink does tend to run out fairly quickly.4. The ink is stored in felt material which is why you can not measure the volume of ink since most of the volume is felt. As you get into 8 and 12 ink wide gamut printers from HP, they add extra colors that are not easily mixed with CMYK like orange and purple are added to the ink tanks to handle output with orange tinted or deep purple tinted areas. HP and Kodak both add a photo black as well as a non-photo black ink. Also, the ink may be cheep, but it doesn't last very long.PROS:Price - printer is pretty cheep, but ink may not beWifi connectionSize - reasonable footprintSpeed - starts printing right away (doesn't take forever buzzing and clicking before printing)Drivers and software - not overbearing and work as intended on my XP and Win 7 machinesCONS:Lacks a dedicated photo paper tray - requires you to remove the 8.5 x 11 paper to print on photoHas a fairly small paper tray - about 100 sheets of 8.5 x 11 paperRequires you have a workable color ink in place to print in black and whiteHaving one color ink cartridge means you have to replace the whole thing when only yellow is emptyCartridges are low capacity (at least the included cartridges were - but they were not labeled "starter" or anything like that) - I got a few dozen pages of black and white text before it started fading - I got about ten 4x6 color photos before it started fading.Photo printing quality is not as good as myHP Photosmart Premium Fax All-in-One Inkjet Printer (CC335A#ABA)The copy function seems to need a computer to be involved - although it works in the backgroundAll in all, I give this a luke warm review. But it's the same ink, and same company, so I was really excited to get this since it's been such a long time coming. And the ink is cheap compared to HP. The inexpensive ink cartridges are a big added plus. The ink heads are not part of the cartridges but I like the fact that the ink heads are in their own piece that installs in the printer. I've wasted so much ink and had so many issues that it's simply impossible to begin on what is wrong with this system. I've used Kodak ink, compatible ink and swapped them back and forth to no avail. It is also reasonably priced and the ink cartridges are a lot cheaper compared to other brand. Kodak ink cartridge is relatively inexpensive3.
