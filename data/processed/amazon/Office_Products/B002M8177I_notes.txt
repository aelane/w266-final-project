Obviously if you are leaving notes in a reference book, then it doesn't make sense to erase them :)As to how useful these can be, this really depends on your "workflow", or I should say, "readflow". If you hate leaving notes in books with a pen or highlighter, and you don't mark every single page in a book, this can be a reasonable option. I love sticky notes, and the Avery Note Tabs may end up being one of my favorite types. While these are good for making notes, some pens seem to have problems writing on these. Since my notes here pertain to all of these, my reviews of the individual products are largely the same. I tend to make notes regarding how a recipe turned out and if I want to make any changes the next time I try that same recipe. This is good for when you need to take several notes on a page, and it could work as a divider in a notebook, too. I used these to make notes in my recipe books and they worked great. Often, I'd write notes in the margins of the textbooks, referring back to the text itself so that: a) I wouldn't have to copy the quoted text that I was referring to into my notes, and b) it was easy to express my thoughts and ideas right on the page so that when my professor called on me, I could refer immediately to my thoughts without shifting through my papers.The Avery NoteTabs are great because there's only so much space in the page margins and you can use as many overlapping notetabs as necessary. I liked being able to see through them, write notes on them, tear off the notes in sections as I need them, and the tab is nice too. I used these to take notes in my college books. They make seperating my notes a whole lot easier than leaving tons of blank pages or having to keep all kinds of 5-subject notebooks handy. I now use them for sticky notes on documents and papers. Perfect for making temporary/removable notes in books or various other documents. Being able to see through the notes is invaluable.
