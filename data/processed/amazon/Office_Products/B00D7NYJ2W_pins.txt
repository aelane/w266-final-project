These are great when you want pins you can really get a hold of. These large pins are such neat idea! These are perfect if you are looking for pins that are just a little decorative. These pins are so much easier to work with than their smaller standard sized cousins. These pins put the "fun" in "function". These pins might be too big and pricey for some tasks, but they are awesome (for thumbtacks) when it comes to pushing into tough materials. These are nice, big pins that add a little decor to my bulletin board. The pins themselves are VERY sturdy and the colour variety &#8211; while not too important to me &#8211; has a nice selection to choose from. I like that they are bigger than most push pins and come in a variety of colors. These little pins are great - as you can see from the picture, the colors are a little more bright and vibrant than you typically get - the little bit of translucence makes them stand out. I've never really used any pins that are different from the standard ones. The pins themselves are  inch long. I usually buy push pins at the dollar store, so these are actually 100% more expensive than the cheaper ones I usually use (as they are currently priced at just under $2). However, I sometimes use push pins in harder surfaces and they are much better for less yielding surfaces.The pin portion (metallic projection) is also thicker than cheap push pins and is less likely to snap off or bend under increased pressure. The pins are long and hold well in cork or drywall.
