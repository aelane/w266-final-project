(other than the legally required monthly taxes, which run about $3 a month for me) We went with the basic and with taxes are still well under 10 a month, and that includes long distance. Even with the taxes how can you beat the price and still get the features? When I installed it, I was informed that I was liable for applicable taxes. My taxes of about $3.50 per month are automatically debited to my credit card, and my friends cannot believe how low my phone bill is. Yes, just the taxes. All that I am billed is for the required taxes amounting to $5 in this area since I've paid the $99.99 in advance for the year. My taxes and fees ended up to be $4/mo.

I recently converted from Vonage to Ooma Telo because Vonage was costing me $33/month after taxes and everything.

You can opt for free Ooma, where you only pay monthly taxes - incredible deal compared to other VoIP's.

But we are still, after paying taxes, saving about thirty dollars a month.
