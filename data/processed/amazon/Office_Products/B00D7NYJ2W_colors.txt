I also like the colors. I love the colors and the big size of these push pins - the big size is great for easier handling and they're very sturdy. The colors are very bright but still have a transparent style to them. They are not only available in great colors but have large heads that are easy to manage.You can tell this company has listened to concerns that some might have about products dealing with sharp ends because they have included a suggest age use of 8+ to let you know if this is something that might be advisable for children to take to school with them or even use around the home.However you choose to use them, I think you would agree that this product Quartet will be a welcomed edition to either home or work. Multiple colors, including clear, red. The colors are fun and vibrant as well. They are translucent, come in different colors and are larger than the usual pins. The bright colors of this particular set are gorgeous. Perfect pins, unless you don't like the colors and I do. They're translucent colors are bright and shiny, making my normal smaller solid color pushpins look dirty and boring in compassion. They are well made and very attractive in bright colors! The colors include clear, yellow, pink, purple, green, and blue.I prefer these big pins to the little ones that I have been using. The colors are bright and cheerful. The colors are a fresh change too. The colors are also nice and make boards a little less boring. The colors are bright and cheery and they really look nice on my cork board. I thought the bright colors were nice and they stood out well against the cork board. And the colors!A
