We packed ~30 different gifts and still have a few refills left. I was able to wrap about 20 gifts without stopping, without needing to break out a regular roll of tape. Wrapping gifts goes so much faster. That means that both she and I end up wrapping many gifts alone and without the help of an extra set of hands. They were great when I was wrapping gifts or just needed my hands free while working on a project. When wrapping gifts, it is a great convenience. great for wrapping gifts (duh!) They wrap so beautifully, it almost makes me consider buying gifts there instead of Amazon.

it's absolutely perfect and made wrapping gifts not only faster but easier- no more playing twister while holding a piece of paper just so and rooting around for the roll of tape.

I wrapped almost all my gifts to give out so far and still have some left.
