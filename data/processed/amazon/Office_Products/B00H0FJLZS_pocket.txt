The clear pocket at the bottom can be utilized in a pinch. You can pull a certain pocket and take to your desk and just pop it back inside when no longer needed. There is a pocket on the front that is handy for loose papers or to show a calendar sheet (as shown on the package). I love the clear pocket at the bottom, which is perfect for hall passes. Each pocket can hold a file folder. Each pocket is removable but I have just been putting file folders in each pocket.The description says each pocket can hold 25 sheets which seems reasonable. There is also a clear pocket on the bottom that can hold some sheets but not 25.I have used this for a month and it has worked well. Assuming each pocket is full, at 25 pages each, that's 175 pages.

One pocket for unpaid bills, one for unfiled medical records, one for tax stuff, etc.
