If you're looking for a reliable, well built, well designed machine, you'll be hard pressed to find a better one. I tried out this binding machine on a small, 15 page document with regular white copy paper just to see how it would do. If you can say any machine kicks, this thermal binder does. I was excited to receive this machine, primarily for its advantages.First, as with anything, if you actually use the machine you need to read the directions carefully. This machine claims it will bind up to 600 sheets, but I feel any document that heavy would be unstable and would recommend splitting it up.This binder does not come with any covers. This is a perfect machine if you want to have great looking presentation documents and I'd highly recommend it. All's I need to do now is bind them in this machine, and get it over with. The machine automatically detects the size of binding you're doing, and gets nice and hot fairly quickly. First off, I never thought I'd say this for a machine such as this, but it is a really nice looking, sleek design.But that's beside the point.Functionality-wise this is a really great machine for the most part; with a few minor glitches.Binding Thicknesses:The minimum thickness you can put in is 1/4 of an inch, which is 60 pages and takes 60 seconds to bind. Once I accounted for this and pressed OK, the machine took about one minute to bind everything. The machine is easy to use, it heats up quite quickly, and it binds the materials quickly, too. This machine works well as advertised with no issues. The machine has a small footprint and actually looks nice sitting around the office. Although the machine is likely too small for a large business and too expensive for many individuals, it is a great fit for a small business. It worked just fine.The machine is light, so it's easy to pack up and store when not in use. That allows the machine to sit flush on a shelf without a cord bulge.I also liked how the heating element is well inside the machine, guarded with a part you must pull back. When I was using it, I felt all around and under the machine. So this machine is relatively safe to use around children. After using this machine for a few time with varied thickness papers from 1/4" to 1", I can say that it works exactly as described.You need to follow the process exactly as described in their user manual and the binding works without any hassle. First let me start off to say this machine is very simple to put together and use so even if you are not very electronic saavy I think this machine will work for you. This machine is good for small binding project. I am very impressed with this machine. The machine is designed to apply controlled heat to the stripes, thus activating them and melting the glue into the paper edges. The machine was quick to heat, the pages fit easily in the folder, and the binding process itself couldn't have been easier. This great little machine does an excellent job on binding your presentations/manuals/reports/etc. This is easily a 5-star machine that works wonderfully, and I recommend it highly, but you have to be aware that if you bind with some regularity you'll end up having to spend a lot more than just the cost of the machine.
