I see this cup lasting and for its reasonable price it seems worth it. This is about as basic as a magnetic cup holder can get. If you fill the cup with pens it will not stay up. I tried the cup holder on my fridge and a metal white board. The cup with 6 dry erase markers didn't slide down the white board given it's weight, which is good. I knocked the cup off one time and it fell onto a carpeted office floor. Since the cup is such a hard plastic with no give in it, if it falls a good distance onto a hard floor, it might actually crack or shatter.Overall, for the price, though, this thing isn't bad. The magnetic cup looks great, looks much better than the photo -- well-designed. You can load up the cup with up to 21 sharpies and it holds them firmly. The cup itself is sturdy, not thin and cheaply made, and it holds a nice amount of pens/pencils/markers. This is a magnetic cup designed for holding your pens and markers and while primarily designed for a dry erase board, it will work on almost any magnetic surface, such as you fridge or a file cabinet. I have this pen cup on the refrigerator with dry erase markers in it. The cup itself is short and that makes it perfect to hold markers (not pens and pencils). I started using this cup to hold my dry erase markers and it has worked wonderfully. The cup is slightly less white than my board, but that's not a big deal to me at all.

The cup itself is rather large, but the magnet seems too weak to hold that many items.The cup is just cheap plastic and is far too shallow for proper organization.

The cup is rather hideous as well -- I really didn't expect it to be fabulous, but I didn't expect it to look so cheap.It holds pens/pencils as the name suggests, just not very neatly -- you are not going to get organization like the simulated product pictures.

The cup is disappointing in actual usage for the following reasons:1) The height of the cup is too short to securely hold pens, much less traditional pencils which are a little longer when they are new.
