However the magnet on the back of it is pretty strong and covers almost the whole back which would prevent the organizer from falling and breaking once attached to a magnetic source, such as a fridge. The magnet is very large so the mail holder stays firmly attached to the fridge even when the holder is full of mail. Having this as a magnet is BRILLIANT!I tend to keep WAY too many file folders on my desk and I'm always digging to find them, so this storage pouch has helped this challenge at least a little more easy to handle. Strong magnet holds well to refrigerator or file cabinet, but very pricey for the quality.This is one of those cases where I wish I could give a half star - my real rating would be 2 1/2 stars as it is fine for mail, but really not sized right for anything but US #10 size envelopes. The magnet was fine until I put a couple things in it. GREAT magnet, very strong and sturdy. This has a huge magnet that covers just about the whole back of it, so it can hold a lot of paper without a problem. The magnet is very strong, and the pouch is big enough to accommodate envelopes of all sizes you'd be likely to put there.Two issues:One, the pouch is rigid. The magnet really does a great job staying put. The magnet is strong and doesn't slip. The magnet backing is very strong and even though I put my sons book into it it did not slide down. It has a really strong magnet on the back of the organizer, which holds it securely in place when placed on the fridge door. The magnet is strong enough to hold it completely full of letter-sized paper (and we have stuffed it!) The magnet is strong, too...it's not going anywhere! The magnet is really, really strong. Also, the magnet is large and flat, and will only hold on a large flat surface like a fridge. The magnet on the back isn't skimpy and covers the entire back which helps ensure that even when the organizer is full it stays upright.
