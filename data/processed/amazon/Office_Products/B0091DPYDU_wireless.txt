Setup of wireless was also easy and I did test printing from my iPhone without a hitch. I have never been able to set up wireless for any printer I've ever had, but this printer set up perfectly in about 15 minutes or so. Setting up the wireless features is very easily (from opening the box to having this printer useable on 3 different computers in my house took just under 30 minutes). I set it up to print wireless from two different PC's. I can do that!The wireless hookup up was seamless. This is our first wireless printer. After using it, going wireless has been as much of a game-changer as when we got our first multifunction printer, several years ago. It is easy to set up and use for wireless printing for Windows 7 (32-bit, 64-bit),Windows Vista (32-bit, 64-bit), Windows XP SP3 (32-bit), Windows XP Professional x64 Edition and Mac OS X 10.5.x, 10.6.x, 10.7.x, 10.8.x7. I set it up using wireless from my desktop, my wife's laptop and the Airprint from my IPAD. I have mine connected wireless to my router so that it's accessible to all computers and wireless mobile devices in the house.I really like the automatic two-sided printing -- no more turning/flipping the paper over and reinserting into the paper tray to print the other side! This is the easiest wireless printer I have ever set up or used! I LOVE the wireless connectivity. Even if I got the wireless to work, the printer would not have worked because of the roller and a bad tray. I was surprised at how easy it was to set up (wireless) and how fast works. Setting up wireless was painless and I'm pretty sure this is the first printer installation that was this easy. Hooking it up as a wireless network printer was simple.Scanning is very slow compared to my old Canon. After giving up on the wireless network, there is no improvement in printer function. The wireless printing issue has never resolved itself. It will scan for your wireless network and after you select it, you will enter your password (if any). Once the wireless is set up, it will offer to print a confirmation page.
