These two magnetic marker pads are perfectly sized and magnetized to work well on our refrigerator, and everyone has adapted to using them very well. I have a black marker for the purple one.... As long as the marker is not near-empty, it is readable even on the purple. The included marker is purple, so on the purple board it is readable in good light from a close distance, but obviously not as readable as other colors.The included purple ink dry-erase marker is the usual flimsy basic marker included in products like this. Don't count on this being your main marker. However, get a nice black marker and you will be golden....well...dark enough to read.Overall 3 stars. The marker is not very good and you will want to get a different color for the darker board. The marker is purple, which is difficult to see on the purple board. The marker might as well be invisible ink.If you already have set of markers, you'll see the difference immediately. The marker comes with its own sponge wipe off end and is magnetized to cling to the refrigerator (or any steel surface.) The marker works well and it is nice that it has a magnet to stick to the fridge. I love that the marker is magnetic, it is so handy to stick on the fridge next to the boards so it is all ready to go. BUT, the marker is horrible! You could probably easily replace the marker if you want. The marker - I held out high hopes it would work better than most dry erase. The marker was writing light, and not showing up well by the second or third time used. The marker writes and wipes easily and doesn't leave ghost marks on the boards. The erasable marker is not very good. It could slide around.The marker included in the set was dark blue. The marker does have a magnet at the top. The marker is adequate, but the magnet fell off before I got it, and I think the purple ink is slightly too light for the purple board.The boards are little (5 inches by 8 inches), but they are a good size for making lists and leaving notes for people.They are magnetic, so they are super convenient to use on the refrigerator. The marker color almost matches the color of the writing surface, and simply cannot be read from across the room, rendering it useless. All of them except the black marker are too light to be read across the room, and all the magnets are weak and slide down the refrigerator door. I'll be getting a new marker soon to replace it (any dry erase marker will work), but other than that, I'm happy with these magnets. The marker is no good, too cheap, the tip is falling apart and it came half dry. This little one is the same marker that came with another set I I received, and the only reason they're ever used is because of that magnet on them... and they are difficult to read every time. The marker is kind of cheap but I use the eraser head because its so thin. The marker with the eraser on the end is also magnetic and sticks to the board, so it is close at hand when you need it.B
