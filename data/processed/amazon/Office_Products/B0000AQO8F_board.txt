Not an exceptional board. A very nice board and truly looks better-made, with a more handsome graphite finish.To me, no matter where your work desk is, even if it's at home in your living room, I personally think a bulletin board can be both attractive and functional. It is a heavy board and if it fell, it could deal someone quite a headache!The little plastic accessories that are supposed to be able to hold documents didn't work for me. This board is in my office den and looks very professional.The board comes with fantastic directions, very clear, very nice pictures. I got the board level on the first try using the directions. The board was packed well and there were no defects on inspection. The board works well, although as you push pins into the center of the board, you can feel a little bit of give as you push. If your looking for a board that will hold up, this is the one. The board seems high quality. This is a decent enough board (it looks nice, and works fine), but is not a commercial grade product.My experience:* Mounting it on the wall was mostly a smooth process. Personally, I would like to see a board that was half cork and half whiteboard, or perhaps reversible, but that isn't what is being sold here. If you are looking for a board that will blend into a contemporary office setting, this Quartet Cork Board would be a perfect choice. This board is a very nice size, not over large, but enough space to pin up whatever you need.
