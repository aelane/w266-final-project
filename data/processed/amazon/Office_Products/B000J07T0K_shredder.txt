Helps to keep your shredder working smoothly, especially if you are a heavy duty user. Use these to lube your shredder. Expensive shredder.... I bought a shredder that works like a tank and never complains. My shredder came with a bottle of lube (it's a specially prepared vegetable oil) and the instructions were to &#34;draw&#34; a big &#34;S&#34; on a sheet of paper, then shred it and then run the blades in reverse. Easy to clean/lubrucate your shredder. Depending on how gummed up or dry your shredder is you can hear the difference! That is unless you are seriously putting your shredder through some over-time, where the build up of heat could cause a problem. I use them in a small shredder so I have to cut them to fit. I decided to purchase it after buying a more expensive shredder on Amazon that I wanted to extend the life of. The shredder doesn't seem to need to work as hard and can shred more sheets at a time without struggling.This product makes it simple to do regular shredder maintenance and is a must-have. Universal makes some mighty good shredder lubricant sheets that, although they are indeed half the size as others noted, still really do the job well. It won't harm the shredder and it'll work much better. I have to admit that I had never oiled my shredder in the 2 years that I've had it. I use my shredder a lot so anything that will extend it's life is worth trying and  these  easy to use sheets seem to help.
