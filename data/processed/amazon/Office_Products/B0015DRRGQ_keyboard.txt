However, if you adjust the keyboard tray and your chair so that your arm and wrists are level with the keyboard, being able to slide the mouse platform over the number keypad then means that the mouse pad and its associated gel wrist rest is placed higher than the keyboard, resulting in a very unnatural feeling of reaching upward to move your mouse. So to optimally use this keyboard tray with its raised mouse platform, you should adjust the position of the keyboard tray relative to your chair and armrests so that the mouse platform's wrist rest is level with your hand and the keyboard is slightly lower than your forearms. As previously mentioned, to optimally use this keyboard tray and its articulated mouse platform, you really need to sit in an ergonomic chair that allows you adjust the chair's height/depth/angle and the chair's armrests should also be height-adjustable.If the raised mouse platform really bugs you even after adjusting your chair, one hidden "feature" that the assembly instructions do not mention about this keyboard tray is that you can turn the mouse platform's metal bracket upside down before inserting it into the side of the keyboard tray. The "Owner's Manual" for this keyboard tray really should have mentioned inverting the mouse platform bracket as an optional way to attach the mouse platform to the keyboard tray, especially if you rarely want to cover up the number keypad anyway because you frequently use the number keypad. If you use an ergonomic keyboard with a curved contour on this keyboard tray, you can purchase a3M Gel Wrist Rest for Ergonomic Split-Design Keyboards, Black Leatherette, Antimicrobial Product Protection (WR314LE)to fit your keyboard instead of using the supplied straight-shaped wrist pad.During use, this keyboard tray has a very admirable rigidity. Most sliding keyboard trays that are built into office desks have far more bounce to them.&#9658; Purchasing Considerations & Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:If you are deciding between the "Knob Adjust", "Lever Adjust", and "Easy Adjust" options that 3M offers, consider that 3M prices their "Knob Adjust" models as the less expensive option, their "Lever Adjust" models cost more by a slight price increase, and the "Easy Adjust" models increase the price another notch. Excellent keyboard tray, feels heavy duty and like it will last. So this keyboard tray can be a lifesaver. So if you are new to adjustable keyboard trays consider it an investment into your future because this is built to last a long time. I really like this keyboard tray. I replaced an old keyboard tray that came with my desk which was not as stable so it was a nice upgrade!There are 2 gel wrist pads... one for the keyboard and one for the mouse pad. The keyboard tray slides left to right, moves up and down, tilts, and the mousing surface can be either left or right of the keyboard.Absolutely awesome! I'm just a little tired of reaching higher from the keyboard for the mouse now. When I initially installed this keyboard tray on my hardwood desk, I was concerned that the weight of it would compromise the wood that my desk is crafted of in the installation (which wasn't terribly difficult to do, but did require a bit of effort on my part). My Microsoft keyboard fits on the keyboard section and my Microsoft mouse is comfortable on the platform.The best thing about this is that the tray is extremely sturdy and very comfortable. Unlike the Fellowes keyboard tray--which I regretted buying from day 1--the 3M stand is exceptionally sturdy, sized correctly for large keyboards, and incredibly easy to adjust.Let's face it, you get what you pay for.

The keyboard tray's sliding track is 17.75" long and 6.0" wide, and it uses six 0.75"-long screws being screwed around its perimeter to mount it to the underside of your desk.If the underside of your desk is metal, or has obstructions, wood beams, or metal support bars crossing its underside (e.g.

Before you buy this keyboard tray, sit at your desk where you would be mounting the keyboard tray, take a ruler and measure 4 inches from the bottom surface of the desk.

I may later want to transfer this keyboard tray to another desk, so to preserve this template sheet better, I also stuck clear cellophane tape over the hole markers on the template sheet before I drilled through the sheet so that the drill made two holes that were neat and free from tears in the template sheet.The keyboard tray comes with a variety of adhesive-backed Velcro-type fasteners  that are used to attach the keyboard wrist rest to the tray, attach the mouse wrist rest to the mouse platform, and affix the keyboard to the tray so that the keyboard also remains stationary on the tray.
