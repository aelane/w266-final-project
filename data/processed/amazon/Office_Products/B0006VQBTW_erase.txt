These are great dry erase markers for kids.We all know how much kids can abuse markers, so I wanted to get a cheap set that wouldn't be ruined right away, and would be easier for my little ones to use. Our dry erase board is next to our refrigerator. We usually put the dry erase markers on top of the fridge. These little dry erase markers are quite handy! We have had a dry erase board on our fridge for years, but unfortunately our board does not have a place to keep a marker. For those that like dry erase markers these are good. I was pretty disappointed with these dry erase markers. Meaning - they wouldn't stay attached to my dry erase board. These dry erase markers are adequate for small at home projects but if you are looking at longer term use as in a classroom, look elsewhere. How much can one really say about dry erase markers, except that it would be nice to have an orange, and the purple is really more bluish. We have a small dry erase board ostensibly for leaving messages, but which mostly gets used for drawing practice by our five and seven year old daughters, so it is nice that they have more colors to choose from. Dry erase markers are not expensive and we go through many at our house. Forever, when we grab a dry erase marker to make an entry the cap has been left off overnight or for even longer and it won't write because it is dried out. If using a smaller white dry erase board, probably totally fine. I normally keep my dry erase markers sitting in a cup facing up and they work fine so I question the quality of these but for under four dollars I can't really complain. I recently acquired a smaller dry erase calendar for my refrigerator door, but I didn't like the single black pen. These dry erase markers are pretty inexpensive, and have a cheap feel. These little dry erase markers are exactly what I needed for the message center/doodle space on our refrigerator. I love dry erase markers. We have a dry erase board in the kitchen which comes in useful for all sorts of reasons. I use these on my small 8 x 10 sized dry erase boards that I use for teaching anatomy, chemistry and physics. I use them on my black dry erase board and they show up really well. I usually use a large dry erase board eraser anyway, but for small/fine erasing, they do the job. First of all these are intended for smaller dry erase boards like the one designed for your cubicle or fridge. Every dry erase marker should have eraser caps! These dry erase markers work well. Now, I have to buy a new dry erase board! Since we use dry erase markers frequently at our learning center, I bought a pack of these to try something different. As my previous Quartet dry erase marker review, these are low odor markers, which is an important feature for me.
