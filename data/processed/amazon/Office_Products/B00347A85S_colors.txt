The colors are bright and saturated, the tip is soft enough to not make any sounds during use, yet firm enough to keep its shape.The eraser and the cleaner spray work very well. The colors are strong, y erase completely, and the cleaner removes any residue that might build up in time. The colors are bright, but not all that bold, really. I wish the colors were a little bolder or at least higher contrast, but that's truly personal opinion. They may be great colors for others. All the good colors you really need. It was difficult to find colors of dry erase markers. The colors are bold, the eraser is average but works fine, and the spray is great for those hard-to-clean doodles and messages. This colors in this set are good. The colors of the new Bic kit are also blue, red, green and black. Basic colors for writing on white board. The colors are pretty standard, but they show up strongly and brightly on a whiteboard. The colors were bold and sharp. I think these are great must-have basic colors.
