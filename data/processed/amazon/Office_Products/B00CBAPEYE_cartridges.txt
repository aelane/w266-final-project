Instead, the cheapest I could find for the same 10 Epson cartridges cost over $80. 6 new cartridges in XL will cost me $80. The cartridges are Epsons and not after market and each is individual thus you only have to replace the cartridge that is empty. It takes 4 small cartridges, 1 black and 3 colored.Warning don't print a test page, it uses way too much ink instead opt to open a word doc and print something from that.I will post back if anything changes The cartridges that come with the printer are 'starters' - they won't last a week. I replaced the cartridges twice since December ($59 each time), though I doubt I've printed a total of twenty pages, none in colour. While the cartridges appear to be priced competitively, that cost is deceptive, as they last half as long (if not less) than other printers that I have used (and am currently using; this includes an "Epson XP-800", which also has a pricey ink system in place). There are generic compatible and remanufactured cartridges available, but I can't attest to quality. I can see that there are high-capacity cartridges available, but I don't have any experience with them.My bottom line:  This is a very good, lower-end printer/scanner. OEM cartridges run about $13 for black and $8 for each of the colors. Four cartridges are required -- black, cyan, magenta, and yellow.
