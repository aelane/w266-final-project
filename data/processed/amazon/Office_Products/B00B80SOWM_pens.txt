They don't feel like the sturdiest pens on the market, but they're not cheaply made, either. The pens are about standard for gel pens. These pens are smooth as silk. These pens have a better tip than others I've used.The stand keeps your pens on display and lets you select color easily.Lovely and fun collection of colors. Chock full of pens in a rainbow of colors, the set looked like a lot of fun to play with.While the pen set itself is nice, the stand is a great extra feature. I love colored pens. Also, it can be hard to find colored pens that are just nice to write with.Luckily TEKwriterUSA has me covered with the Gelwriter Gel Pen Set!For starters, you get 44 colors of pens. My 9-year-old was all over these pens from the moment they were removed from the box, and it takes a mighty effort for me to pry them from her surprisingly strong little hands. I've used these pens in the past and I loved the way they wrote and the vivid colors. I just use these pens for writing and doodling...and I've been pleased with them so far. With so many pens, I could literally grade each student's work in a different color and never have to repeat colors within a class! The pens are of good quality. A few of the pens took awhile to achieve a consistent flow (sometimes the ink got really thin, and then got thicker after scribbling circles to get the flow started again). However, I just attribute that to the pens being new. The pens themselves are comfortable to hold and have a nice grip. The pens came separately in a plastic bag so it was my pleasure to get to sort the pens into color groups. When I unpacked these pens and started setting them into the stand, I immediately had the attention of my children (ages 7 to 16). Great pens, really good for drawing and general use. These pens are awesome. I was skeptical at first to see that the pens are to be stored vertically with the tips up, since the gel would draw back from the tips, right? I am very pleased with the pens. I did wonder about storing the pens upside down: would gravity pull the ink away from the pen? All 44 of these pens have been well-tested by both adults and kids as young as seven, and they have been a hit all around. I actually find myself using these more then my more expensive pens since they are easier to see and grab (my others are in a small drawer due to the claim they need to be stored laying down, I might test that theory now though since these work perfectly kept upright). The pens write well. I absolutely love colored pens and markers, and this TEKwriterUSA GEL PEN set offers an impressive 44 pens for under $20. The pens all write smoothly - the tip sizes vary from 0.7mm to 1.0mm, meaning that some of the pens are finer than others (the pens are not labeled with either a color name, number, or tip size, so you'll need to try them out to find the ones you like best). These pens are great. There are only three pens whose ink I can hardly see when I write on white paper and they are the two yellow pens and the very light orange pen (almost the color of a creamsicle). "If the pens seem dry, firmly press the tip to paper 3 times to re-engage the ink flow. If you love gel pens or just fun pens in general, you can't go wrong with this set. I am really pleased with these pens! The pens are inspiring me to get creative and start working in my neglected journal. Really love these pens! They all said that if I no longer wanted the pens, they'd help me out by taking them. She reports that she is now short "a few" pens, and that all the women wanted to know where she got the pens, expressed surprise that they're still around, and that they had loved them since childhood. The pens arrive in a separate plastic bag, so it's up to you to arrange them as you desire in their sturdy black plastic stand. The pens come with a top and clip and fit loosely into the stand (with a small amount of "wiggle room" that makes them easy to remove from the stand, but not too loose. The pens themselves are a nice variety of basic colors, metallics, glitter and neons - They aren't marked by type, so you'll need to write with some of them to determine which style of pen you're using. I love these pens and the price is great for 44 pens and a stand. These pens write smoothly and the variety of  colors is wonderful. I've been gleefully using these pens to sign and address birthday cards, to add a touch of dazzle and color to anything that needs a little something special. These pens, though, feel about like regular pens to write with.I
