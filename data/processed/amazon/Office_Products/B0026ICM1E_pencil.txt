Clicked the pencil twice and out comes a sharp point that well defined and clear. I found this to be a very good and very useful mechanical pencil. With this marvelous pencil and its twist and turn mechanism, I didn't have this problem. This pencil feels far more like a pen than any pencil I have ever used. It is only when you look closely at the pencil that you see it is something more. This is your basic plastic mechanical pencil with a "twist": while you are using it, the lead is automatically extended so you don't need to click the top or run out of lead.The shaft is actually wider in diameter than most pencils I have used, and very smooth, so it might be a little bit uncomfortable for some, but I haven't really found it to be a distraction. By far the best mechanical pencil I've ever purchased.My only complaint is that when using the eraser, it has a tendency to come out of its hole when used with too much pressure. I was surprised when I started using this pencil, because each time I touched the lead to paper and started to write the pencil seemed to give a little...it turns out that the tip is spring-loaded. Some might wonder why a pencil is important in this day and age when we sign computer generated documents  with pens in ink that is uneraserable "for your security". A pencil gives you a license to be creative without consequence, any error can be remedied with a swipe of the eraser and we are good to go. The only quibble I had with the pencil was I would prefer a little softer (darker) lead availability ( I will try to see if some I have work with this) but that is minor. Otherwise this is a great mechanical pencil. So when I was offered a pencil to review through the Vine program I was pretty excited to try it out.I'm worried this review is going to sound pretty damning, but this is a decent mechanical pencil overall. This pencil feels decidedly cheaper. I can see being frustrated if the pencil stops working, but the lead breaking? This pencil seems like it will hold up well, but I think I'm fine without infused diamonds in my lead.But again, I don't mean to be too harsh. It is a decent pencil. As an everyday mechanical pencil user, I find the uni KURU TOGA 0.5 to be a very nice mechanical pencil. If you aren't happy with the pencil, return it to them for replacement or full refund (written on the back of the product packaging).Overall impression is very good. I reach for this pencil every day. I gave this pencil a thorough test by handing it over to my five year old. If you are looking for a very nice pencil, get this one.It is a good looking piece of merchandise, It is a comfortable and useful writing tool. I enjoy using it.That being said, this pencil is not quite up to the standards of more expensive metal-cased pencils -- standards that picky aficionados might demand. I'd have to agree that the pencil has a higher quality than most others- the lead definitely does not break as easily, and the pencil just feels more durable than the cheap ones you can buy in any store. If you're a pencil enthusiast, perhaps this is the one for you. However, I don't mind clicking my pencil a few times if the lead breaks or if I want a sharper tip. I'm not much of a pencil user anymore. 'This pencil turns the lead so you don't develop a flat spot. I look forward to using this pencil for a long time. What I want in a mechanical pencil is that (1) it is comfortable to hold, (2) that it has a solid mechanism for holding and advancing the lead,(3) that it has a good eraser, and (4) that it has a solid clip to hold it in my pocket. Does the Kurotoga pencil measure up?Well, this pencil is clearly better than those that come 12 to a pack (and which I would rate 3 stars), but then it is more expensive. The pencil also comes with an eraser and two replacement erasers. I played around with the pencil using a firm and a less firm amount of pressure and then erased. This pencil also has a rotating lead mechanism that will keep your pencil line consistent.The pencil does not have a vanishing point mechanism and the lead does not retract. 2 pencil is the low-tech go-to, of course, but the lead is really too soft for a fine line without sharpening it repeatedly. I've never used a mechanical pencil before so I am not familiar with how to replace the lead. The pencil itself feels good in the hand, not too skinny so if you have to do a lot of writing your hand won't get tired. This pencil would be especially good for someone with arthritis in their hands. I am very happy with it and don't plan on using a regular pencil again. I've always preferred using a pencil since it's easier to fix mistakes, but I never thought there was much difference between the quality of the pencils I've used - until this one. When I was offered the Uni-ball KuruToga Twist and Turn mechanical pencil, I was skeptical about the strength of the lead but was eager to try it out.Like my favorite Uni-ball pens, the KuruToga mechanical pencil feels solid in my hands. This pencil works great! After all, this is just a pencil and not some type of custom ninja sword. That being said, this pencil does provide a unique writing experience that makes it worth its relatively high price. If all you are going to use this pencil for is just jotting notes then it may not be worth your while but if you depend on your pencil for your livelihood (as writers and mechanical draftsmen can attest to) then you will appreciate the thought that went into the design (maybe KuruToga is appropriate after all!! The pencil is nice, smooth to write. The Uni-Ball mechanical pencil is attractive and reliable. I plan to use this excellent pencil for years to come, and I give it my highest recommendation. The pencil does a fine job of scratching and tearing paper when you would like to write something with it. Who bothers to  write with a pencil today anyway? No more rotating the pencil to get to the sharp edge of the lead - this pencil rotates the lead inside to keep the writing consistent. However, using this pencil I no longer had to worry about this problem.I recently moved and couldn't find where I put the KuruToga so I was using some other pencils for a while,  but found it to be inadequate and frustrating. Who says you couldn't improve a perfect mechanical pencil? When you talk about mechanical pencil, Pentel comes to mind. This pencil is just about the right size to hold comfortably. I love this pencil! This pencil holds and protects fine leads very well, gripping the lead firmly so it doesn't twist as you write. It might just make me a mechanical pencil fan. I really like this pencil. I like how this pencil fits in your hand. Great pencil. I have since purchased this pencil in 0.3 instead of the 0.5. So, I was really happy to try the KuruTugo Twist and Turn from Uniball.The pencil itself is nice and fairly light (I prefer a little heavier pencil). I love this pencil - the KuruToga. I recommend it for all your pencil needs. However, with this pencil I'm able to use it comfortably without breaking the lead even though it is the finer, 0.5mm size. What I am saying is for most of us a pencil is a pencil is a pencil no matter if it's a wooden #2 lead or a slick looking mechanical model. Though not perfect, what is, this is the pencil as a high tech tool finally getting its 2.0 version! The uni-ball's Kuru-Toga mechanical pencil is a reasonable mechanical pencil for those of us who like these kinds of things. The pencil comes with extra leads and an eraser, but there isn't really a place to store them on this pencil. This pencil comes complete with two spare erasers and a full container of .5 mm lead. I've used this pencil for about a month now, and I can actually say that it really does resist breakage. They say this pencil is "Engineered to resist breakage". Perhaps it is just that I long ago got to where I naturally rotated my pencil as needed that I found this feature underwhelming, but others clearly feel different based on the Amazon reviews.It also is a bit thicker than the average pencil, and I put that in the positive ledger. This pencil looks pretty eye catching. Because this pencil seriously does look like a pen. Also, this pencil's tip (the end you write with) creaks with a noticebaly loud noice (of course, its pretty quiet), if I were to use this pencil in a loud room, I probably wouldn't be able to tell by just the sound. Overall this pencil is worth its price, just don't buy the "diamond infused lead" refills. This is a really neat mechanical pencil. The pencil is sleek and well balanced. This is a good pencil for general use. "This pencil is outstanding! It's a versatile pencil that can be used for note taking and all manner of transcription. This pencil assumes the work that most mechanical pencil users to do on their own by having continuing to reposition the barrel to keep the sharp point of the lead in place as the point you are writing with. This first ever mechanical pencil from Uni-ball puts the focus on the task and not on itself, making for an ideal tool for anyone who wants an unencumbered feeling when they sketch, draw or write. I have been using this pencil for about a week and generally have only positive things to write about it.It feels good in my hand. This is a well-designed mechanical pencil, worth its relatively high cost.I enjoy this pencil, and it has been a useful tool for my research activities. I have to say that the pencil actually lives up to its claims. The pencil comes with replacement leads and two extra erasers. The Uni-ball just might convert me to a mechanical pencil fan! This mechanical pencil is an effective one. So, if you don't need that, I recommend this pencil. That caused me to move to softer pencil leads which were more like writing with a crayon than a pencil. For those who need a mechanical pencil, I think this is one to consider. This is far and away the most amazing mechanical pencil I have ever used. If you really like a pencil that is very light and easy to hold, this pencil may very well meet your need. When you write you do have to lift the pencil from the writing surface periodically and the change in pressure causes the mechanism to turn.By tapping gently on the tip of the pencil you can watch the gear inside turn - it really does rotate.I did a side-by-side comparison between the Uni Kuru Toga and another mechanical pencil I have used for years. The old mechanical pencil works fine, though the lead does form a chiseled end and slowly the lines become wider and softer as I write. If you need a pencil that maintains consistently fine lines no matter how long you write, this is an excellent choice. This is an expensive mechanical pencil but it is worth it.I
