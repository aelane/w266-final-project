If you pay a normal price, you'll love it. However, given the price per roll, I was expecting it to outperform my usual brand (Scotch) that I get at a warehouse club in bulk. However it isn't so much better that it is worth the current price shown here. I would shop for price and just get whichever is a better deal. If slightly less than half the price it certainly would warrant a full 5-stars, at the current pricing of above $8 per roll I can't give it more than 3-stars as you can accomplish the same security with far cheaper tapes albeit with more layers and labor. I just can't justify the price. Also, considering the price, there are better options out there. When considering the price, I just do not see any value in this item. The price is currently high, but factor in that less is needed. Beyond this, the price comparatively is more than 2 to 3 times the price of my Scotch tape when the Scotch tape is purchased in various bundles at Amazon's current prices. Looking at the price, I might not repurchase because I go through A LOT of tape and the expense would add up. If they drop the price, which often happens on Amazon, and become competitive with the cheaper brands, I would choose this one.

For the price point, I would rather recommend Scotch Super Strength Packaging Tape, which I think is fantastic in terms of overall quality.

Made in the USA too, which might explain the significantly higher price when compared with similar products, presumably made elsewhere.The roll arrived just as we were preparing a really big and heavy box to be shipped overseas and IPG's product was great.

As other have mentioned, price is pretty much the determining factor for how much you'll like this tape.
