The paper texture makes a big difference in the end product. All of the photo paper came out great, and much to my surprise, there wasn't a huge variance in quality between the different photo papers, despite changing media settings. Loading paper into the R2880 is done by pulling up the paper support extensions at the back of the printer. Since there is no paper tray with this model, all of your paper is loaded vertically. Then there is the paper, which isn't cheap either. I do recommend using the Epson paper, as I have had very mixed results when using paper from other manufacturers with this printer. When the paper input and output guides are closed (when not printing), the dimensions are 24.3" (W) x 12.7" (D) x 8.4" (H). And when you extend the paper guides for printing, the dimensions expand to 24.3" (W) x 31.4" (D) x 16.3" (H).

I printed on both glossy and matte paper and was totally impressed with the quality which easily surpassed that of the R800.

When fully expanded with the paper trays you will need almost an entire table for this printer.I have tested the printer with various print sizes (4x6, 5x7, 8x10, up to 13x19).

If you use roll paper, you can even print panoramic sized prints at up to 13 x 44".
