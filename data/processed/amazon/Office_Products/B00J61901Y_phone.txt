I love this phone - it's very slim, comfortable and the sound quality is great. The phone itself has lots of detailed instructions, but is easy to use too. My second phone immediately charged and I've had no problems. The phone and answering machine are compact, they look nice and are functional. I am very pleased with phone and wish it had additional extensions. I think this phone is best for an apartment where you don't have to run so far to answer the phone. The phone was competing against nearly 5,000 other products from across the world.Rating: Five stars This is a really nice looking phone. I want my phone to sound like one. The phone itself is amazingly thin. First, this phone just looks neat. I had struggled through five phone systems that claimed they had what I needed. On this phone the instructions are clear enough for a child to understand.The drawbacks? Fantastic phone, it's so thin and sleek that it feels like your using a modern cell phone. The phone has a small footprint so it doesn't take up much space.
