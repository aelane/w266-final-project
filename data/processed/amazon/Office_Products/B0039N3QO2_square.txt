The square did not leave residue on my stainless steel appliances, which is nice. One square on a bottom corner of a frame is all it takes to eliminate having to go back and straighten the frame later. It is like having a little square of glue from a million post-it notes. The square of sticky stuff came off of the fridge no problem. Another peeled a perfect square of paint from the drywall, right down to the original drywall paper backing. It's like a square of tape (but it's much, much thicker), or glue (but it holds its shape and doesn't get hard), or a magnet (but it sticks to almost anything), or even a small nail (but it doesn't damage the wall, and you don't need a hammer to use it)You can use these little guys (which is what I've decided to call them) to hang up posters, lightweight pictures, artwork and photos to your walls, ceilings, fridge or similar surface. These square are pretty big. Each square is probably 2-3 mm thick, so they don't rip and can be pulled off the wall and the poster/picture.Weight:I challenged 1 square, to see how much it could handle, and hung a 11 X 14 inch picture that was on poster board. The one square held the poster for several weeks before falling off the wall. I used a little square and it worked perfectly! I used these clear square sticky tabs that look like a square of very thick scotch tape on a variety of wall surfaces with a variety of paper types from heavy cardboard to thin drawing paper. I don't know how long they will stay reusable (I haven't had them that long yet) but so far, they are very impressive.Getting one square separated from the rest was slightly challenging, but nothing I couldn't handle. per square.
