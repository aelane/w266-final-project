This product was rather promising but I ran into some issues which I'm listing below.PROS:-Tab writing: Zebra ball points seem to works really well here (my favorite pens as it is) BUT I would prefer to be able to use pencil more, it's all to easy for pencil to smear on these tabs.-Transparency level: It's very high but read cons for adhesive issues.CONS:-Note easy to write on: You are supposed to be able to write on the tabs so you can make notes and so on BUT you have to use the right kind of pen. This is great but unfortunately I don't know that this product will be purchased by me or people I know due to the issues with the adhesive becoming permanent after a while.Post-It seems to have the leading edge on this product for time being as for ease of use and not becoming permanent after a short time. Great product. I don't know how it is I never knew this product existed, but now that I've found them - I'm hooked. Nice product! This is a really cool product. Great product. What a wonderful and useful product this is. I received this product via the Amazon VINE, but am not required to 'shill' the product whatsoever: just give an honest, frank review. The product looks good and allows you to put tabs on pages that you want to mark. The only negative with this product is that pen ink takes a few seconds to dry.I was not impressed withAvery Removable Label Pad, 1 x 3 Inches, Recycled, 120 Labels (22012), but I highly recommend the Avery Notepads. Teh NoteTabs are a handy product and ink will not smear once dry. The product claims not to lift the ink on your pages, and they are reusable.Avery NoteTabs 3 x 1.5 inches, pastel blue and yellow.36 per pack (16300)Loss of 1 star, because these are shipped from China.Loss of another star because they are too long for my needs.Made in China. This is a WONDERFUL product, and I'm also going to be using it at the office as soon as possible...but I have to buy some more, since I've already used the entire package I got today! I love this product - it is a sturdy, self-adhesive tab that you can add to a regular sheet of paper to create an instant notebook divider. I can see this product becoming quite popular as people find more uses for them. Yay Avery for creating a useful product! Overall a good product with many uses.

YMMV.The product comes in a resealable bag, but the purchaser may not be aware of this.
