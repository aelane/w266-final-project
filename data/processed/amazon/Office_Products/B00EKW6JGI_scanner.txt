No actually they call me the scanner collector. What really sets brother apart in the scanner department is quality for price ratio. This scanner's insanely fast! Absolutely great scanner, you won't be disappointed! "Though this scanner is able to silently complete tasks and is able to quickly scan documents... I have this scanner setup in the corner of my office, taking up minimal desk space, plugged into power and ready to connect to the WiFi. The scanner is too big, especially with the power adapter, to carry around in a bag, definitely not a mobile scanner, but is small enough to take with you from desk to table or other working location. Instead, you are forced to hook up the scanner via a USB cable and then run and navigate through the software installer to setup the network.I can think of three easier ways: 1) the scanner already has the ability to scan to a USB flash drive, so simply allow the user to insert a flash drive with a text file containing the password, 2) the scanner could broadcast it's own WiFi network temporarily so that the user can connect to that SSID from a laptop or mobile device to enter the WiFi password, or 3) the scanner, when connected via USB, could present itself as a flash drive, containing a program or file in which the WiFi password could be entered.You might wonder why I am averse to running bloated software installers. Well, this Brother scanner software installer is a good example. Take the Canon P-215 scanner for example. Now how does the actual scanner perform?The scanner is well built. However, this scanner doesn't support scan to email like its big brother the ADS-1500W.Software: 2/5Hardware: 4/5Overall: 3/5 I love this scanner. Now you can get a decent scanner for $40 to $50. I still need a flatbed scanner for some purposes, but for my money, this scanner saves lots of time and will quickly pay for itself.
