After my printer was connected to my wireless network, I opened a document on my Ipad. Nice!Not that it matters too much, but the printer looks quite nice and elegant. I love this printer. I set the printer up myself, wirelessly, found my network, entered in the password and I was up and running!For me, the best thing about this printer is how quiet it is. This is the third Epson printer I have tried and I have found all of them to print consistently well and be very easy to set up and use. This printer seems to have even better Wi-Fi reception and the size of this printer is better than the 840 and 845 as it puts a lot of power into an even smaller footprint. Overall, this is an excellent printer of great quality and value. I've been using this printer for nearly a month and so far print jobs are fantastic. When first installing this printer, there are more steps than when you install the software on each additional printer. Something as small as this can keep your printer from accessing your network. However, once connected, my printer has never once dropped the signal, and always stays connected to my network.~Printing and ink~Printing has always worked perfectly from my Epson 3520. I scan constantly with this printer, and have had no problems with any dropped signals or anything like that.~Copying~No need to even us the computer for coping. This printer can work for the simplest tasks or can be adjusted to handle large tasks. for such a solid printer. The printer handles about 15 pages per minute (black) and 9 pages per minute in color. Well, if you had lived in HP printer hell for the last couple of years like I have then you would love this one too.I have struggled for the last few years trying to work with the most temperamental printer that HP makes. Buy this printer. Just after that, I was offered this printer through the Vine program. So I have been using this printer quite a bit and playing with the settings in conjunction with that on a regular. Overall though, probably the best printer I have had to deal with in a while and I regularly install printers for friends and at work as well. I purchased this printer because of the duplex copying and printing and because it has a wireless capability. I needed a printer with the air print feature for iphone and ipad. This turned out to be a very good printer which produced beautiful prints - both images and regular everyday printing. The printer has excellent envelope and special printing capability via a rear feed function. I use this printer at my home -- not a home office. The printer works beautifully for all my purposes. I didn't think I could love a printer as much as I do this one. Seriously, I LOVE this printer. I now have a USB printer cable, so I won't have to do that again in the future. You can set the printer to automatically pick up incoming faxes, or manually pick them up. I had suspected it was my printer that was the issue, and I was right because this one prints the coupons clearly, and every one of them have scanned now.One thing I didn't do correctly, was I had the wrong default printer set. I couldn't have chosen a better printer for my needs! Setting this printer up was easy and straightforward. This printer uses 4 individual ink cartridges: black, cyan, magenta and yellow.This printer has a lot of great features. The printer, like my other Epson printers was extremely fast to set up for my desktop and I was able to find it with my iPad as well. I have to say I am much happier with this printer / Fax/ Scanner than any other that I have ever owned. (Our former main printer is the Epson NX625 which seems to only not jam when about 30 pages are inserted at a time. I've been using this printer for over a month and it is great. Essentially, this means that I register my printer with Google. Registering my printer with Google Cloud Print was easy. I am very happy with this printer from the looks to the functionality and the price.Has everything I need, from fax to two-sided copying. The printer is lovely! While I have not tested the WF-3520 for this, I discovered from my previous Epson printer that printing only in black/white will not spare you from buying ALL new ink cartridges. The printer has worked flawlessly, quickly, and doesn't appear to have come close to using up its starter cartridges of ink.This model, while not having all of the features of the 845, could be considered a successor. What this means is you have a networked printer. Therefore you have one printer for every computer on the network. Also, this printer can be anywhere around the house.It's good to see that this printer is now priced lower than the 845 but gives pretty much all the performance. This printer is exactly what I've been looking for! -- This printer has Blue Tooth, so I can send print jobs from my iPhone and my laptop, double sided printing, full bleeds, etc. The printer is pleasantly quiet and the touch screen is extremely functional. This printer is fabulous.There are loads of additional features on this printer. The printer also uses the 127 series DURABrite ink cartridges.Also, included is a 30-page duplex auto document feeder to quickly copy, scan or fax stacks of 1 or 2-sided documents.For fax, you can fax documents directly to/from your computer and high speed faxing in black and color as fast as 3 seconds per page, speed dial storage up to 100 numbers plus fax memory up to 180 pages.EPSON Connect allows for convenient mobile printing from smartphones, tablets and more (NOTE: iPhone and iPad users, there is an Epson app available. It's a fairly easy printer to set up and to use right off the bat. Other than that, this printer is quite magnificent, I was able to print, copy, fax, scan with ease.As mentioned earlier, what I love about the recent WorkForce printers is the way it uses paper and loads, unlike many other cheaper printers in which paper gets stuck and you get the awful paper jam, I never had to worry about it with these type of printers. The printer is a bit large but was easy to set up.The Epson WorkForce WF- 3520 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer does a great job.Included:Epson WorkForce WF- 3520 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet PrinterInstruction Manual.CD-ROM with drivers and bonus software.Free sample paper pack.Power cord.Telephone cord.Dura Brite Ultra Cartridges Four 126 Series: black, cyan, magenta, yellow. It is an especially great printer for small business owners as it prints quickly and has a 250 sheet paper capacity. If you only get one printer, then this is the one. This is a very nice printer, but it is three stars and not five because installation did not go very well and I've still not gotten scanning to happen wirelessly. It recognized the printer but it could not find the drivers (the instructions tell you that this is to be expected). I love this printer! This printer has many of the features standard with most printers. I have been using this printer for a few months now and it has been working great. The printer works great wirelessly from my laptop (MacBook pro), I have not been able to get it to work from my phone (I haven't given it a huge amount of effort since I haven't had an urgent need to print from my phone, but I did try unsuccessfully for the sake of this review). It already showed up as a nearby printer, I selected it, and was done. Rest of the printer still works through, and it doesn't lose other settings like the wifi setup and such. However, this printer is a far different story. This printer is fast, and I mean fast. Sure, you can print from them, but seriously, you can be on Wi-Fi, plug a USB into the printer, and access the files from your computer. Wake up the printer, and it is there. This means you have to physically go to the printer to wake it up, which defeats some of the convenience of Airprinting from a phone. This is my first Epson printer, and I'm really impressed with it. The printer was very simple to set up and connect to my WI-FI. Very nice printer for the money. This printer was a breeze to set up on the network. It is evidently not as simple as just clicking "double sided" in the printer properties, because that didn't work. So even though the printer is large, it is very self-contained. The printer is now worthless... at least, until I go purchase another OEM cartridge.I have been Googling for the last hour, and evidently I should have known that all Epson printers do this. If the printer decides its cartridge is empty, then you will not be able to use this printer at all, regardless of how much ink might be in that cartridge or the other that the printer has." How can I force the printer to print with what I have?" Upon removing the printer from the box, I could tell immediately that from the weight and feel of it that it is not cheaply made by any means. This printer does everything I need it to do, the prints are high quality, and I am exceptionally pleased with it! This printer has lived up to the great reviews. This printer was easy to set up and my Tablets (IPAD & Kindle 8.9 fire HD) saw the printer instantly. This is a very user friendly, appropriately priced all-in-one printer. But all in all this is a good, solid printer that we'll keep for a while. Deceptively inexpensive and is a fantastic printer. AirPrint Compatible (C11CC33201) printer even if it's at sea level somewhere back in northeastern Kansas. Please note that I have tested the printer under review only while it was located in northeastern Kansas. My first printer was an Epson. However, the Canon printer can't do anything but printing. This printer can do everything you can ever ask a printer to do. It wouldn't acknowledge the specific printer model and when I tried to use a different model, the printing was screwed up and took forever. So I decided to install the printer with the disc provided (which was unnecessary for the new technology) and it took about 2 minutes and worked perfectly with that laptop from then on.Wireless Aspect: My husband and I run a dorm so we put this printer outside the apartment in the common room and the wireless connection acknowledges the printer from inside the apartment. We have the printer set on the Eco mode which turns it off when unused for a few minutes but kicks it on as soon as you print (no need for manual powering up). I have used this printer for a couple of months now and I'm pretty delighted with it. I was very pleased that this printer will produce long runs of documents (I have run 50 and 60 pages several times) perfectly. This printer performs well, is fast and print quality is very good. Good printer, does what I want it to, no problems yet as far as I can see. My first printer was an Epson, however when I purchased my Dell computer I updated to a dell printer and was very happy with it. When my last Dell printer died, I found out that Dell no longer makes inkjet printers and the cost of ink for a lazer printer is too expensive.

The printer came with everything needed except a USB cable (pretty standard practice these days).

This can be tweaked.Scanning was where this printer falls short.

Scanning via USB was faster, but not as fast as my Canon Pixma MX860.They printer's copy function worked well.
