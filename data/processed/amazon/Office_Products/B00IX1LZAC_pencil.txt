The pencil lead is a GREAT addition.....But, Now, for the pencil part..... I don't use the mechanical pencil at all. The pencil also works as advertised and the only issues are there is no lead reserve and refill it you need to feed the new piece of lead in through the point.For a plastic pen, this does have some weight and a nice balance. The pencil is the big let down for me though. This would have been helpful since the pencil part is not real intuitive. It's great that a pencil is included, as I only like to use mechanical pencils. The pencil eraser is at the top of the pen under a plastic cap that keeps it clean and safe from being knocked off. To select the mechanical pencil, the pen's "clip" does double duty. To disengage the mechanical pencil you just press one of the ink fobs slightly. Now insert a new pencil lead inside the white plastic tube and then reinsert the metal cap that you just wrestled off. And when I do need a pencil I prefer the mechanical kind over the traditional type. Grip 4+1 the pencil is always there literally at your fingertips should you need it. And it uses a mechanical pencil lead.I've yet to see how easy it will be to replace the pencil lead or the ink cartridges. To extend the pencil tip, push down (parallel to the pen barrel) on the pocket clip. Having the pencil is an added benefit, but I did have trouble getting the lead to extend. I had to feed it into the pencil. I got VERY frustrated attempting to deploy the pencil lead on this. A very SMALL, pencil, eraser - but still! The pencil part is particularly problematic (sorry for all the alliteration here), because it has a tendency to accidentally retract the pencil when you try to click it to extend more lead. When using the pencil it has a scratchy/sharp feel which I do not care for. The pencil lead advances fine, but the lever to engage the pencil function feels sloppy and cheap. The pencil feature is hidden--you push down on the pen clip partially to deploy the pencil, and then with more force to get the lead out. You should be able to refill with normal mechanical pencil lead, I'd imagine, but it does take the .7mm which is larger than my preferred .5mm. The pencil part is unquestionably a nice addition.
