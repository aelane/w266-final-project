This is a nice compact scanner and it scans both sides of pages. Anyway, I can't recommend this scanner based on my experience with it and with the company. This scanner is a bit bulky for &#34;travel&#34; but it works. I would just as soon have my old scanner that does one page at a time. The scanner looks cool, and has two cool stands and document return. This scanner works extremely well. The scanner itself is fine, the software works good, and it scans pretty quickly. The scanner has 3 parts1. The scanner itself2. This portable scanner actually scans one double-sided page faster in one pass (12 seconds) than two of my flatbed printer/scanners which require 2 passes (30 seconds per page): both scanners set at 600 dpi.Getting the system up and running takes less than an hour: log on to and register at the main internet site, download the driver which immediately provides power to the scanner through the computer's USB 2.0 port when the provided cable is connected to the Simplescan, select one of the cloud storage areas, identify desired-mail addresses, and you're up and running. The scanner provides 3 filing choices for documents: scanning to a computer file, filing the document at a selected location in the Cloud, or e-mailing the documents. The scanner produces documents from 75 to 600 dpi and presents a single-sided or double-sided (single pass) clear, legible, sharp document with accurate colors. The scanner can be utilized in either of three positions: "Vertical scanning" with the scanner mounted in a stand (which presents a small 5 inch by 7 inch footprint with 12 inches of elevation for office or on the road application), "Horizontal scanning", using a stand that elevates the scanner 6 inches off the desktop in a 9.5 by 3.5 footprint, or in "Compact Paper Return scanning" mode by just laying it on its side.Drawbacks are: no "hopper" for 'hands-free' bulk scanning; the scanner port must not be obstructed in any way (especially in vertical scanning mode) or the scan will be blurred; and the 600 dpi maximum will not allow high resolution photo scanning (in the 1200 or 2400 dpi range).Technical specifications: scanner dimensions: 12.7 in x 3.25 in x 2.25 in; weight: 21 ounces; resolution 75 to 600 dots per inch; page sizes: letter, legal, A4, A5, B5, business card, 5 in. This scanner is more than adequate for my personal and home office requirements, outside of high resolution photo scanning and manipulation which requires specialized equipment and software. As a portable scanner, the SimpleScan DP is Very Definitely Recommended. (SimpleScan DP scanner, vertical and horizontal stands, scanner-to-computer USB cable, page guides, carry case, 18 month limited warranty, and 24/7 customer support, which I have already used successfully to answer a technical question.) This scanner is okay, and for it's price point it is actually pretty good. This scanner is ripe for use with a connection directly to an iPad or Android tablet if they want to save directly to the cloud.

This scanner uses a browser based app to scan simple documents such a receipts or paper statements - things you might want a copy of but aren't worried about getting a super duper high quality scan of.

This is a scanner whose philosophy is "cloud first".

The scanner's biggest selling point isn't what I need, so in that, the scanner isn't for me.
