My first printer was a canon. My old HP All-in-One printer was starting to show its age, so I was happy to find this suitable replacement. The printer was well-packaged and easy to set up. Buy a printer that uses more affordable inks. The printer is compact and does the job but the quality printing is not the best. I must say this little printer delivers the goods in a reliable manner with little fuss. This is the second Canon printer we've owned. This is a great printer. This works much, much faster than my HP printer.

This is the second Canon PIXMA printer that I've owned.

If you Mac does not see the printer or scanner you might have to turn to the CD for drivers.I have two complaints about this printer.1.

However, if you want a great all-in-one printer that is wireless this is an inexpensive option.
