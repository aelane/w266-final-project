Great for posters, pics and anything lightweight that needs hanging. I can definitely see these as useful for hanging posters in dorm rooms or putting something on the refrigerator, but frankly the price/value equation is off on these for me... expensive for what you get. It is fine for posters, pieces of paper, etc. Definitely will use these again for any posters etc I want to stick to my wall that will not remain stuck to either the wall or poster after I decide to take them down or move them. Your posters or photos will thank you for not marring or staining them. Lastly, no more posters falling off in the middle of the night. It also didn't hold up posters or paper as well, especially after it dries out too.I have found a  lot of different uses for these sticky clear tapes/strips. I'm using it to put up posters, and to place notices on cabinets or the refrigerator as needed, but after a week of dry fall weather, many of these items have since fallen down.They need to find a way to keep these things from losing their stickiness!

They are strong enough to hold up her posters, photos and clippings, but don't leave any residue when peeled off - and more importantly, don't peel the paint off with them.

Before receiving these Scotch Reusable Mounting Strips, I was struggling to stick posters and signs to my uneven, bumpy walls with the old-school grey mounting putty.

We haven't used it for large posters, but I expect it would work well for that too."
