This is a solid printer and copier. Also, you can't initiate scanning from the printer, which is unusual.Some of these issues might seem less problematic if the user guide weren't so minimal. It's not a horrible printer, and I suspect that most of the issues are software-related. But it isn't perfect.The printer will set you back a few hundred dollars, what you get is a massive machine that is built very solid. Every printer I have owned lately has built-in wifi including those in the $50 range, for Lexmark not to include that in this printer that is multi-hundreds of dollars is just a poor decision and for that I am knocking off 1-2 stars.When first setting the printer up it will ask you a number of options like what features do you want available, just check mark the ones you do and leave the others blank and hit ok. The printer is then up and running. So that's not why I rated this printer 3 stars. I really didn't care for this printer. If you're using this printer unit primarily for PRINTING, it's definitely worth considering. Update, 4/4/2014: This printer continues to amaze. The printer has this loud annoying beep when something isn't setup correctly at first which includes Fax settings. I hit PRINT and the printer fired right up. This printer is not wireless, it takes a network cable, but any iOS devices on the network can print once you download the free app.Last topic, toner: The high yield toner seems outrageously expensive at first, I just bought one on Amazon for $203 (the printer comes with a starter cartridge). This is by far the best printer I have ever owned. It is probably twice as high as my last printer, but that isn&#8217;t a problem for me. This printer is not wi-fi and it does not come with a cable to connect it to your computer. Knowing that it's a black and white printer, it leaves me feeling that I'd tend to forget that I could still scan color content, assuming I can get through the strange process that seems to be involved.A quick summary of some pro's and con's here.Pro's:=====+ Fast (35 pages per minute is a pretty quick for printing speeds)+ Mobile print apps available - very handy for people that want to print from smartphones/tablet devices+ Large input capacity (up to 850 pages).
