Start your presentation and then begin your slide show. During a long presentation I can definitely imagine someone's thumb getting fatigued and for the life of my I can't imagine why it doesn't just feature a toggle switch.Having a 1GB flash drive is a great idea that serves two purposes. When you are giving a presentation from a computer using presentation software such as PowerPoint or Keynote, this remote allows you to advance to the next slide, move back to the previous slide, or turn the screen black so the audience is not distracted while you discuss something in more detail. I don't like being stuck behind a lectern while making a presentation. If you are familiar with PowerPoint or other presentation software, you know that the presentations consist of "slides." I fired up a PowerPoint presentation and the laser pointer buttons navigated backwards and forwards through the slides with ease. You can also halt the presentation which produces a black screen and then resume using the same button. Continue to press Next and the presentation will advance in design view. If I had a bigger presentation or more often, I would have spent the extra money and gotten a presenter with the 2 GB memory. This presentation tool is simple, elegant, and does what it needs to do very well.Simple:  When I am walking a group through a presentation, the last thing I want is to fumble finger some complicated remote. I can quickly approach 1G by storing only one presentation, which for me is a large slide decks, images, and audio & video files.2 - Some sort of storage case would be nice. Even the best presentation goes into the toilet when the person running the show can't seem to make the digital part work. Sometimes you are out of the presentation and you need to click on a movie or a link, and this doesn't do it.Other than that it is a great presenter.
