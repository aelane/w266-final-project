It seems like a great idea, but unfortunately, I've found that it just doesn't work well on all different kinds of paper - thin paper just rips rather than cuts, and thick paper can't be cut at all - and it has virtually no maneuverability, so it's really only good at cutting straight or just slightly wavy lines. This seems like a good idea; a simple cutting tool in the appearance of a computer mouse. This nifty idea allows you to cut paper on a flat surface either in a straight line or in wavy directions if that is your pleasure and especially neat for art oriented individuals. I thought the idea of the Westcott Scissor Mouse was quite unique. Cool idea! The Scissor Mouse is certainly a novel idea, and good for giving to children in lieu of scissors. The idea behind this little gadget is that you hold a mouse like object to cut straight or large wavy lines. I like the idea, but it needs a lot of improvement before I would suggest buying one. This is an interesting idea: to combine a mouse with a rotary blade and safety guard.

That isn't good.So this was a clever idea, but not very good in practice.

Love the idea, but not worth the effort of finding things to do with it!Here's a tag from the product: "Ideal for your everyday paper cutting needs at home, in the office or at school."

This looks like a good idea, but its really just a different way of packaging one of those paper cutters where you put the paper into the guide.
