That said, it is a great little printer for general use. I got what I paid for - an inexpensive printer that does some things very well and other things not so well. Since the printer was a bit flimsy looking, I was surprised at how nice the copies are. Unfortunately getting the printer to make the documents isn't as easy. This printer had rave reviews and we bought this for our son. He lives elsewhere but loves the printer. If your MAC is using OS 10.4 or earlier, this printer will not work for you. Its a very nice printer for 10.5 and I do recommend it for price and ease of setup, good pictures and etc. HP's 3050 Deskjet printer impresses me. I highly recommend this printer--very well made! I needed a printer, and after reading the reviews of the 'HP Deskjet 3050', I thought it looked the best for the price and ease of use.
