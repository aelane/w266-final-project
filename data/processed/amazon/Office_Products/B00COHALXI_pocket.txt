I liked the pocket feature and the outside pen holders. The pocket on the front is good for phones, calculator, gum, stuff like that. There is also a flat Velcro pocket which would be perfect if I was using a thumb drive to store my documents, which isn't a bad idea now that I think of it. It would have been nicer if one was a three-quarter pocket but on the left there is also a 1/4 of the way up grap pocket with an outer pouch attached to it with a flap done in two of the blue tones (about cell phone sized but not padded like you would want if you were putting you phone there so more likely for post-its, paperclips, etc. It is handy with the pocket in front. It has an exterior pocket, which is useful so you don't have to open the main compartment to access small stuff, and a very roomy main compartment with another Velcro closed interior, small compartment and lots of interior pockets. I do wish the interior pocket didn't close with Velcro, which can be noisy in the classroom. An outside zippered pocket provides further storage for more accessories.Inside the binder there is another zippered pocket for more accessories. And there's another pocket in the pencil case, large enough for your i.d., a small notepad, or whatever you need easy access to. There's a large pocket on the inside back cover and  two more pockets inside the front cover, as well as yet another small pouch that velcroes shut for spare change or your Starbucks gift cards.All you need to do is add looseleaf paper, or spirals, and a set of dividers, and you're too cool for school! I do like the pocket for pencils and stuff. I would prefer a larger zippered pocket, and the pencil holders on the outside are just silly.
