That said, the paper seems to load fine and I have yet to have any issues with paper jamming. Epson is pretty basic with it's paper choices (ALL of them Epson brand, of course) so it helps to familiarize yourself with the weight (thickness) of them if you plan to use the printer for art.The fax application works seamlessly and I had no issues with any tests that I ran (I seldom use a fax!). No paper jams or issues with paper entry & exit. I printed with cheap paper and the text did not look as good as it looks on the good quality paper. After I peeled off all of the paper labels, it actually looks rather nice. weight paper with this machine. paper first. paper, but not quite.Conclusion:I still don't know if four stars is too low a rating for this machine. I have put paper in only to get error out of paper.3) Lucy to print one photo with needing to replace all the Cart.4) I still use my handy HP. nor have I tried printing to photo paper. I ended up feeding them individually from the paper tray. I just used a plain paper setting and I was good to go! Epson encourages using their paper for what that's worth. The paper feeder is only 30 pages, but that is the trade off for the great small footprint. I would only print on photo paper with an inkjet for throwaway snapshots for kids' school projects. I do wish the paper fed in horizontally rather than vertically from the back.

Cartridge type paper feeds are, in my opinion, far superior if a little more work to load.This is a good looking printer but the build quality is really horrible.

The paper input and output trays that you have to open and close to use the printer are made of incredibly thin and brittle plastic that feel like they will easily break.

I did not experience any paper jams in my testing.Photo Printing:I tested with Epson's "Premium photo paper GLOSSY" in size 5x7.
