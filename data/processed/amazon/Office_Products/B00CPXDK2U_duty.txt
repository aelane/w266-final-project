I know this is billed as an ultra duty binder (whatever that is supposed to mean) but I don't find it particularly stout. It is supposed to be &#8220;ultra duty&#8221; and &#8220;extra durable&#8221; and the hinge does seem well made. It is significantly heavier duty than others I've bought that profess to be. It is sturdy and heavy duty. They are heavy duty, so the rings don't break, or partially separate. Idon't think this is very heavy duty, and just about average compared to othersI have seen.It is expensive, relative to similar binders available in the office supply stores. This heavy duty binder has a durable hinge. I have seen heavy duty ones before that looked like just another folder, but this one is insanely heavy duty. I was looking for a heavy duty binder to keep all of my inservice and CEU training papers in one place.

I know this is is supposedly "ultra duty" but it doesn't truly feel all that heavy duty to me...

When I first opened this I thought that it would be really heavy duty and perfect for something I use all the time.

This Wilson Jones D Ring Binder is a heavy duty binder (heavier vinyl covered cardboard).
