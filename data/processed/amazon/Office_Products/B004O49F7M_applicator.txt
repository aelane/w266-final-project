The applicator is like none of the other glue tubes that I've tried: both the sides have moveable/squeezable panels that look like large buttons, that allow you to squeeze, very gently, the perfect amount of glue out. With this applicator you can release a single drop of glue in exactly the right spot. This applicator is user friendly, fits comfortably in your hand, releases a single drop accurately, and seals well. Although I still do think that the applicator is superior to squeeze tube-types of superglue, I was disappointed when I used the glue recently and it bled through the item I was attempting to fasten, giving it an unsightly appearance. The applicator worked great for me, even with my klutzy fingers.Even better, I don't think anyone is going to be able to tell that the coffee mug was ever broken.Excellent product! The applicator is fantastic. This new applicator provides a clean, easy way to apply the glue. The applicator tip is easy to place since it's long and thin. The applicator can be wiped off and the top screwed back on. The applicator is a somewhat opaque white tube stemming from the product vial through which the liquid glue flows. The applicator on the Scotch brand is precise and easy to use, but the real appeal is the clog-resistant bottle. The applicator design is the outstanding feature of this glue. The applicator gives you pretty good control of how much is dispensed, too.Like most people, I don't use Super Glue very often, so I expect this container will be sitting around in the kitchen junk drawer for years. The applicator does a good job of pushing out a drop at a time to a narrow spot as advertised. Also, the applicator tip is designed well, no problem with too much coming out, or drips. Definately recommended, best applicator out there that we have tried and we have tried many! You don't have to worry about that with this applicator. Past purchased of Super Glue that did not have this applicator ended up drying on me or clogging. This applicator does not clog and applies a nice droplet for easy application.This product works great and does what it is supposed to do .... recommended. The ergonomic applicator is easy to  hold, screwing on the top pierces the seal on the bottle neck, and the opening is just the right size to allow the glue to flow at a controllable rate without much squeezing. The applicator worked like the bottle was new; the glue flowed nicely. The applicator does not gum up and the reuse is a positive. While the applicator may be blessed with  precision, sometimes my fingers are not.

I really like the applicator for this glue, it's so much cleaner and easier to use than those old little tubes of the original Super Glue.

That's gone apparently with this applicator design.
