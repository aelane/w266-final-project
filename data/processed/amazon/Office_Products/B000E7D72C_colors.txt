The colors are bright, the line widths are good, and the heft is perfect for drawing on the white board material. The colors are very bold and consistent....no drying out as of yet. They are comfortable to grip, and the colors are nice. I'm not sure we needed ten different colors for this purpose, but we can keep rotating colors in and out to keep things as lively as they can be when working on a white board to help teach social skills and elementary math skills.These markers come in two tip sizes- fine (a little thicker barrel than a Sharpie fine point marker) and thicker, chisel point (barrel is around the thickness of the larger washable markers children use). Then, there are the bright, vivid colors that flow from the chisel tips. The colors are not as rich when used on paper compared to using on a whiteboard, but for a general use marker, it gets the job done as well as any other.One other quality that I like with the Quartet Enduraglide Dry Erase Markers is that the cap snaps in place on the opposite end of the marker. The colors are vibrant and readable, and they tend to last quite a long time, even if you leave the cap off the way I sometimes do.Definitely worth a try. The colors look good, though they aren't as "bold" as they claim. A few of these colors are bright, but not neon.These markers erased easily, I used an old sock as an eraser. You get two of the most used colors - red, blue and black. The colors on these dry erase markers are vibrant. They are bold colors, which I need, but not crazy colors. Some of the colors in the pack of 12 are offered twice such as two blues, reds, etc.I'll most certainly be keeping these around for school, home, and work use! I love the bright colors, the fact I can see how much ink is left, the strong tips, low odor, and the easy clean up the most! Of the four colors, red seemed darkest, which I like because I use it alot and it's hard to find a good one.Surprisingly, these markers work much better than their mini counterparts. You get two each of the basic colors (blue, black, and red) and one each of the newer bold colors. The colors are bright and dry pretty quickly. Fabulous colors, great chiseled tips and easy caps for kids!We do a LOT of &#34;go to the whiteboard&#34; and do your math example, vocabulary, etc.. I like the colors better than primary colors. The colors are vibrant and easily visible (even the orange and lime green ones show up well and aren't too light). The colors are much richer and tend to hold out until the end. The colors are vibrant, which makes them fun to use. The colors are very vibrant and they are easy to erase even after being left on the board for extended periods of time. I can be so creative with all these colors as can my grandchildren who use them on their Little Tikes Easel. We really like all the colors. These write beautifully and the colors are very saturated. * The colors are vibrant and dark enough that you can see them across the classroom. * All of the colors erase easily from the board, without needing to scrub, and without leaving streak marks. They dry fast, have vivid colors, and - most important for the colors - wipe away easily even after being left on the board for a few days. These colors are strong and vivid, and I can even mark the top of a can cover with the date, and it stays until it's washed off. The colors are bright so far. The colors are extremely pigmented! All the colors are bold, bright, and easy to read. We find the colors are brighter and the markers glide across the surface of a dry erase board effortlessly.The package I received was exactly like the picture on Amazon's product page.3 Red2 Blue2 Black1 Teal1 Green1 Lime1 Orange1 Purple The colors are vivid and the varied tips make it easy to write or shade. Rich colors, easy flow, and erase easily. One or two colors are not dark/contrasty enough to be used in larger rooms of poor lighting conditions. The colors are a bit streaky, which leaves a lot to be desired.
