I then compared it to the Sharpie pen, my current favorite. It is firmer than the freebie pen and the Sharpie pen.The rubber grip is comfortable and of a generous size. On one pen I wrapped some scotch tape around the chip. On the pen I did not bind, the pen continues to drop bits of the barrel. However I found each pen to be leaky for the first few days I used them. I mean, they write and that's really what one looks for in a pen. Decent pen, feels balanced in the hand and has a comfortable grip. I never thought I could like a pen this much! When I use a pen I also prefer fountain pens or gels for the relative indelible nature of the ink once it soaks into the paper.My wife took a liking to these pens and has had me order a box for her to use at work; she liked the bold lines (though she usually prefers a 0.5mm point).Overall, good pens, some smudging on occasion. Seldom do I clip a pen into a shirt pocket, but nonetheless the addition of the silver clip does give the pen a rather sleek streamlined look.As to whether or not I'll invest in a new cartridge I'm not sure - will have to wait and see just how long a cartridge lasts. After using the pen a few times, there is no longer a problem with the ink taking a bit to dry. The pen is also very light, comfortable and easy to write with.Refills are available in both blue and black ink.A fine pen for the price. When I started using the first pen, it wouldn't write, and I thought, uh oh. This pen was an absolute joy to use. I like this pen, it writes nice and smoothly over regular paper with a thin, clear line. A retractable pen that is affordable.This is my pen of choice now. This pen might even be slightly smoother to write with than the Pilot G2. This is an excellent pen for the money.The Triumph 537 retractable is a gel-ink pen that produces a bold, smooth line without any skipping. I like this pen. For me, a pen is more of a utility product than something for artistic or creative purposes but I do demand a pen that gets the job done properly. This is a good, solid pen that delivers consistent ink and feels comfortable in the hand, even for long stretches. Though, I have realized that it is important to keep the pen from being too tilted. The pen also doesn't have any drops outs and is easy to grip. They are also refillable and that is nice when you find a pen you enjoy using. I am pleased to say this pen is very comfortable to use.In contrast, the ink is a bit erratic, since it is gel it at times dries quickly and other times takes a bit longer to dry. This new pen by BIC hasn't worked all the quirks out, so my view of gel pens haven't changed too much, but the ergonomics of this pen are great. Surprisingly, the pen is free of scratches, nicks, etc. That is why I like this new pen by Bic. I don't know what else to say about a pen -- it is comfortable to use as well.

However, I have been using this pen at work for the past two weeks.

The pen is very comfortable and ergonomically correct.
