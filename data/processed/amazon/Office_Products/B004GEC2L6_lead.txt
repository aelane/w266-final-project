Unfortunately, writing gently doesn't come naturally to him, and he's really struggled to keep from breaking the lead in the 0.7 mm pencils I have for myself.These pencils have proved to be a great solution to our problem. I purposely tried to break the lead and it is very strong and does not break easily. the thick 0.9mm lead is great for test-taking and for filling in the bubbles. and if they do, advancing the lead is much easier than sharpening a pencil.the look of these pencils isn't the most attractive, but i'm okay with that since they function well. however, the lead advance is not as subtle and precise as fancier pencils - these advanced a little too much lead for my taste. while i'd pay more for one where the lead advances in smaller increments, i understand that kids are notorious for losing stuff, so maybe the cost of a finer, more elegant pencil isn't quite worth it.i nearly deducted a star over the design, but ultimately, these are a great alternative to #2 pencils and very affordable. You want it balanced, easy to advance the lead. The lead was very stable and did not break as I scribbled a page of notes. I don't know where that one is because the .9 lead is harder to find, and often too soft to work well. The slightly thicker lead helps avoid breakage, though one co-worker described the writing feel as "waxy," and another reported that her heavy hand had a tendency to push the lead back into the pencil body. But then again, if you don't have the lead sticking far out the end this won't happen. This lead, 0.9mm compared to a standard BIC mechanical pencil with a 0.7mm lead makes a thicker, darker line and it is easier for the scoring machines to read. The 0.9mm lead in these pencils is indeed strong as advertised, but it's a bit thick. The lead is much thicker than most mechanical pencils so that's both good and bad depending on your taste. The major positive is the 0.9mm lead. As for advancing the lead, it's an easy process though sometimes it comes out too much. If I am careful, it's just perfect.Also it appears that I can add new lead to the pencils which is a plus for sustainability and saving money. The .09MM lead provides extra support and hardly breaks as most thinner leads do. I advanced the lead 2 clicks, or about 1/8". It writes smoothly, the lead doesn't break too easily, it's dark enough, and it erases cleanly. The lead is strong and has not broken once while I've used them. The 0.9mm lead allows for less breakage.-0.9mm lead for less breakage-1 Pencil = 2 1/2 wood case pencils-Smooth writing #2 lead that doesn't smudge and erases easily-Classic wood case design I also find that .9 mm lead is not as common as the .5 or .7. Now the larger lead is especially handy since it's so much harder to break. The lead is sturdy and makes a nice fine line. When the lead runs out you just take out another pencil. The lead clicks out easily and does not break off as I have had other mechanical pencils do from time to time. The lead's strong enough to stay intact, and you have enough lead to lay down some graphite.

The lead of the Bic Students Choice pencil is thicker than the average mechanical pencil, greatly reducing the risk of breakage.

I like the lead of this pencil which gives the dark, glossy lines I remember from my school days.

The lead may be that long, but it is not near as thick, of course, as the standard school pencil lead.
