A very good product. Good product. I am happy to find a product made here in the USA since it is getting more difficult every day to find products made here. This product is just what you would expect, a adhesive address label that sticks to paper envelopes and cardboard boxes. In reviewing this product, I have decided to focus on two areas: how well they do with inkjet, laser printers and pens, and how well they stick. Well not much to say about the product it is like the avery labels I use but cheaper. Overall, an excellent product, and an equal alternative to the Avery version. With a great product and the added benefit of online templates, these labels are at the top. Honestly, short of gushing about the product, what can you say that is more meaningful than that the labels do just what is expected of them.Printing is flawless on my Cannon MX310, the sheets feed smoothly even when printing a single address label in the top row, left column or 5 rows down in the middle or left column. This is a great product. I highly recommend this product. They stick beautifully and the finished product looks great. But I am very impressed with this product because:1. Really looks smart and I am very happy with this product. Removing them sometimes was a little more difficult.I really liked this product, it was easy to print w/ my ink jet and easy to remove.Most labeling pages from other brands often leave the border cutouts, so it's nice that there isn't such a border on these pages, thus making label removal much easier.I highly recommend this item. With this product, you get 25 sheets per pack, 30 labels per sheet.Unfortunately, I personally find these labels to be on the small side. It's nice to get a product that is exactly what it says it is and works as you would expect. It's hard to know what to write about a simple product like this that simply does what it's supposed to do. This is a great product. Excellent product. Overall, a pretty good product. This is a great product if you are doing mass mailings. Overall, this is a great product from 3M. Great, high-quality product that is made in the USA. I would be hesitant in using any another product, as these are perfect! I won't name the product--the odds are that you'll see at least one commercial for it on TV tonight.The lesson: labels have their uses--they help us keep stuff organized; but they also have their limitations, as any creative artist or scientist will readily attest. Another first-class product from 3M.
