Everything about this product screamed quality. I trimmed using another Swingline product, theSwingline ClassicCut Lite 15-Inch Guillotine Trimmer, Desktop, 10 Sheet (9315), which is excellent, by the way.For a relatively inexpensive laminator, this does an OK job. Another excellent product by Swingline! The product description says this takes about a minute, but I'd guess it's even a bit faster than that. But, if you either want a better product or you do a number of laminations per month, give this one a look.Setting it up was as simple as plugging it in. We use it to protect some product promo and data sheets that we have out at trade shows and displays (as shown in the picture I uploaded). This product is great for personal, household use, especially arts and crafts. The GBC Laminator is a well made product. Then it feeds the laminated product out the back. Great product! Average product, bets for small light duty jobs. Finished product sometimes hard to flatten.5. When I saw the finished product, I couldn't believe it! Overall a good product. Once it's ready, it turns out a nice product. Good product and affordable.

It looks like this product will be the same.

All in all, I am very happy with this product and can think of a hundred different ways to use it.

This means that the final product is not stiff.
