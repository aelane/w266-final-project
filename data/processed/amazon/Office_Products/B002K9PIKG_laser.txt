Easy to print to, I used them in both my laser printer and an inkjet, even though they are designed for laser printers. Some laser and inkjet printers may have this same problem, and since there tend to be margin for error on other labels, you may have a problem with these.Overall, this seems like a good value for such a large number of labels. They work well with a laser and inkjet printer, are compatable with an Avery template, and dont smudge or smear. Sending them through a laser printer is also a breeze. That easy.They say that they are designed for laser printers, but my inkjet printed well on them with no smearing. They go through my laser printer with ease, take ink well, and I absolutely love the ease at which you remove the labels off the page. )They are made particularly for laser printers. They work with both laser and inkjet printers. These are easy to use and worked well in my laser printer. While it specifically states for laser printer use, I've used it on my inkjet with no problems. They are made for laser printers and work best with one.
