Replaced this printer with a not-so-working-right iP5000. I highly recommend this printer. All in all the printer it self is a great printer and I have had no problems with it at all. I use it as my primary printer for everyday use printing photos, text, graphics and everything.My only complaint is that is does not have the LCD screen and memory card slots like my ip6600D and ip6700D had. The printer would then recognize the cyan ink tank. I had a Canon BubbleJet BJC-4200 long ago, and after that printer I was very hesitant to even consider another Canon printer. When my most recent printer died, an HP DeskJet 970cse, I needed to find a good printer that could print duplex and produce quality output. This is a larger printer than I expected, and as a result I had to rearrange my desk to find room for it. The printer itself is an unassuming-looking box of a machine, though it resembles more of a printer when the paper trays are populated.Setup was easy and straightforward, though I do recommend using the "getting started" insert before setting everything up. My previous printer would take at least a minute to print the very same documents, and it still couldn't keep up when in draft mode. This printer backs it up. Great printer, nice color, nice speed. The two printer trays are an added bonus along with the duplex features. It's too bad that Canon doesn't make this printer any more. This is my second Canon printer and is a replacement for my 5 year old i960 which I absolutely loved. The printer does NOT come with a tray (the European versions do) as one of the other reviewers mentioned. You can get the printer for a very low cost and to offset these cheap prices they jack up the prices on the ink and then put chips on them so you are forced to buy the manufacturers ink. The printer looks great, which kind of is important as it is located together with my iMac in the living room. I have a Canon A700 which is PictBridge compatible and I plugged it into the printer just to see whether that would work. I bought the printer roughly a month ago to only print black and white pages.
