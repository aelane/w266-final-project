They are poorly made and the headset jacks are loose. She needed a comfortable headset and a lightweight phone body since her calls can last upwards of an hour and she needs her hands free while using the computer or checking inventory. So I already know that I like the headset (I prefer the over-the-head band, not the around-the-ear adapter). (I'd previously bought the other headset separately, [...]This new comes with the base unit/recharger, and a wireless "dial pad" that you can clip on or carry in your pocket (it's pretty small), plus the headset, with its cord that you plug in to the dial pad's standard headset jack.The wireless connection is over the "DECT" protocol (1.9GHz frequency) so it's not going to interfere with other common household wireless signals like WiFi, nor most other cordless phones. I know this is not from the headset because as I said, I have another identical headset on another (corded) phone. The headset offers padding for the speaker.Sound quality: reasonably good, even when you are outside or far away from your base. The headset itself is nice; but, in my opinion, that should be expected from Plantronics.Here are the things I like about the phone:1) Good wireless sound quality. I do like this headset phone, however it Didnt work with my current cisco phone system, looks great and will come in handy for someone who needs dial, answer and cordless speaking capability. It's a dial-pad you can use with any headset with a 2.5mm jack (the one that's included is OK -- I prefer other styles.) I bought this because plugging a headset into a standard cordless phone often results in the volume being too quiet. If they sold a similar headset to the one supplied, but with two ear phones, I would probably buy that for conferences that I want to be more fully engaged in. Never having used a headset before, I was amazed how well a headset phone sounded. I found the headset to be comfortable enough, also, but did not use it for hours or anything.
