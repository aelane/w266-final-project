If I jot a note on one and stick it to my nice, black monitor, they're very hard to miss. I originally assumed that a sticky note is a sticky note. So, I thought about what I want from a sticky note. So, I stuck one of each note onto the dining room table (horizontally) 10 times each. The Avery note was firmly attached and flat. But the bigger negative on these is that they just don't stick very well, so as a sticky note they are not doing what they are supposed to be made for. I can stick a note anywhere I need a family member to see it. Easy to find a sticky note when you need one, even on a messy desk. It's a sticky note. There's really not much else I can ask for from a sticky note. I have a new sticky note! Where's a sticky note when you need one?These are the perfect size, and they're fairly adhesive. Have your boring note about needing office supplies noticed faster by the Office Manager! I am a sticky note freak ... And I need my sticky notes to help remind me of things to do. This sticky note cube is a convenient size for a desktop and jotting a quick reminder and the stickyness holds well to all surfaces, even after several times of taking them down and putting them somewhere else, so the "sticky" lasts awhile. I really don't require much for a sticky note pad. It also can't be so sticky that the note destroys the item it's organizing. If you were to account for your annual sticky note use, I think that you might be amazed that a small biz office consumes a couple hundred $ worth of these things. They seem to work just like any other sticky note, did not seem to "hold" more or less than competing products - which is really what you want as a product that adheres more would also be more likely to strip off paint or pull toner/print from documents.All in all, this is a winning product. Also, I put a note on some paperwork and the next day it was barely hanging on. I probably most often use the little note pages to list all the places I need to go when I make my trek into town. The sticky note is one of the world's great ideas. I do not know what would happen if the sticky note were stuck to cold glass, though.I'm glad to see Avery get into the sticky note market, as the price for Avery's product seems more competitive.
