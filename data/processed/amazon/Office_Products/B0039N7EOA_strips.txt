You get 6 strips which are very  easy to cut to the size you need. These reusable strips work well. I was concerned about peeling the strips away from paper, thinking that they might tear paper once removed. These Scotch strips are like no other mounting strips or "putty" I've ever used. The Scotch strips held it firmly in place. I used one of the Scotch strips. These are thick strips of plastic that adhere to one each side. These strips are a pretty simple idea, but it's pretty amazing what they do. now i use these strips. I have used these strips for posting artwork on the wall, and they work very well for it. These are very nice strips that are useful for hanging up things that require a little more strength than 3M poster strips, which I usually use. Six strips of 1" x 3" double-back clear tape.Q. I first got these reusable strips for my kids to use to hang their ever changing posters in their bedrooms. I love this strips! There are two strips for each bottom corner of every frame in the room. Nice and sturdy, these strips are well constructed and easy to use, can be cut to size, removes easily without marring the wall surface, and holds a pretty hefty sized yet lightweight items. I didn't know what to expect with these little reusable Two sided sticky strips!There Very sticky on both sides. These strips will do just that - and hold it (paper/object/etc) in place. The strips are made of a soft, stretchy vinyl that have moderate adhesion. Something is wrong with these 1x3 strips, they just are not as sticky as the squares even though they both say lightweight mounting. These strips are holding up a variety of cards and photos on a textured wall quite nicely. These strips are great for attaching a very light object (like a photo or a sheet of paper) to a wall or smooth surface. I used these strips to hang enlarged (8x10 and 11x14) photos of a bathroom remodel project that I had mounted on standard foamcore. I did cut some of the strips in half, but I also followed the guideline as far as weight-per-strip, using 2-4 pieces per image, based on size.On the plus side, they held for a day, were very easy to apply to the images, and came off the wall cleanly with no residue and without harming the wall. At first, I thought these reusable strips would be just what i've been looking for to hang up watercolor sketches. With the reusable strips, I can attach one side to the back of the sketch, peel off the backing, and hang the sketch on the wall. The strips peel off cleanly from both the paper and the painted wall. While the strips still do not peel off paint, they also don't hold up good-quality watercolor paper, even the small 5x7 sizes that I use for sketching. I really like these strips in principle but in actuality they have a lot of limitations. Again, the strips remained on the wall while the edges of the rug went their own way. I used 3 strips to attach it to my wall (when one theoretically should have been enough).About 10 minutes later I heard my clock falling off the wall. They will not replace "Combat" strips but that is not their purpose. These strips are so much easier! I would not expect the strips to hold a framed picture but they certainly work well on posters, photos and the like. These strips work wonderfully and I can reuse them. I LOVE these little strips -- I have several pictures and paintings in my home that are hung on a single nail or picture hanger, and I am always needing to straighten them. I put one of these strips on the back side of the bottom of the frames, and voila! I highly recommend these strips -- they are just such a convenient thing to keep on hand around the house. Will the strips come off neatly and cleanly? The strips were very sticky and held to metal and wood surfaces without problem, but when slowly peeled off, left no residue on the mounting surface, and removed no material from the photos mounted. You won't be able to use it to hang larger pictures.Basically I find the strips really good for anything I would generally use a tack to hang up. I like that the strips can be easily cut to the size you want.Too bad this won't hold a framed picture I wanted to hang (I tried--the 2 foot by 1 and a half foot picture in a thin metallic frame was definitely too heavy). The strips are packaged on clear plastic film backing, several on one large backing on one side, and strips on the other side. You peel the strips off the large backing, put them on the paper you're going to mount, peel off the strip-sized backing and stick the paper on the wall. The restickable strips were very easy to use with the posters, and I tested them by removing and repositioning the posters several times, the strips worked excellently and left no residue or mess; most importantly it did not strip away the laquer and paint that I had applied. The restickable strips are definitely great for single leaf cardstock posters, but not to be used for framed posters or multiple page calendars. The Scotch Reusable strips work great for hanging various light weight items. I used the strips to hang a large poster. The strips are double sided and a lot thicker than regular tape. I found the strips came off easily and didn't damage the wall (the strips left no residue and they did not peal paint off the wall either).I really like the way this product feels in my hand. The strips are flexible, but aren't likely to be accidentally torn. Scotch reusable strips are perfect! It's also nice to know that the reusable strips makes it easy to move and redecorate wall art with much less frustration.I'm currently using Scotch's reusable strips (one strip cut in four pieces) to hang my new Halo: Reach Limited Ed. I highly recommend these strips to anyone who desires to mount lightweight items or posters on your wall to try this out. I tested these strips with a number of different items to see how well it would hold up. I used these strips -- six per poster -- to hang theatrical movie art in a media room, but the posters kept falling off the wall, sometimes with the sticky strip still on the poster. These strips are easy to use and will hold up photos or posters nicely. These strips are thick - almost like double-sided foam tape, but the tape is clear. I used the strips to put some 8.5x11 photocopy print outs on the wall in my office. There are 6 total strips in 3 'sheets.' These strips hold items very good, but do not release for reuse at all. I was unable to get the strips to re-stick to the surfaces.on a positive note, there was ZERO damage to any of the surfaces.I've tried the yellow "tacky" gum stuff, and even though it claims not to damage surfaces, it permanently marked the back of a book case when removed later. The strips are long, but can be cut to whatever size you need. Not too happy with these strips, they are large and seem as they would hold but they continue to keep falling off the walls. Two strips on each top corner had him hanging up just fine.

These strips (cut to size) are holding photos to my filing cabinet, an envelope with stamps on my refrigerator (I could never find them before this!)

These strips allow you to hang lightweight prints or other decorations to the wall.It is a fussy product, will only cling to smooth surfaces.

These adhesive strips are a wonderful alternative.
