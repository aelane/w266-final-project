Writing a list down at night eases my mind and helps me sleep if I write a list of things I need to do the next day. Another list I do weekly is my grocery list. Lately I have been writing my list in this pad and adding to it throughout the week and then removing the paper when I leave the house.I really like the fact that this is for both left and right handed people. I write down my "Top Five" list of things to do every day. It's really an oversized to do list that I didn't find helpful or useful in my line of work. Its a nice to do list. Maintaining a desktop to-do list that's big enough to be useful and small enough that it doesn't add to your stress is a delicate dance. I tend to tuck my list in it at day's end for tidiness and privacy.+ Although the paper looks as though it would wick ink, that hasn't been a problem thus far for my fine- and medium-point gel and rollerball pens.The finish of the paper is smooth enough that it also readily accepts ballpoint ink and color pencil.- As others have noted, the articulated cover is a nice concept that doesn't function well on its own in keeping the book propped at an angle. This is a simple &#8220;to do&#8221; list pad with the addition of a &#8220;can&#8217;t wait&#8221; addendum that is perforated and can be torn out on its own. I find that when I most need my list is when I have forgotten to recharge whatever gadget I'm trying to get the list off of.If you are like me, you are multi-tasking 'til the cows come home and without a clear list of things I need to do, I am lost.I thought that this pad would do the trick. It's expensive for a list pad book, but it's very nice. I am a list maker. Having a list helps take the burden of my chores from my mind and puts them onto the paper. This to do list notebook is a fun tool for getting things done. I use it to make a list of books that I need and then detach it and take the list with me to the library. This is really a nice looking to-do list. Recommended as a desktop to-do list. If that describes you, than this isn't a bad 'to do' list. When I'm preparing my to-do list, all my notes are in one handy place.The paper that comes with the note pad is designed for a to-do list and phone messages. I either want to take the entire list with me, or if I have to scribble a hasty note I reach for a smaller scrap of paper. I think it's very handy to have close by when you have a list of things running through your mind that you need to jot down somewhere.My favorite use for this item is making a chore list for my kids. If I give them a list of say 4 things to do, they may only remember 1 or 2 of the things. With this list they can check off what they've done and see what still needs to be done. It can be a list of chores that need done over the course of a few days. My to-do list would look something like 1.I
