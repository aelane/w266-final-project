This is a very well made and easy to use phone system. I tested the phone, to see how far away I'd be able to use it, and was very pleased to learn that I could make and receive calls up to 650 feet away from the base. This enables me to not only use the phone within my home, but also when I'm working outside. Perfect phone for a small office that you can add lines to later if you want. This phone has a very long range. I bought this phone to replace an earlier model of Panasonic phone sets that we had for years and loved. The phone book is over 3000 slots and the the Call Blocking allows 250 registries. I just had to replace my Siemens phone set that I have had for 15 years. I wish the phone had the ability to record your own name for the numbers.So in the end this phone has a lot of features that in theory are great but in practice are cumbersome and hard to use.

At least for me, cell phone pairing seems to work better when the cell phone(s) are near the base.Once this is done, I can essentially completely forget that I have cell phones when I am home.

They are more than likely downloadable from the Panasonic Web Site or available elsewhere on the Internet.Receiving a phone call on either cell line works seamlessly; just answer the phone using any handset.

We bought this phone to take the place of an older Panasonic phone/answering device.
