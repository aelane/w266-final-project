I like that it has plastic pockets in front and back so I can put a picture or paper in each side to have a visual representation of the category of the binder. The clear pockets on the outside are a nice touch to have to make something easily identifiable.This is the kind of thing that fits in exceptionally well in an office or clinical setting of almost any sort. Two internal pockets and a sheet of plastic which allows for the insertion of photos and labels makes for good storage.The overwhelming negative is that this is poorly made. The 3 outside pockets let me insert (or not) a 8x10 picture on the front and back, in the spine pocket I usually put a bookmark I have acquired at some bookstore in the past 12 months - lots of great memories. The two inside pockets are terrific, I am hoping they will change them to full page instead of the current third of the page they are.I loved the color - I usually use white or blue and the color adds to the display. Inside is also has 2 interior pockets. It has pockets on the inside of each of the covers which are useful for holding stray papers. There are two flat rectangular pockets inside for loose papers, and on the outside there are 3 full-size pockets for the cover and spine. This is orange.The clear exterior pockets feel sloppy to me. I do like having clear pockets on the covers. pockets of the same material inside. It's sturdy and it has pockets. I like having the clear plastic pockets on the outside, where I can easily put sheets of paper to label the contents. The pockets hold a limited number of pages.On my binder the rings are stiff and hard to open. Inside, there are plastic pockets on the front and back covers that will hold cards, smaller or folded papers, a few paperclips or other small items.Outside, the colors are bright, and you can insert labels and cover sheets into the front and side. Inside clear pockets run 3  inches up the covers to keep loose papers in place and there are covered full-length clear pockets on the front, back and spine for labels.Time will tell how long it will hold up before the seams weaken, but it seems quite well made.
