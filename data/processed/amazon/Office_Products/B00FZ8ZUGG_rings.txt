The D rings accommodate more paper than round rings and the construction is such that the binder lies flat when in use. The &#8220;D&#8221; shaped rings are a definite plus, as they help store paper more easily, and allow pages to be flipped more freely.The binders themselves are what you would expect, with plastic sleeves on the outside front, back and spine, into which you can slide paper with titles, labels, artwork, etc.There are two interior plastic pockets, one on the inside of each cover.The hinges work nicely. Not so here &#8211; these rings snap together very nicely.The binder is advertised as being made of a &#8220;polypro&#8221; material and lasting up to 10 times longer than vinyl. The 3 rings inside are heavy duty and it takes me both hands to unclick. It has D-shaped rings, which I kind of like better than the more circular shaped rings. The &#8220;never-gap&#8221; rings have the opening toward the top rather than the center of the ring. I actually am starting to prefer the &#8220;never-gap&#8221; rings because they make the notebook easier to load.FEATURES:&#9658;  Customizable cover and spine simplify binder labeling and personalization&#9658;  1 1/2 inch D-ring binder holds 400 sheets&#9658;  Features our strongest binder covers and extra durable hinge for years of reliable use&#9658;  Custom formulated, PVC Free polypro material lasts up to 10x longer than vinyl&#9658;  Never-gap rings close tightly to keep papers secureThis is a great size for a notebook and I&#8217;ve already filled up the ones I have. The rings are easy to open, and even easier to shut. The D-shaped rings seem to make it a lot easier to add pages, as well. The rings are very tight, and should avoid the separation or off-center effect by the way they come together (a small cylindrical extension goes into a hallowed out partner half-ring rather than the typical ridge closures I've seen in other binders).I believe the D-rings hold more pages, while the circular rings may be easier to flip through. I like the D-Ring compared to the Circular rings that often get off center and papers stick instead of sliding over. The rings open and close with ease, and the vinyl covering is smooth. The rings close tightly, and the plastic pages do not get caught on them. The D rings are mounted so that the pages stay flat when I open it up. These rings help to prevent that.The claim is that these Polypro Binders last up to 10X longer. It also has the wonderful D rings with the dimple to hollow closure. The rings also close super tight and pages don't get caught on them while being turned. The rings are somewhat easy to open and close for me, but it does take two hands. Finally, I love that the rings are D-rings and that they're mounted on the back cover rather than on the spine so that my pages stay nice and flat while in use. The rings close tightly allowing for smooth page turning and no worry about annoying snagging of paper when the paper reaches the point where both sides of the ring meet.
