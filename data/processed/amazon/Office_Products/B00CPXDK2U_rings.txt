The rings are not the old ragged jaw type, they have a piece of metal that sticks into the corresponding ring which makes the whole thing very smooth when closed. I also thought that the rings were easier than most to open and close, which is a big plus. The rings claim to never gap and cover is supposed to last 10x longer than the average binder. The rings have a lever on one side that opens them, and it opens very smoothly, but it's much easier to close them by just squeezing the rings. The rings seem reasonably strong, but not as strong as the marketing for this item would make you believe. I also like how rings are shaped to let pages stay flat.I'm not sure what they mean by 5 year guarantee. The rings are a D-Loch spill-free style. The rings are guaranteed "never-gap." I like the that the 3 rings all open when you push the tab. D rings, I am very impressed. Once that was broken it was impossible to open and close the rings of the binder (basically making it useless). I had to pry open the rings to remove all of the pages from the binder. The rings are supposedly "never-gap." The rings lock into place, another nice feature. Second, the rings are not on the spine, but on the back, and that allows the binder to open perfectly flat. the rings don't separate easily and let your papers start falling out -- which is always so aggravating. This is because the rings have a tiny pin on one side that fits into a tiny hole on the other side. you can LITERALLY open the rings of this binder with one finger. it also seems like the rings will never become misaligned. To open the rings, you just push a button and they pop open, easy peasy! I love that the rings are mounted on the back cover, instead of the spine. The rings are extremely easy to open and they snap shut very tightly. The rings are about average and look sturdy enough.
