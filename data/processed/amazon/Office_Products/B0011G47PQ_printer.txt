The printer is big, so measure your space before ordering it... The printer does not have a network jack, which is disappointing, so you will need to connect via USB. The Epson printer software made it easy to tweak settings for the photos, there may be a bit of a learning curve with some of the terms.Overall I'm very pleased with the quality. This is a fantastic photographic printer. This printer is set up for photo paper and it puts that nice coat on the entire page even the part that doesn't have any color printed onto it. I purchased this printer so I could make larger-format prints of my watercolor paintings, which are pretty detailed and vibrant.I'll skip the technical details and get right to the stuff that always vexes me as far as printers: color calibration.It's taken me about two years to finally figure out how to calibrate this thing so that the colors weren't "muddy" and muted on my prints. This is the first printer with it, even the current Epson Pro printers don't have it. The printer recognizes you are doing it, then grabs the paper to feed in to the proper starring point.If you print multiple images, the printer spaces them 1" apart. This printer holds up there as well. I have to say that this printer has been blowing me away! I give this printer both thumbs up and highly recommend it. The printer takes 8 small individual ink cartridges (5 color, two blacks, and a gloss optimizer), which sell for about $15 (you get 4 gloss optimizer cartridges for about $16, which suggests to me that the printer drinks this stuff like Kool-Aid!). The printer uses the latest Epson Hi Gloss 2 Ultrachrome pigment ink, which according to industry standard setter Wilhelm Research has fade resistance of up to 200 years, depending on the paper usedThe controls on the printer are quite simple, consisting of an on off switch and three buttons that control other aspects of printer life. There is no LCD on the printer. For a printer of this size, it is fairly compact. The printer is attractively and simply designed. The printer body is primarily plastic, but feels of high quality. The printer inspires confidence in terms of build quality. The printer comes with a full complement of inks (I am assuming that these are filled to capacity, but this is not clear to me). The printer driver is easy to use, and fairly intuitive.I have tested the printer out on a variety of papers and sizes:1) Canon Photo Paper Plus Glossy (4 x 6);2) Inkpress Lustre (5x7);3) HP Premium Glossy (8 x 10).The output produced is simply stunning. I look forward to working with this printer in the future and further exploring its capabilities.Very highly recommended! They are also difficult to find as this is a new printer but I believe they'll become more common.Cons:* Antiquated epson software that looks like it belongs in OS 9* Didn't come with a printed manual. Once you get the printer de-taped, you'll find an assortment of ink cartridges, and, *generously*, an extra gloss optimizer cartridge.
