I purchased this all in one printer and just love it. I would highly recommend this printer to anyone. I wanted to purchase a new printer since my Epson (5 years old) was not printing properly due to it sitting around, unused, for a few months. The printer works fine but it definately did not load properly.Lastly, there is a USB port in the front of the unit. Where I have my printer located is on the very back of a large desk. So far, I am very happy with this printer. I purchased this printer to replace the last in a series of 4 HP inkjet printers I have used over the years. Using this printer (for all functions) for more than a year now, I would like to point out some stuff I did not see others mentioning them:Pros:-Always shows time and date on LCD-Software pretty good. So be careful and don't drop your printer.) These printer cartridges appear to be the same size but they have a chip which concerns me a bit.The only reason I did not give this printer a five star rating is because my lack of experience with it. This printer takes up quite a bit of space on my small desk. All in all, this is a fantastic printer with excellent features and I'm glad I decided to purchase it.
