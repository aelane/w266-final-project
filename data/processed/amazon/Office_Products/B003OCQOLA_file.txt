I prefer this expanding file to the zip around one. This expanding file was the perfect thing. MOST expanding file folders do not have this much reinforcement. I got this expanding file to sort my old Lego catalogs in, and overall am very pleased with the quality and construction. Excellent expanding file. If you are looking for a strong file folder that won't be holding too much this would be a good way to go but if you are looking for something that you can cram all sorts of papers in and want it to stand as you are looking through the pockets I would suggest you keep looking. This is a fairly attractive and sturdy expanding file. We used this expanding file specifically for his housing applications. He knows this file is his &#34;housing&#34; file and it has just enough pockets for that purpose. This expanding file is just what I needed to store paid bills.I'm not a very organized person and often end up stacking the paid bills.I do mark the date I paid them on the bill, but end up eventually tossing a mixed stack of statements into a bag and storing it away.This file lets me keep like bills together and easily tucks into my filing cabinet.Surprising how much difference inexpensive tools can make. I was so pleased when I got this expanding file. And, the expanding file has arrived just in time for a huge project include a move through five States. It's more than just an expanding file folder, which is what makes it stand out among the other offerings in this space. This expanding file comes with tab labels, for goodness sakes! This expanding file met my needs for easily helping me sort and file papers on my desk. I never thought I needed an expanding file, I figured it would be a one-way ticket to carrying more papers around than I already like to be saddled with, but boy I was wrong. I found this file incredibly helpful in enabling me to organize the various activities of all my clients instead of carrying a bunch of different file folders. I've used this file happily a few times to tote important documents, but for organization, I still think you can't beatWilson Jones Big Mouth Vertical Filer Organizer, 5.25 Inch Expansion, 10 x 12 Inches, Color May Vary (W68584A). So this file will hold about 1 1/4" worth of documents. Five Star has manufactured this file using  sturdy plastic...the colored portion/plastic shell of the file, in my case black, almost feels like it could cut me, but I know it won't. Use the file with 8.5" x 11" sheets. The file does expand but is limited to the width along the bottom which is about an inch. However, I don't plan to try and overstuff this file, and the one inch width is fine with me.As for any nitpicking on my part, while the item does indeed have six pockets, there are only five internal, tabbed dividers that can be labeled, so either the very front pocket or the very back pocket won't be labeled. I really like this expandable file. While I think that helps with the file's flexibility I am wary of smaller papers falling through and disappearing as they move into the wrong tab. This is a good designed file folder. I've never been much for keeping myself organized, but this file gives me more incentive to.The pockets are fun. This file is fine the way it is. This is not a giant, expanding file for storing ALL your records. A very simple expanding file. What can I say, there's not much to say about a Five Star expanding file that most people don't already know. This is a decent, functional file that will hold a short stack of papers. The self-lid is scored to stretch over a filed file and an elastic strap secures it closed. This file is made of thick (but flexible) plastic and the clasp uses fairly strong elastic cord which fits over a button on the front of the file.
