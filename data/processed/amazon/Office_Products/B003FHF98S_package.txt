This handy package has two of each type of dispenser.. four in all... plus six pre-cut sets of tape strips refills. I almost tried ripping it off when I first opened the package because I assumed it was a backing to some sort of adhesive.Once on your desk or counter, you can easily slide the dispenser around, but when trying to lift it up, it'll stay stuck. Now this new package comes with two of the handband dispensers. The package even comes with refill packs. This package include two nifty little dispensers you actually attach to your hand..no more messing with one hand trying to cut and apply tape to the holiday package. The package comes with 4 dispensers and plenty of refills that will see you through this Holiday season as well as being there for everyday taping. The package comes with four dispenses and six refills tape packs - enough for wrapping gifts for the whole family, neighbors and friends. The package contains two of each type and I keep one set at work and one at home.The Scotch Pop-Up Deskgrip Dispenser came in two colors, white and blue. This handy package is the best product I've ever received from Scotch. This package has two dispensers, one for the desktop, and another for the surface underneath the desktop, where it can be reached conveniently but is difficult for loved ones to pry off and steal.If wearing your tape is the only way to keep those people you love more than all others from stealing your office supplies, then the handband dispensers might be right for you. The package includes two handband and two deskgrip dispensers. The package says that this dispense is not intended to be refilled, however, this is not the case.
