You wouldn't use this label to block out something already printed on the page.The label itself is 3" by 1" and comes on a pad of three pastel colors (light beige, sky blue, and avocado green), 40 of each. Also, while the label can be reused, after the first use the adhesive properties degraded rapidly, with curling at the edges after a few hours. The label performed very well in this regard. But as a temporary label, it's quite handy.Bottom line:This is essentially a "sticky note" label made from 80% post-consumer paper, with adhesive that seems a little less sticky than the standard 3M Post-it adhesive, but does what it claims to do and could be a nifty temporary label for jars, cans, cardboard boxes, etc. Then, I tried to use the label on the outside of an expanding file that was made of paper. Avery's removable label pads consist of colored labels which at first glance seemed more like mini post-its. However, the entire label back is covered in adhesive, not just a small portion.These labels are great for temporary labeling purposes, such as file folders, envelopes, or papers. That's nice if you truly want the label to stay in place for only a short time. Therefore, you can place the label on a surface, then tear off the perforated end and have an entire glued surface touching whatever you have attached it to. The label on my jewel case was starting to actually peel off on its own after two months, so they are not a long term labeling medium, but that's not what they are for, right?Back to the comparison to Post-its that I mentioned above. When the label gets full of writing, I'll just peel it off and throw it away. You peel the label off of the pad and adhere to a surface. There's no residue when you remove the label from the surface.However, what I found is that the stickiness was inconsistent. They don't stick on everything.These will be very good for putting a temporary label on a paper surface. you want the label to stay on) these will not work - they will eventually curl and come off. You can peel the old label off easily and put a new one on.I really like these and have found several other ways to use them. To say it is just a label is an understatement. I would opt for another label first or just not worry about printing them. Sure, it's a temporary label but it should stick! I peeled and pasted the label on and it didn't take long for the edges to start curling up. That's not good for a label. Each label peels of separately. The final label has a uniform box and frame.A final note, the plastic bag these labels come in is resealable. I also left a label on magazine print for a long time under pressure and when I lifted it, the label did not take an image from the magazine page with it, which is a good sign that the glue is not so strong that it will ruin any print.If you like labeling things, I think you'll like these pads. It doesn't tear off easily after the label is applied because it tends to pull the label off but tears off easily prior to application or after application if you tear it halfway first. With 120 tiny label pads in all, these are great to use in books, file folders, box labeling or even as a quick post it for yourself. Write on a label, peel it off, stick it to what you want labeled. It wouldn't be a reliable label to use for mailing.Surfaces that are in motion such as the spines of books will cause the label to pop off. Exactly what you want a label to do.The only drawback (which is mentioned in the description) is that they are NOT computer printable. Additionally, for me personally, I never reuse a label. I stuck, unstuck, and restuck the same label on just about every surface I could think of...wood, stainless steel, paper, plastic. The entire label is sticky, except for the tab on the end, which can be easily detached (it is perforated). I used the label pads to label my file cabinet folders. Ever find that you need a quick label that is easy to remove, but that has more permanence than a "sticky" note? Nothing worse than getting a label on and realizing it didn't belong in THAT spot. I like the removable label idea and it certainly works but I still need it to last a little longer than a day and through mild temperature changes. Most of the label has glue on the back. It's nice that the whole label back is sticky rather than just a bar of stickiness found with your typical Post-It note. Sometimes the label would curl up on the edges.

What I don't know yet is how long does the label stays in place.

When you want to put a label on something, you want the label to stay there.

Then, when you apply the label - that curled part will pull away by itself after a few minutes.
