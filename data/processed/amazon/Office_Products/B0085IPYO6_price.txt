If this was about one-fourth to one-fifth the price, I would buy a bunch of these. I am not overly happy with the price either. If the price drops drastically, I wouldn't hesitate to buy more. What I don't like about it is the price. If it were half the price it would be more reasonable. I am NOT getting the price. Aside from the hefty price, I see little difference between this and others I've purchased just like it in the past for much less. I'd expect to get 3 of these for the $10 price listed, and overall would not recommend it for general use unless they reassess the price. The price is outlandish for a unsturdy cardboard box. I don't know what it is and at the price of this part of it, I am not interested in finding out.If you just need a box, even one sized to fit letter paper, there are better made, more logical, sturdier, boxes and containers out there for a much more economical price. Second, it is not strong enough or attractive enough to justify the ridiculous price. Finally, I think the current price ($9.99) is too high for this product, considering how flimsy the box is, how useless the handles are, and how it does not even come with the file box cover. Pretty good for (what I thought would be around) $3.And then I looked at the *actual* price on site, not the one I had made up in my head: $9.99. I would expect at least three or four for this price; one for ten dollars is ridiculous. But for the price they're charging for this I'll cut my own cardboard box out of the ones Amazon packs their products in!Now if this were cloth covered cardboard I might be a little more comfortable paying some money for it. Except that I thought the price was a bit high for what you're getting. It's just not worth the high price. It is certainly not worth the price tag.
