The markers aren't too smelly, they write and erase cleanly, and the caps are easy for children to snap on securely so the markers don't dry out. These markers, particularly the blue and black, do leave that stain. I think BIC markers are high quality. These markers work great for dry erase birds. The markers work great and having the eraser and the spray are nice bonuses. The markers write very nice, clear and great strong color. I've used the Bic markers before from another package and I feel the same about them. While the markers have a good color and the odor is tolerable, the cleaner was completely useless for us. The markers didn't have much odor, and the eraser fluid, which usually smells strongly of ammonia, smelled more like an everyday household cleaner. The markers are vibrant in color and wipe off easily with the included eraser. There are two black markers and one each of green, blue and red, so the usual colors are represented. The markers do leave behind a stain, so you do need to use the cleaning solution that comes with it (and it works). The Bic markers are really nice to write with. The Quartet markers have not-round caps, so they don't roll of the table, and a window so you can see how much ink is left - both nice features that the Bic markers could use. However, the Bic markers have a much nicer feel for writing.The spray cleaner for the white board is simple and effective, no competitive advantage either way.The Bic eraser is novel, though. The markers are the smaller-size pens, so they are easy to use. The markers aren't top notch but they work relatively well and are very bright and vivid. She goes through markers like crazy.This set is very convenient if you need everything. You get five markers (2 of the black), an eraser, and dry erase board spray cleaner. The markers are what you expect- high quality, thin but strong tip, and comfortable, even for a 4 year old. The markers left some smudgy residue on my home grease board, which is not elementary-school quality, but not your kitchen variety, either. The five markers look sharp, have little odor and write well, the eraser removes the markers fairly easily and the dry-erase cleaner does a good job removing marker that has been on a dry erase board for a while.I tend to use dry erase boards for projects and then I don't use them for a bit. I then used these markers on the board and then used the eraser to remove the ink and it worked fine.I always check to see about potential toxic issues with cleaners. Dry-erase markers fit well into their line of products.These dry-erase markers have a nice dark color when used to write on dry-erase boards.The eraser works very well, though some colors (like red) can sometimes be a tad more stubborn to remove.The spray bottle is very effective at getting the rest of the marker off the dry erase board, butbe sure to USE A PAPER TOWEL when cleaning it, not the eraser (as suggested in the directions. The markers - I can't say that they're particularly low-odor, since I don't find most dry erase markers to be odorous. The markers were nothing special compare to other competitors. Getting the markers, an eraser, and the liquid cleaner for the current Amazon price is not a bad deal at all, and again very convenient. These markers are great.... great rich writing and erases easily...I've used them for a few weeks and have not peeled away an erase level or used the cleaner fluid yet.Good kit! The markers write boldly on a dry erase surface, and erase completely (I haven't had to use the cleaning solution yet). The markers have a rubber grip down towards the bottom - its nice but didn't make a big impact for me because I don't use the markers "that" often. These markers truly are low odor. The markers are fine tip - another must for my application, it's non-toxic and low odor.
