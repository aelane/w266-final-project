I don' know about you, but in my filing system I have all kinds of folders that are so old that the tab is crumpled, faded and torn. Now they make a filing tab. These Post-it filing tabs are great for quickly sticking onto folders, pages, notes and the like. These filing tabs do the job - whether using in a binder, manual, cookbook, whatever filing task you choose. These little filing tabs are great for all sorts of purposes. These durable filing tabs are a fanstastic idea that needs more work.What I like about them is:- These tabs are tough. How much can you say about a filing tab?You probably care about a few things:1. I had just purchased these same filing tabs at Walmart. Then the whole filing tab could be reused.I use filing tabs for yearly planners that have no dividers as far as the months are concerned, so that I put the filing tabs on the sides of the months where the 2 pages are for each month at a glance, so that I can see where the next months 2 pages are, then I mark them with another filing tab.In summary, I think fiing tabs are a great thing to have on hand for many different uses, but for me personally I prefer filing tabs where the part that you would write on is brighter in color, and that the colored part of the filing tab covers a larger area of the the tab before you get to the opaque part of the tab, and that the entire filing tab is not the same shape, like the Post-It filing tab is, both on the part that you would write on and the opaque part.They also make filing tabs that are more like a half moon shape at the top of the tab, the colored part of the tab.Juat decide what kind of tab you will need for the project that you need a filing tab for, if you need a brighter color for the part you would write on or not, look at your various choices then go on for there.These Post It filing tabs are ok, they just don't work as well for me, for what I need them for. I use these Post-It filing tabs for my hanging file folders. These Post-it filing tabs work well. I used them to help organize my disorganized personal filing cabinet. These filing tabs are so user friendly - easy to use and reuse, and easy to spot. I actually liked the Post-It filing tabs. But, I can with these Post-It filing tabs. These little filing tabs are great and they suit their purpose well. These Post-it filing tabs do exactly what they are supposed to do. These filing tabs are a great addition to your business or home office.

All my filing cabinets and hanging files are legal size, whereas the vast majority of my papers are letter size.

These are the first filing tabs I've ever seen that actually have an aesthetic quality to them.
