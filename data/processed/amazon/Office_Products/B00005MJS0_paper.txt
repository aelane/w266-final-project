I bought this paper after purchasing an Epson Aritsan 730 printer, only to see it not show very good print quality on generic printer paper. I had tested the Epson Photo paper, and found it to be superior in quality to the HP premium paper that I had used for Photos, so I figured perhaps I needed to go with better paper for my basic printing as well. I typically use Boise X9 Bright 20lb paper in both my laser and inkjet printers. If you are looking for a thin paper that reproduces well and is easy to work with, this is it. I recently tried this paper to use with my HP inkjet printer that is about two years old. I use this paper with my inkjet printers; and I can use it to make signs to tape to my front door indicating to delivery people which doorbell to ring! The paper may "buckle" ever so slightly if you have to print a large square, circle or rectangular shape in a single color; but this "buckling" isn't too noticeable.In addition, this paper practically never jams in my printer at home. Nevertheless, I always fan the paper to make extra certain that it doesn't jam. After I fan the paper to make sure two pieces of paper aren't stuck to each other, then I place it in my inkjet printer tray.Each page is a clean cut 8  inches by 11 inches. Although they don't say this, I would imagine that this paper can also be used in copiers, plain paper fax machine and maybe even in laser printers. If you want to use this paper with laser printers, print out a test page or two before you buy several reams.This paper never "goes stale," so stock up on it if you can catch a sale on it. This is great paper and it produces excellent quality output. Just saying - it's a quality paper, well worth the price. Bought this epson paper to go along with new printer. This paper costed a bit more than what I wanted, but it seems to be of good quality, thickness, and brightness. This paper is fine but in comparison to another brand we use (of the same weight and brightness), it is nearly as substantial feeling or looking. As far as paper goes, it's not bad, but maybe not the best brand out there. Thinner paper works better in our printers - Canon and HP's.
