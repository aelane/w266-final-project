To allow for easy label removal, we fold a a small section of the label tape back onto itself.In the final analysis  the Post-It Super Sticky Removeable Label Roll is extremely practical and multifunctional. This label roll is one extremely helpful little thing. The label comes off without tearing the paper it was put on.Make your own page flags by folding over part of the short end and they can stick out of a book or magazine or cut it in stripe (width-wise) and you have flags for sections you want to find again if you don't want over the edge flags on the page. I tested the Post-It Super Sticky Removable label on four surfaces: metal, plastic, leather (smooth), and paper. The label did not fall off, and after it was dried...amazingly it was still adhered to the surface. The label is NOT waterproof and there is no claim that it can withstand this punishment, but it is interesting that it survived getting wet.There are no real "negatives" but some considerations:  Certain plastics may decrease the effectiveness of the adhesive. I like that I can make the label as long or short as I need it so I have room to write, but don't waste anything. This label tape works well on rigid things such as boxes and containers, but does not work well on jars, bags, or other items not as sturdy. This removable label tape or "Label Roll" is a good product because it allows you to make 1" high labels of variable length that can be easily written upon and affixed to an item, box, etc., and be effectively either a permanent or removable label because of the nature of the adhesive on the side opposite of the side you would write upon. The label tape is held in, and dispensed from, a container similar to a scotch tape container and its length is determined by where it is torn off the roll using the serrated edge just as scotch tape is torn from the roll. The label strip can be a bit more versatile than the pads of Post-It Notes since the stickiness is spread all over the strip. While this Post-it label roll is good and doesn't leave any sticky residue, it didn't last very long and had a tendency to fall off, whereas blue tape will stay on much longer.Overall, it's a good option for temporary labeling. Forget it, the label just falls off. I have a label maker, but that seemed like overkill. I was totally skeptical of this label roll for some reason; maybe it was the fact that the labels are removable (and I assumed that meant they wouldn't stick), or because they're wider than the replacement labels I'm used to... who knows? With the Post-It label roll, which comes in a dispenser not unlike the dispenser for transparent tape, the user can control the size of her note. And you can write on them like any label. The Post-it Super Sticky Label Roll is easy to use...but you might need to tear the label off slowly to prevent leaving an uneven edge. This label sticks to anything you'd expect a Post-it to adhere to..and of course, the label can be removed easily without leaving a sticky residue. I haven't used it long enough to know how well the label holds over time or when used in places without climate control, but so far no complaints. The label itself stuck quite nicely to a book, my desk, the computer and my plastic storage bins (will be curious to see if they have staying power after a few weeks), and easily peels back up. Once you've stuck your label to something and then peeled it back up they seem to lose their staying power.12/13/10 ETA I have just checked the three Rubbermaid storage bins I attached labels to. No only can I decide how big a label I need, but it's a lime green, so it is eye catching. This label roll is a very nice addition to their product line. This is a great versatile label tape that comes on a dispenser like Scotch Tape. The Post-it label roll seems even more basic than normal Post-its but even more indispensable.Regular Post-its have a sticky substance on a small part of the square paper. I like that the label surface is larger and easy to read on the high color contrast paper. I sometimes tore it a little unevenly which made the current label, and the next, uneven on one end. If you want a permanent or more professional label I would chose one of Post-it's other labels.

But with the Label Roll, you use only as little or as much as you need - the label tears off much like an adhesive tape dispenser.To avoid oddly-shaped and torn labels, roll your desired amount and press the label down onto the cutting teeth with your thumb as you rip it off.Once you get started with this product, its uses become endless.

I don't expect the label to stick for very long, if at all, but if they do stick, I'll amend this review accordingly.Because they use a removable adhesive, they're not going to stick to a lot of things, but I find they will stick to most very smooth, non-textured surfaces.

And put a label on a piece of rough plastic such as a trash can?
