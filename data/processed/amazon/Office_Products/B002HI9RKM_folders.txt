I love these folders. These folders are much easier to move across the rails when they are full and they don't get bent when they are filled to capacity. They work well with my existing folders, but, they do take up a bit more room on the rods as they are thicker on the top. I expect these folders to last for years with regular use, probably a lot lot longer with only occasional use. These folders really do have longer hooks so they stay in place no matter how full the file. It is hard to describe how impressive these folders are. These folders are TOUGH. OK, so they're file folders. Comparing them to some Office Depot and Quill folders I have, the only difference is that the hook is a bit longer, maybe 1/8". This folders provide a superb way to keep your files well identified by color coding. Definitely nicer than off-brand folders and Pendaflex's standard folders.PROs:- Glide nicely on metal rails- Reinforced with clear laminated plastic at bottom and tops- Strong cross-bars. These folders are truly the best I have used yet. These hanging folders are very durable and good-looking in an assortment of colors. Unlike the folders of a previous generation with their drab olive green color and annoying metal rods, these Sure Hook Hanging File Folders are bright, light and generally just right.The plastic rods that hold the file folders don't appear to cut into the cardboard like the folders of previous generations. These are Pendaflex folders and, believe it or not, they are made in the good old USA. These Sure Hook folders are perfect for someone who files often or uses their files to store heavier contents. The folders come in a five-color assortment in a dispenser box. First of all, the folders are made of thick boards that can handle quite a bit of load. The folders come in 5 colors, red, blue, green, orange, and yellow; 4 of each color. These folders are very bright, sure to get your attention in the file drawer. If you use hanging folders, then you probably just go to the office supply cabinet or store, and get standard green ones. These folders got me rethinking that practice. But looking at the folders that were in the drawer  previously, Ithrew them all away. But other than that, these are nice folders. These are very sturdy hanging folders, and I like that about them.Cons:1. I just have numerous folders that have just a few sheets of paper in them.2. I have used these folders before and I like them because they hold alot more than the typical hanging file. These folders are very colorful as well as sturdy. Otherwise, they're nice folders. These hanging folders are thoughtfully designed. The folders stay on the hanger fairly well but due have a slight tendency to come off, even though not as easily as regular ones do. These folders are strong and will hold more weight than lighter-weight folders.
