You open the stapler, place the staples, close and use.The difference is quality. It's a sharp looking stapler. This stapler, even though it's made in China, feels high quality. I don't think you could get a much better manual stapler. I started looking for a new stapler after I was given a vintage one that just was too small for my hands. This stapler is comfortable for me to use and looks pretty on my desk in my home office. Who cares it the RED stapler for God's sake. This is a good looking stapler and the bright red color makes it easy to find on my cluttered desk.The heavy weight of this stapler helps it to perform perfectly and it easily handled the eighteen page report I tested it on.Highly Recommended!CFH I had a cheap black stapler for years that doesn't staple very well, so I finally broke down and purchased this one. Get yourself a red stapler!!! Tested and tested this stapler and conclude this to be a well made quality product. I eventually replaced it with a staple-free stapler that works much better and reqires no refills. I love this stapler, plain and simple. The first red Swingline stapler made it's appearance in Mike Judge's movie Office Space. Best stapler on the market. This stapler works as well as it did 3 years ago with consistent use. It's a stapler. I just wanted a red stapler. I saw this stapler as a gold box deal awhile back and had to buy it for two reasons: I would at random times need a stapler and could never find one, and it makes my coworkers jealous.Honestly, when I first got it I figured I would only use it maybe a couple times a month but I've come to realize I need a stapler much more often. Not so with this amazing polished chrome stapler from Swingline. This is the famous Milton red stapler from the movie "Office space".This thing is built like a German tank. I got this stapler because of the movie Office Space. The stapler is made of metal(not plastic) and will last for along time. Get this stapler and watch the movie Office Space. I bought this stapler for nostalgic and practical reasons. C) This stapler can double as a weapon in a pinch. This stapler is more expensive than some, but it is so heavy-duty that I can see myself using it for years - if not forever. Still, as a stapler per se, it's a typical 5-star office stapler. about the red stapler. Whether due to the stapler itself or Swingline's premium-priced new staples, this thing cuts through a stack like it was butter, providing a reassuring "click" that lets you know no further pounding, effort, repeated attempts will be necessary. Did need a stapler though and this one is very nice and should last with my moderate use. Purchased this stapler for my office, as (like many other companies) was starting to mirror office space. Though not identical to Milton's stapler, this stapler is comfortable and works well if you're like me with oversized hands. The stapler made famous by its legacy on American desks and the movie Office Space is... dead.T
