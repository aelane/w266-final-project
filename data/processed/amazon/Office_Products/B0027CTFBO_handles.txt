Also, the handles feel sturdy and comfortable - not biting into your hands.Bottom Line:  Sturdy, easy to use, and you don't need tape. I liked the handles on the unit as it made carrying what would otherwise be an awkward size to handle. They also have handles which will fit a full adult hand. They are easy to carry and the handles are reinforced, which gives me peace of mind the entire box won't just collapse and fall to the floor. The handles and entire box are very sturdy.I like how easily they fold up for future use. Very sturdy, locking handles, and folds up to use again. The handles are a great help too. The handles on the side were very convenient and I love the way the boxes break down when storing for future use. The handles on the side are awesome, and make lifting the box a breeze. Because of this, and because the handles are so sturdy, it makes it easy and safe to carry, even if heavy.4) These boxes are easily stackable.Negative:1) These are not hermetically sealed boxes. The handles are strong and I have no worries about tearing handles and dropping heavy boxes on my toes. The handles are super comfortable and thick.
