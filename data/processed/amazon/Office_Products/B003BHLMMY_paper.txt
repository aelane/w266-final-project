The paper stock was stouter than others I have used. First, the paper is MUCH thicker (i.e. They're a nice heavy paper, almost cardstock, and have held up well to daily wear and tear. I liked that they weren't just standard paper but thicker, a heavier pound paper. The paper is thicker which is also nice (no bleed-through with sharpie pens). (Since this may depend on the paper you're sticking it on, I won't generalize this to every application.)2. The paper is much heavier and most of the note outside of the tab portion has the sticky glue, and because of that it stays in place better than your usual Post It. The paper is thicker than regular Post-It notes, and the adhesive comes out almost all the way to the tab, so these are sturdy and stay put. Both can be written on, but these heavy paper tabs are more suited to writing an entire note or comment in addition to the subject on the tab. The paper is thick enough to be used in serious legal documents. The paper weight is hefty so that you can easily pull on the tab many times without tearing or otherwise mutilating it.
