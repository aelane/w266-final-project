I bought this shredder to replace a more expensive model that died on me after a year of moderate use. I use my shredder to destroy junk mail and recycle as kitty litter.This shredder is a low-noise shredder that does a good job tackling credit cards and heavier materials. It's a perfect shredder for quick, daily use of old bills and correspondence.The plastic bin is OK, although it arrived disattached. This shredder is not too big, nor too small, and its rollers make it easily moved on a smooth surface.When Amazon offers this on sale for under sixty bucks, grab it! The shredder keeps paper dust and confetti from flying all over the place with a nicely sealed removable drawer. Emptying this shredder is way too easy.The idea of eight sheets of paper like most shredders - it is all about how you feed that paper. I never expected that the shredder would work that hard. I personally find this annoying enough that I would not recommend this shredder if your time and efficiency matter. I bought this to replace a Fellowes shredder that blew out a side after three years. This AmazonBasics shredder, thus far at least, does a really superb job of reducing sheets of paper to the size and consistency of fiber filling ... one could take the resulting product and use it to fill a cushion or for home insulation. This micro-cut shredder warms the cockles of my heart. This shredder can handle it all, so long as you don't feed too many sheets into it at once. My old shredder just wore out from years of use and it was somewhat alarming to see how much the prices have increased but coupled with more technical advances. The same is true with this shredder; however, I would hate to think of piecing together about 40,000 bits and pieces just to get a useless piece of paper. This is a great shredder and worth a check out. My old shredder would cut the CD in the same slot as paper and into tons of tiny pieces, however I like that it is separate on this machine to keep your paper cutting blades in top shape. This shredder is great to pop in junk mail without even opening. Very well made shredder that does exactly what it is designed to do. So first I should just say that I really like this shredder. The shredder piece itself (the top part) is heavy and solid. Good shredder for general use. A good basic micro-cut shredder. This shredder is smaller than my last one but I really like that you just slide the basket out to empty it, instead of lifting the heavy top off each time. This is much smaller than the shredder it is replacing.

The shredder was packaged very well, using pressed cardboard to secure the shredder in the shipping box.

The shredder makes confetti or little round circles out of paper and credit cards.
