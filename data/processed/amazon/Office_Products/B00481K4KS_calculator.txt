I like the Prizm FX-CG10 Color Graphing calculator because of its beautiful and high resolution color screen which permits graphing of functions using various colors. Though my calculator is not allowed in these classes it is allowed in my analysis classes which have equations consisting of 20+ variables. This is not a calculator for those of you who actually use math in a practical application. This is by far the nicest, coolest calculator. The calculator is very easy to use and understand. This allowed me to extract the calculator, the hard plastic faceplate (which can be installed as a backplate when the calculator is in use), a USB cable, a serial cable, a Utilities CD-ROM (Windows only), and the four AAA batteries necessary for operation. The calculator, received on 1/23/13, had version 1.0 of the software installed.Upgrading the software requires a PC (not a Mac, though it works fine with a PC emulator on the Mac, which is how I tested it). The calculator has about 9MB of free memory once the operating system and basic components are all installed.Upon initially turning on the calculator, you're faced with several color icons, as if you had opened up a folder on your computer. It's not entirely clear when turning on the calculator how you would quickly perform basic math. So far, the calculator is the best of all that we have in our family.The calculator has big and bright color screen, USB port to transfer date to any computer without use of special software. This is the most fairly priced calculator in this range that has ful and complete geometry software. I set the calculator on my desk overnight (without the cover on, shame on me) and in the morning found my 8-year-old had placed some diecast cars on and around it and there was a noticeable gouge on the screen. The calculator is easy to use and worked very well. The calculator comes with a very large feature set. There is a comparable TI calculator with a color screen (the Ti-Nspire) however it also has a bit of a learning curve since it completely departs from the traditional TI calculator series interface. This amazing calculator is strongly recommended for high school or college students who are taking math courses.
