I use these pens for both and love them. I love these pens! They erase well, and unlike the cheap erasable pens, these won't rip your paper when you erase. Besides that, these pens are AWESOME, and worth the money. It's not as smooth as some other pens I have used, but a general quality of a fine point pen is a tiny bit of scratchiness so it's par for the course, I guess.finally, and this can be a pro or con-the ink in these pens are completely heat sensitive. We love these pens! Gel pens are what I prefer but the non-erasing component doesn't allow much flexibility. This is one of my favorite pens. These pens are great. I am willing to bypass that, because these pens are great for making lists that change a lot, day planning, taking notes, and so much more. I have tried MANY erasable pens before, and the results were not satisfactory for me. These are great pens to write with on paper. Otherwise, these are the best erasable pens I have ever used! Guard your pens! these pens are awesome. These pens are perfect for my daily calendar, as I often have to erase mistakes or changes in my appointments. I personally wouldn't want to use these pens for lengthy writing tasks (e.g., taking notes or making long lists), but they have worked extremely well in keeping my calendar tidy and error-free.
