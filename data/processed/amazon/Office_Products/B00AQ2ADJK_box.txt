Every box I prepare for shipment will need a lot less tape when I use this. A box securely wrapped with this will not be able to be opened with anything other than a sharp object -no nosy college roommates (for example) tearing it open with their fingers. If you've ever had a box come open during mailing, you know you can't be too careful. (And if they really want in a box, this tape isn't going to stop them.)3. I didn't want to throw this box away because my novels fit perfectly inside it. With the Scotch Bi-Directional Filament Tape, I was able to tape the box back together. Recently I shipped a box across country using my regular old Scotch packing tape, and it arrived at the destination post office empty. The said box held up great and nerve once opened.I plan to use this tape for my outdoor wedding in late June. I am tempted to us a box cutter instead of the cutting edge on the tape gun.Overall, I am very happy with the tape and can live with the extra effort to cut it. If you actually loaded a box up with enough weight to really test the strength of this tape, the box would surely fall apart before the tape broke. It's like moving a box full of dumbbells, except that they're extremely expensive and, in some cases, irreplaceable. I reused an old Amazon box for the purpose. Normally, I wouldn't feel confident at all about the box opening up, despite wrapping the heck out of the thing.
