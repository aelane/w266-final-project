It's a full on shredder that works completely like a normal shredder. This is a compact shredder. This would be a great shredder for the home or small office and for small to medium jobs. We had a shredder in our house/office for years. This shredder not only does a great job in shredding sheets, about 8-10 at a time, but it does a great job of shredding CDs and credit cards. This shredder is a confetti cut, also known as cross-cut, and is the most popular type of paper shredder, because they offer a higher level of security. The shredder came well packaged. The shredder box and the DVD/CD receptacle were separate and easy to remove. A shredder lubricant sheet was enclosed, you feed this sheet directly into the shredder. Easy set up, plug the shredder into an outlet. To me, a shredder is the perfect solution.
