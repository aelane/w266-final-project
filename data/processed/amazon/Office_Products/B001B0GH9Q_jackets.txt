I love these jackets. These jackets are ideal as the media fits right into the pockets and will not slip out.Also, there are extra lecture notes which are loose at times and these are great. These jackets have a pocket on each side and a divider sheet inside. These jackets are made of a heavy mil plastic and seem to be sealed together for hard use.They are packaged in 5 different colors so you can keep your reports, documents, etc., better organized.Recommended for school or college students to hold notes, sales reps to organize client orders, and business folks keeping track of documentation or reports.Quality product. But I recently discovered these slash jackets and find that they help me resolve a number of organization issues.First, though they are designed to hold unpunched papers, I find that I can anchor my "go-to" memos (school schedule, "scan-a-score," yearbook staff contact info, etc.) So what can I say about these slash jackets that will be helpful to a potential buyer? What you may or may not know: the jackets are thick and sturdy, they're easy to grab and flip through, and they hold lots of different-sized papers, which if you're like me and have all sorts of papers and other miscellanea (index cards, pamphlets, yarn wrappers, fortune cookie, uh, fortunes, coupons, notebook paper, discs, receipts, crochet patterns, labels, cat toys, used tissues, snacks, etc., etc. The translucent jackets are handy especially for students who need to organize hand-outs from class. The jackets are sturdy and quite functional. With these plastic "jackets," I can slide the pages into them and then put the jackets into the binders. These "jackets" form a pocket with about one-third of the stored page still accessible. These jackets fit in the front of each of his folders to allow a quick place to put worksheets or other items that have not been hole punched. These are really sturdy and well made jackets that come in 5 colors.
