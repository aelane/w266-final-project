The pens lay down a good line and the eraser works really well -- in fact, you can write back over the part you've just erased without any blurring or darkening as is typical when using a pencil over an erased patch. These pens are of Japanese manufacture and appear very well made. Awesome pens and they really do erase!I hate pencils and this prevents me from having to use white out.Brilliant I found these pens to be comfortable to hold, write nicely and keep their color. These are the best pens! Most erasable pens do not erase neatly. The pens write a fine .7mm line. The pens are refillable. )These are really nice pens and I recommend them. I have other, cheaper erasable pens, but they just don't cut it compared to these.Now that I sound like the biggest, nerdiest fangirl on earth, let me step it up a notch. So, I was excited to try these pens. The only Frixion pens I have tried that didn't work too well was the fine point, and that was only because the ink seemed to dry up and they didn't last very long. I would definitely recommend these pens! )These pens differ from the original versions in that they are a pop-top - i.e. These are my favorite pens. These pens do just that. These are well made pens and function really well. They are great pens though! Seriously, Pilot could mark these pens up double or even triple, slap a new label on the package and market them to seamstresses/quilters and make a fortune . I love these pens. The pens open by sliding the clip. These pens are great. I was thoroughly impressed with how well these pens erase! I remember the old erasable pens from many years ago and they basically ripped the top surface of the paper off to erase. The Pilot FiXion pens are like regular ball-point pens except for the fact that they erase! These new friction-erasable pens are amazing.T
