You have to load the staples upside down. It means that I don't frequently get wonky staples in the paper. It uses the standard 1/4" staples. To replace your staples you simply slide out the bottom of the stapler.I think this would make a nice gift for a student or anyone who works in an office. It also takes full-sized staples but only half a sleeve at a time so if I don't break the staples exactly right I get a mess of smaller bunches. The staples magazine is well hidden in one of the arms. Standard staples can go in, and the stapler itself holds easily in a hand. I wasn't used to standard staples to be this thin and sharp, so I need to watch out a little. It used standard staples, but you can only load a half strip at a time. The staples are easy to load. The staples holder doesn't load a full set of regular staples.

I think it is slightly difficult to load and does not hold very many staples (1/2 a normal strip) at a time.

It is very simple to do, and staples that are still in there will not spill out if you do this correctly.

It's easy to replace your staples and it comes in 4 different colors.
