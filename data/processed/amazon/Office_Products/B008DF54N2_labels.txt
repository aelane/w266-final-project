What I wrote on the labels I made was clear.Honestly, I can't think of a really good use for this product. It's quite useful for temporary labels or markers, and it's easy to write on. I use these as labels for my binders, folders, and household objects that need to be labeled. I absolutely hate labels that leave behind sticky residue and I like that I can remove this label and use it back again. I can customize the labels for my specific information.Because the roll is sticky like a roll of tape (only of course not as sticky), the pieces adhere to whatever you stick them on. You use it like you would making labels with masking tape, but it's more attractive and easier to write on than masking tape and no residue when you remove it. Use it for labels, too. I wanted bright labels that would stay on well enough, but remove easily without leaving a residue.I tend to change out what I keep in my organizing bins every few years, and need labels that I don't have to cross out and write over, or break out the Goo-Gone to strip off.I also wanted something that I could remove from the wood paper laminate on my RV cabinets without ripping off the fake wood covering. These labels are great because you can "cut" them as long as you need and because they stick to every surface I've tried them on. This makes it useful for temporary labels on projects, kids' items, book covers, calendars, the refrigerator... Just don't use it on any delicate papers. Since you can cut the labels to the size you need, I can fit them on almost anything, as well as cut the tape to fit the length of my text. Put these labels on the papers they have to take to work or school and they won't leave them on the table, again. I have tried other removable labels that did not work as well and I love that I can make this the size I need.
