While the product description lists these as "labels", I find they work great for notes. BRILLIANT product!! Nice product! I'm going to review this product 2 ways, one being a nice way to use amazon, another reviewing this amazing product.Back when I first got started shopping on amazon, they didn't yet offer amazon prime, which lets you get free 2 day shipping on all items sold from amazon (not third parties), and to get free shipping (ground) you need to spend 25 dollars.So back then I used to buy some bookmarks or thrift store books (they run about 2-4 dollars, and are reprints of classics).But now that I have these labels, I will be recommending these as useful "additions" to the cart that you can add to make your order total up to 25 dollars.The labels themselves work as you would expect, they are high quality and terribly useful.The fact that you get 3 sets (different colors) further helps in organization.I like to color code the items that I organize.I have different journals laying around my room, and prior to these labels I would attach a post it note on the label so I could tell at a glance what the purpose was for the journal (business / self development, ideas) etc.Now, I can do this with ease with the label.The label's attach with ease and are so numerous I could never imagine running out for some time.The only "cons" I can think of are these:1. This product almost delivers on its promises:1. This product is good if you are a person like me who has way too much stuff and needs to label items to keep track of them. This product works as advertised. This product fills a different niche than the classic Post-It pad. )I'm using this product to tab and index music, WITHOUT removing the backing tab. Overall, I think this is a great product. Very handy product. Great product, they seem even more sticky then Post-it brand. I highly recommend this product. If so, you will love this product. Overall, a great product! I gave the product 3 stars, mostly for ingenuity. A great product!! An oddly useful product - stickers that really stick but that can be peeled off without any problem.These stickers are just the thing for manilla folders that will be re-used.

this product provides the flexibility to securely label an item yet not be committed for all of eternity to that container of #10 1 1/2 inch phillips screws.

And the product's flaws make it a questionable solution for things that you do use it for.These labels are fighting for space in the weakly adhesive note niche dominated by Post-It notes.

It's a solid product you should be able to rely on for ID type labeling and organizing.
