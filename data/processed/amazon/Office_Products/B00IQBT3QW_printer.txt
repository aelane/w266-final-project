I tried both and they were equally easy.The printer is quite heavy and solid. The printer complained about the photo paper being inappropriate, but it actually still printed the photo. This printer was fairly impressive. The printer spews out text and low-grade graphics documents (e.g. While the printer has the ability to produce double-sided documents, don't expect what you might get if you work for a FORTUNE 500 company, namely a printer that flips the paper automagically for you while printing. With this printer, you actually have to take the paper once the first side is printed and insert it back into the paper tray (with clear visual instructions from the software). It would be nice if the printer could connect to the wireless router like a laptop, phone or tablet does, but unfortunately the printer has to be plugged into the router, so that was a sad no go for me with my current home arrangement. The printer automatically connects to the PC as it detected and accesses my home WiFi network.I tried various files for my test printing, including photos, emails, documents, and PDFs, both color and black and white. The printer control utility on my PC allows one to keep tabs on ink levels, usage, and connectivity. But if I had to limit myself to one printer, this would probably not make the grade. If this was my only printer, I would look for a model that offers a more complete &#34;office like&#34; package. Amazingly, it picked up the printer easier than the laptop did. A good printer as a decent price. I was excited to evaluate this printer. shooting out of the printer with one to two lines of error messages. Finally, got fed up and turned the printer off. Then I turned the printer on to print some days later, the printer just continuing printing where it had left off with even more error messages. This printer can handle up to 20lb paper, but not photo-paper....not a negative, it is meant to be a workhorse for professional documents.Setup:  The hardest part of the entire setup was the unpacking, lifting, and placement....yep I am out of shape. :)  The printer does offer an ECO mode which uses less toner and offers draft quality printouts...this is sometimes useful and my tests the prints are sometimes good enough for reference copies etc....EXCELLENT.We like this printer as an addition to our home office - toner will be expensive to replace at $80 per color.... This is a very nice printer that has an incredibly quick and easy setup. They are expensive, as evidenced looking here at Amazon.Overall I've been using this printer for over a month and it works perfectly.
