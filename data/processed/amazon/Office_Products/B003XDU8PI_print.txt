It has three print settings for quality. Overall, it's just not user-friendly or intuitive.While it does have an internal print server page (just browse to the IP address of the printer), it is not interactive. I find it annoying that with every print, the Epson box pops up stating that it's printing and showing the ink levels.Photo Printing - 2 stars=========================Overall quality is average, however, poorer than my existing HP Photosmart Premium Fax all-in-one. I sent all of my routine print jobs to it for several weeks and had no problems. I was attempting to duplex print a a six-page flyer which had color from top to bottom on all six pages. The Epson print setup dialog offers and recommends adjustments you can make to control the ink saturation and drying time on duplex documents. Click print, few seconds later I hear the paper be picked up, and a split second later it's out on the tray.Size/Form Factor. I had to clean the print heads a couple of times at first (lots of ink wasted), but now it's fine.Buyer beware: there are no cheap 3rd party ink cartridges for this printer. The print quality is excellent and I appreciate the extra large size ink cartridges. The print is so dark and clear that it is laser quality. If massive print runs are on your horizon then the lack of the extra cartridge slot is important to take note of. Just hit print and the front side prints out fully then the paper is almost instantly sucked back in and the printer does the other side at equal speed.
