The sponge immediately showed wear from the hard rubbing, nd the white sponge started to separate from the blue spongeI read the reviews of others, and saw that it is not necessary to rub hard and that only a small amount of water should be used. :-(The white sponge turned dark in the area that I used to remove the ink. I rinsed out the entire sponge and put a little dishwashing soap on it to clear it and then run it out well. I will continue to use the same sponge very gently, I thought that it needed more pressure, which it did not.Not cheap at about $3.00 each, so I am anxious to see, with the proper use and care, how long it will last. So it does feel like you're holding a squishy sponge, not like a firm object. This little sponge works very well for the purpose of clean whiteboards.It can work either wet or dry. But it's still just a sponge. As directed, I wet the sponge and tried again. And it looks like a disposable sponge - doesn't seem to fit in in an office conference room. The dry sponge removed some of the marks, but not all. I dipped the sponge in water, squeezed most of it out and once applied found it did a great job of smearing dirty marker water around on the board. When the sponge is damp dry the erasing power is greater than when dry. This one is just a sponge. I wet the sponge to see if that helped and it did improve it quite a bit. The sponge has tackled all these jobs. I twisted and squeezed the sponge to wring it try, and that was a mistake.
