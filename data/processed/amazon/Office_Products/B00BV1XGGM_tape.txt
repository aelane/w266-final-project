What I like about this tape is that if you find yourself making an error when taping an item, you can simply lift it off and reposition the tape. The tape has sufficient stickiness over and over. This is as good a tape roll as any, probably better than most, therefore the word 'premium' in its name. The tape attached itself to the cardboard and I am confident that if the box itself broke apart it won't be because the tape didn't hold.To conclude: good quality tape, worked well with both glossy and 'rough' cardboard boxes. This tape is okay, but not great. This tape is a little stronger than the typical clear packing tape I use, and is just as easy to pull off the roll. While I wouldn't use this tape for everyday jobs, it is ideal for occasions where extra strength is needed. This tape is a bit thicker and adheres well. However, I have noticed that the tape with the reinforcing material could practically tow a car...it probably would with some meticulous wrapping.I say all of this only to offer a comparison to how good this tape is. This tape stayed in place much better. If I were to choose a tape it would indeed be this one. I give the tape 4 stars for it is indeed a quality product. And I have to admit, the tape pulls of the roll like silk and feels like suede when pressing it to the box, but I'm having a hard time justifying $8 a roll packing tape. I used this PSC50 packing tape to send 20lb boxes (large, flat rate USPS provided boxes). The tape stuck easily without lifting, and held the boxes together during transport. While this tape does rip off and stay on well, and seems to do its job, I do find it very expensive for one 60-yard roll. I was expecting this tape to be thicker and harder to slice off. This tape is strong and you cannot tear it with your fingers. If you don't like loud tape this would not be for you. I buy packing tape by the discount size and live with the low quality and lack of longevity. I used this tape to ship packages to Ukraine. Most tape seems to release during the shipping overseas. This tape held the package closed tight. This tape is as strong as the fiber tapes with none of the shipping problems. I really like this tape and recommend it for use in international shipping. This is nice tape and it works well, and for some things it may work better than others. I tested this tape with aScotch Box Sealing Tape Dispenser H122, 2 inbecause my old packing tape gun seems to have lost itself. This tape did pretty well. It's decent tape, but not worth $8 a roll. Mind you, Scotch is an excellent tape for the pack `n ship bit, but the IPG was different in one regard. I inevitably have to tussle with the tape to get one solid sheet all along the width without a torn section. If you are moving, this would be a perfect tape you use. For your average needs the Scotch is fine, but if you need tape that will really hold up, especially in an industrial setting, the IPG Corru-Grip is the clear winner. This tape is for moving. I really like this tape and will definitely purchase again. This tape adheres really well and is intended to be used for very challenging shipping circumstances or for over or under-filled boxes. It is easier to handle than the average packing tape. This is excellent tape, thick and sticky, much better than the conventional tape I buy 6 rolls to a package in bulk. Good tape, works as intended. I was happy to try this tape because we package our beef and the temperatures change dramatically. It's packing tape. I recently ran out of packing tape, so my boyfriend gave me a roll of sort of some generic multipack stuff he had lying around. Then I got this tape, so I decided I'd compare them to each other. The tape I usually use is Scotch heavy duty so I was glad I got to try this PSC50 tape.This tape is thinner than Scotch Heavy Duty. I use packing tape often in my business. I will admit this seems to be the strongest tape clear packaging tape I have ever used. I like to "over tape" my shipping boxes so if I were to use this tape the usual way I'd best spending an exorbitant amount of money. So, buy this tape with confidence, but use it sparingly and you may find the peace of mind is worth the expense. This tape holds well. This tape is pretty fantastic when it comes to performance; but not so much on cost. But this premium tape is definitely good to have on hand for those situations that call for extra durable and tough tape.Yup, it costs more, but cheaper brands just don't compare. But let me tell you that it's really good tape. I haven't had this tape split down the middle yet while trying to peel the starting point up. So, yeah, it's tape but it's great tape. The Duck Brand tape is 1.9 thousands of an inch thick as compare to this item's 3 thousandths, but I doubt there are many situations where that difference would matter.And just BTW: I have no idea why "Hot Melt" is in the name of this tape. It works as a tape should. I have never seen any tape do this. Good tape, seals well, kind of thick-feeling. It fit my hand-held tape dispenser just fine and neatly sealed all the cardboard packing boxes. At least cut the tape because I pulled the tape back off the box and it took a good layer of the box with it! This tape is ideal for sealing heavy, overstuffed, corrugated cardboard boxes, especially in hot or cold weather or when they will be subjected to rough handling. It is much more expensive than cheaper tape but is definitely inexpensive insurance for critical applications. As with other packing tape, it is pretty straight forward: It seals your boxes for shipping. This tape is thicker and stronger than others. This tape is thicker than any I have used in the past, and while it isn't for every situation, it is worth the expense when the shipment warrants extra care. I buy tape on a regular basis because I do a lot of shipping. The tape is very thin and seems rather generic. This tape came just in time for our move. I found this tape easy to use with my roller for tape and slides on easy. The PSC50 tape quickly grips cardboard, including the tricky kind, with a single strip and does not pull off. What can I say, it's packing tape. I did notice that this tape did not stick well on some of my boxes and came off. I used this tape to "reconstitute" some stored cardboard boxes, as I generally have some broken down and saved for when they are needed. The tape worked fine, appeared to be strong and heavy enough for that task, and readily adhered wherever applied.But it is sold without the inexpensive and necessary dispenser. It happens I had one that luckily fit and that I had luckily saved when its tape had been used. I feel confident using this tape. I have used this tape to secure large boxes of books and it works great. The tape is not overly thick and fairly easy to cut. A good tape for moving! The tape arrived without a plastic holder with cutter, but it fits perfectly into the red Scotch packaging tape holder for manual application. This tape is subjectively VERY DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED for those businesses that need extra heavy weight applications and which use 're-cycled corrugate' boxes, but it works superbly in my limited boxing and package sealing applications. This tape seems to stick equally well to the box and the old/previous tape. Though I haven't had this tape for decades, it does appear to be positioned to not have that failing. This is expensive tape, and I think for everyday jobs that are short-term and of lesser importance, any standard tape will do. This is as good as any average tape I've used. It's good tape. This seems to be really good tape, but it comes with a premium price tag. The tape seals very well, and it is thick enough that it doesn't annoyingly tear into shreds.I typically use Duck Brand packing tape, which I really think is sufficient for my needs. This tape isn't terrible, but it is also no better than the Scotch Heavy Duty Packing tape that they sell at Sam's Club, or the 8 packs of Duck Packing tape that you can get on Amazon. This tape is more expensive than both of those options, and is about equal in strength and performance to Duck, and is far inferior to the Scotch Heavy Duty.I would look elsewhere. While this packing tape from Intertape Polymer Group (IPG) is thicker and stronger than the usual tapes I use from Scotch or Duck Brands, they're also 2-3 times more expensive. This tape worked well. This tape worked well and I was confident the box would not break during transport.I received mine for free as a test product, so the price was not an issue. It does become very annoying to wrap and wrap cheap tape in layers around a box. My tape had streaks if you hold the tape up to the light but they aren't too visible once applied. This is fine packing tape that performs well however it's not that much better than cheaper alternatives so it may not represent a very good value compared to other available options. This is regular packing tape, a little thicker than the cheap versions of other brands but not any thicker than the Heavy Duty versions. I will continue to purchase my packing tape at the warehouse store for about a third the price.T
