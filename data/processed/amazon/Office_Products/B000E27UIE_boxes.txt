These boxes are made of some heavy duty cardboard. These boxes are an easy way to store everything! I can't complain about these boxes. The boxes come all flattened out and you have to assemble them. They're pretty roomy boxes, so I was able to fit a lot of books, but I can see that the bottom of these boxes are not going to stand being repeatedly lifted. If you're going to be moving these boxes around, be aware that, one of these days, the bottom is going to come loose, and your stuff will fall out. Three of the four boxes are storing stickers, letters (A,B,C types) and the like. Thank you kindly to Amazon for sending these boxes to start 2014, and being able to replace the more faulty boxes in which the hanging folders did not extend long enough to do what they do, which is hanging. These boxes for the intended purpose I use them for work very well, and deserve 4.5 Stars. I have found that with most of these boxes, the lid tends to be difficult to bend and fit into place and stay. These boxes shouldn't be complex to build in the first place and I find that added complexity generally takes away from the sturdiness of the box. These boxes should be designed to survive the long haul.Fortunately, this model of Bankers Box passes both tests. The boxes are easy to assemble and they are quite strong. It was easy to do, and even if I haven't assembled a million of these boxes before, the instructions for assembly are drawn right on the box. The boxes are sturdy and properly aligned. I like these boxes. These boxes are okay, but the bottom flaps mesh together in the middle; I recommend that you instead purchase the kind of box that has flaps that extend all the way across the bottom of the box. There are other Bankers Boxes that do this as well as generic boxes. Way back in the early 1970s, these were called &#34;R-kive&#34; boxes.
