The color scan quality is very poor, especially if the item is a few millimeters off the surface. Here's why:- The color print quality is horrible. The color was pretty washed out on the first few pages, but quickly improved to an excellent and accurate representation of the screen version. So, if you run out of one color, you would have to discard the whole ink cartridge and replace it with a new one. Granted, I haven't had a color printer myself in six years, but my wife uses a three-year-old HP All-in-One, and I have to say that the Kodak stomps in in terms of color quality on plain paper. It doesn't matter that you're not printing in color; It flat-out refuses to work at all if BOTH cartridges aren't present and have at least a little ink in them.I think this is a cruddy way to do business. Without replacing color, too, I'm unable to get anything done at all.Kodak: You can release a firmware update that eliminates this boorish behavior by the printer. if you want to print black and white and you are out of color ink, it won't work). Also if one color of the color (that have 5 base colors) ink cartridges is empty, the entire color cartridge need to be replaced (since all color inks are integrated into one color cartridge). Good color quality print out (photos)5. If one color of the color ink cartridges is empty, need to change the entire color cartridge (wasting ink)3.
