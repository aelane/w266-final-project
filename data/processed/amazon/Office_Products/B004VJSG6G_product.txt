This product has been of good use to me since I often write list out for all my shopping needs. I really like this product and highly recommend it! A very handy product. This is a solid multi-purpose Sticky Note product. I definitely think this product is a "must have" for your home, office or school. The product pretty much does what it is advertised to do, but I am just not finding the feature that useful. Overall, a good product for the way I use them. Although it may seem like this product is a waste of paper since you're tearing and leaving the adhesive portion behind, the pad has come quite in handy. This is a nice product for making short, quick notes anywhere and I recommend it to those who may be interested. Then I realized I was over-complicating this Avery product; it sticks OR it perforates.
