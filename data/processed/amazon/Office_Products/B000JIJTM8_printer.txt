It should hold a printer and some supplies but you can't really place too much weight on the paper-thin sheet-metal shelf or it buckles as it did when I touched it with my hand. This is a great little printer stand. I use it with my printer on top, paper on the top shelf, and files under that, and it has freed up some good real estate on my desk. I was balancing my printer on a 2-drawer file cabinet. My printer fit perfectly on top.If it wasn't for the instructions it would have been a five star review. This seems to be a very sturdy printer stand. Since the printer is supposed to be set on top of the cart, there are no holes in the back metal plate for electrical wires to go through.... this is fine with me and not an issue. This printer stand is sturdy, sleek and simple. For now, I put a small printer and stocked some reams of papers under, and it looks pretty nice and organized.The size of this table is not small (about 26 inches wide) at all. I really like this printer stand and am actually using it as a desk. If you need a small mobile printer stand, you might want to consider this. The Scoot Desk-Side Printer Stand is a really great looking printer stand.

This particular printer stand seems robust, with two shelves to hold paper and a small basket on the side for print outs.

This would be an okay printer stand if it used different screws because tightening Phillips head screws going into wood in tight corners with a screwdriver is as close to 'mission impossible' as they come.
