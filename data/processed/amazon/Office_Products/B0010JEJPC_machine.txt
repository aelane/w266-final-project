What a dandy little machine for the price. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this machine works excellently! The machine jammed and the release did not free it. I'm using the Scotch machine with the Scotch sheets - a perfect combination. This is a great little laminating machine. The machine was always broken and was hardly ever used due to all the issues. I love this machine so much I bought it for every teacher friend I had along with all of the preschool teachers I used to consult to and for at least 4 of my friends. I would highly recommend this machine who does laminating The machine gets hot and if left on for a long time might not be good as most of the parts are made of plastic.There are only 2 parts. The machine itself and the top loader tray.

The Fellows machine was slightly slower than the Scotch machine, but not by more than a few seconds for a full sheet pass.Both units advertise that they operate up to 5 mil, as I only had 3 mil pouches to play with, I can not comment on effectiveness with thicker pouches.

This will jam the machine and won't get the item laminated!Overall, it's a great item for under twenty dollars, and the only real costs are in the laminating pouches so shop around and get the best deal.

This machine is FAST and QUIET!I laminated about 80 other items and everything I could get my hands on except the cat, and didn't have a single problem and they all came out perfect.
