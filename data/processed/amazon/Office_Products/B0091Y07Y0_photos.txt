I probably printed 15-20 photos in all and a few documents, and cleaned the printhead twice, and the graphic showed that the tanks were half-empty. I was shocked, but the Pixma's photos were washed out, not sharp, and lacked depth compared to the very vibrant photos that came from the Expression. The printing itself is stunning,especially the photos. I had all but given up printing my photos at home and now,  I will be able to do so. It takes longer to print photos than draft-quality text, as you might expect.TWO PAPER TRAYS:  There are two paper trays, one for "regular" paper and one for specially-sized items like envelopes and photo paper. If it's photos and graphics that you're printing, and not a lot of lengthy documents. I printed two different photos, a 4x6 family photo, and an 8x10 wildlife photo. On the 4x6 photos, the print was slightly, Slightly sharper with the Artisan. After printing over 50+ photos (up to 8.5x11 in some cases) I am sold on it's photo printing capabilities.What I'm not too wild about is its regular printing capabilities. This photos are crystal clear and does not fade after printing. The photos you get are as close to professional without having to pay for a more expensive photo printer.As for the printer itself, it is a great compact size, considering you have an inkjet printer, flatbed scanner, copier, 2 sided duplex printing which also prints from an iPad, iPhone, tablet or smartphone and with your 2.5 inch LCD panel, you have the ability to do quite a bit of photo correction above and beyond red eye before printing. You may not be getting professional photos with 6 inks, but you are getting close to pro photos with the 5 richly colored inkjet inks and highly detailed scans that will give you gorgeous sharply detailed documents and photos and for that, the Epson XP 600 deserves 4 1/2 Stars. As I noted when I reviewed it, the Officejet 100 does surprisingly well with photos, although by default it prints them a bit light.
