I have always used Avery 5160's for all my address label needs for the past 15 years but really liked these labels. They work as well as any address labels I've used. 3M address labels are a decent product. When you print a LOT of address or other labels, this is incredibly important - especially with mailing lists for organizations where a jam could mean a lot of time in finding where the jam occurred, which labels didn't get printed and then finding this in your program and restarting it from where it left off.Nicer labels than others I've used!Great for schools, organizations, businesses and others who need to user labels for mailing, medicines, kid's items, supplies, and so on... Also great for getting organized or labeling things around the house for the little ones to learn to read. Great address labels you can print on. I used a few to hand-write an address, and they worked just fine. They are permanent address labels and fed smoothly & printed perfectly in my laser color printer. These 3M 3100-A permanent adhesive address labels works as expected, very well. I got these address labels to use for Christmas cards. The address labels are made of a bright white paper material that is dense enough that when I used an Inkjet printer to print the labels the ink did not bleed through the label. I've made my own address labels before and they turned out great, only issue was the label sheets would sometimes (1 out of 5 or so) would get jammed in my laser jet printer. 3M has made sure that their permanent adhesive address labels are indeed permanent. these are perfect for printing your own address labels. Don't let the address labels name fool you. Great address labels. These address labels are extremely sticky so one would be well advised to be precise about where one applies them! These address labels are really great. These address labels come in your standard package which includes 750 individual labels or 30 sheets. They are sized so that they may be used both as address labels or large return address labels. I suppose they would even work as address labels for envelopes.Looking at them on the website I thought they would be pretty specific in use, but I've found all kinds of uses. These adhesive address labels do a good job of being adhesive address labels.
