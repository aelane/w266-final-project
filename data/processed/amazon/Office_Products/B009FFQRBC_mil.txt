The 3 mil pouches are nice...they don't make your documents to stiff and consequently hard and warped. I used it with 5 mil laminating pouches that I purchased here at Amazon http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LQWWFS/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1Make sure you buy these or other sizes from Amazon because the name brand ones that you might see at your local office supply store are ridiculously expensive (3-4x as much).The laminator heats up in about a minute and then it is ready to go. It will utilize either 3 or 5 mil laminating pouches. The 5 and 7 mil sheets should work without any issues. I realized that you want to get the higher "mil" laminating sheets as they are harder plastic and lasts longer. If you're only using a 3 mil pouch, why wait the extra time? It accepts 3 mil and 5 mil laminating pouches, which are NOT included. Switching between 3 and 5 mil is as simple as flipping a switch. You can run either 3 mil or 5 mil pouches through it. Swingline makes a basic Ultra Clear Pouch for 3, 5, 7 and 10 mil thickness. They also make LongLife Pouches in 5 or 10 mil. Beware it only supports 3 mil thickness protector sheets unless you are doing small items (4x6 or smaller) which allows it to handle the thicker 5 mil sheets.So this is not going to be great for a someone who plans on using it everyday but instead makes an excellent addition to the office for the light use.
