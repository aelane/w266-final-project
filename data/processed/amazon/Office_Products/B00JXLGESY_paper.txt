Setup was easy, load the paper, load the ink and turn it on. you can specify what paper is in each tray (bottom tray prompts when you enter it, but the top tray did not). However,  it is quite a-bit higher as it does hold so much more paper stock, and probably needs more inside space for the much improved mechanics.
