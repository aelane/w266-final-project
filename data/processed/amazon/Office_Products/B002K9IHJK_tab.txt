There is a small tear tab at the bottom which is perforated. So if you want to remove it easily later, you leave on the tear tab. If not, you remove the tear tab and you have a great way to mark all kinds of things.This is really great for people who might be canning their own food, or doing other activities that result in having several identical containers.Its best for semipermanent use. They have a non-sticky perforated tab down one side, allowing for easy separation and peel-off. They have adhesive all over the back except for a little tab on the edge that gives you a nice little edge to grab to remove them from the pack that they come in and to remove from your container when you're through using it. They add a little perforated tab without the sticky for handling that you can remove to avoid getting that edge of the label snagged on something. The tab allows you to separate the top label from the stack. Apply, tear off the tab, and you now have no loose ends hanging out to cause inadvertant pulling off (as the original labels are prone to).2. There is a tab on one end which does not have a sticky back. I like that they have a non-stick tab on the edge that is perforated for easy removal. When I removed the tab and re-applied, that is when the corner that I was scratching at to lift in the first place began to deteriorate.Highly recommend to everyone for their use and practicality in many types of situations.
