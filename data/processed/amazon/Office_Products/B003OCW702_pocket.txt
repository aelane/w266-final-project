Yes, it's just open and the pocket just sort of hangs there. Well, it seems that I'm not too impressed by these pocket pages (the tab label on the side works fine though! Much like the pocket pages, they are open on the left side! Unlike the pocket pages, though, being open on the left side doesn't hurt it too much since you'd only ever put two pages at most into a page protector. Not to mention making proper pocket pages and page protectors. We use theseparate pocket dividers for storing receipts in different categories and as an ongoing project book like vacationand travel ideas.My wife uses one for organizing and storing recipes both hand written family recipes and ones torn frommagazines. He really likes the pocket on the front where he can put one of his drawings. Is it a pocket folder? It has an easy to reach pocket folder in the front that makes it simple to slip papers and notes into and since it's enclosed on 3 sides, they won't fall out as easily. They also have a smaller closed pocket with a plastic latch.

There are also 2 pocket dividers and they have little pockets on those pockets that you can slip business cards/money/maybe a thumbdrive?.

Unfortunately, these pocket pages are nearly useless for anything more than 2-3 sheets of paper.

Well, the pocket's left edge isn't secured to anything.
