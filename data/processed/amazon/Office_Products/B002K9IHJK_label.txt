It works as it is supposed to: it creates a label or writing surface you can stick to things. However, when you try to tear it off (after you stick the label on) it's not so easy to get the clean tear they are going for. Up the label came and a new label put on. I like that though since I can find and read the label well. These Post-It label pads are really nice. A (good) ordinary label sticks forever. I guess if you want a "removeable" label they are easily removeable and will meet your needs. The label is more easily removed if you leave the strip on and less easily removed if you take it off! We've been looking for a larger removable label that stays on a book in order to provide more information to the customer than the pricing labels we use. Each label peels from a pad and sticks very well to many surfaces. The label retained all it's sticknessSurface 3:  Glass on Picture frame (success) - extremely sticky on the smooth, clean glass surface. When removing the label, it started to curl. The label is amazing.Surface 7:  Textured Guitar case (success) - Back to the challenging surface with dust/dirt from a Martin guitar case. Despite lifting the label and any curl, this does not appear to affect it's integrity. So now I can easily make a label for food items, for example, put the date when I open a package, or repack something from a big bag to smaller containers. However, it should be just a little easier to tear without wrinkling the label. It saves the ugly, messy build up of label on top of label on top of label. They would be fine where you need a somewhat temporary label which can be easily removed later, but don't mark your boxes or containers for long term storage and expect them to be nicely labeled years later. Generally, the label will peel off after a month or two.Since it isn't yet time to pack up for Christmas, I made four "test" labels using my new post-it "super sticky" labels and attached them to four different rubbermaid containers. Yet, it's not like a label which damages the surface it's pulled off of, or leaves sticky residue. And also be "Labels", just as the label says. Just stick your label on your item and tear off the tab. However these Removable label pads by Post-it are a marriage of these two popular items; a marriage that looks like a success.There isn't much to say about a sticky note, so I'll be brief, but thorough.1) These notes have sticky tape/glue on the entire backside, except for a small strip of bare paper which can be removed if desires (it's perforatted).2) These notes successfully stick to any surface - paper, cardboard, plastic, my shirt. The label colors provide enough contrast for easy reading. For an adhesive label, I would expect this not to happen, however it does make removing and re-sticking the labels a simple task. If you need a removable reusable label, give these a try.PROS:Removable and reusableColors provide contrast for easy readingSimilar to a standard Post-it with more sticky stuffCONS:Label tends to curl up slightly on one side After all, the label worked on a tin foil lid that came straight from the freezer, but is not adhering to a plastic container...a more normal use for them. They are bright and you can see the label at a distance. It's hard to dislike these functional label pads that combine the features of a post-it note with a box lable. I use these to label binders, shelves, and tons of other things in my classroom. These bright label stickers will solve that problems for me forever now. Normally I would have to use a label maker or tape a note onto something. Then when you place the label where you want it the non-adhesive end can be pulled right off so you have full adhesion.They're great for binder, boxes, food containers - whatever you want a full label on, with nice bright color too! Write on the label--bright neon, so you can find it on the box more easily--and stick the label on the box. The whole label is sticky (as opposed to regular postits, with only a strip of adhesive). Full adhesive label, sticks securely, and removes cleanly. This keeps the label fully adhered and does not "flap". The label though (worth mentioning) is sticking to my shirt rather snugly with the exception of the corners.

I can now use them and know they will stay put since the whole label is 'sticky.'

I love these label pads.I'm in the middle of getting a move together and find these little pads quite the handy helper.

The label shows these sticking to plastic bins.
