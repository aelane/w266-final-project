These pens are great, awesome to have at the start of school, I will not have to buy any more this yr and maybe next yr!! Highly recommend these pens These pens are inexpensive, they work on the first try, and you can afford it if a numbskull walks off with one (or more) of them. I place several pens in strategic locations in my apartment just for her to find sometime to either carry off or bat to the floor. These pens by Bic are very good although sometimes when a pen is first used I have to scribble a tiny bit on scrap paper to make the ink come out so I can write! Nevertheless, these pens last me as long as they ever did. The pens are made of plastic with a see through ink tube inside them. If you want inexpensive pens that still give you good quality ink, you really can't go wrong with these pens by Bic. They aren't the greatest pens in the world but there's something to be said about having a million of them and only spending about six bucks. We go through pens at work faster than we go through water, people (including myself) constantly misplace them, or clients take them so we need a bulk amount of black pens to just grab from on the go. They are your standard Bic pens and they write really well and smoothly. don't get me wrong, these pens serves their purpose.
