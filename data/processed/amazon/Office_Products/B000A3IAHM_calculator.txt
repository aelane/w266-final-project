This calculator was recommended to me by an engineer whose desk was next to mine. I bought this calculator in 9th grade for Geometry and it wasn't really a huge help. This Casio FX-115ES calculator came highly recommended by my son's geometry teacher and it has proven to be a good choice. The calculator has an intuitive layout that makes accessing functions very easy and the 2-line display is convenient for entering long equations and reading the solutions.This is a very powerful calculator and is also a fairly good value!Highly Recommended!CFH To turn ON the calculator, you must press a special ON button. I instinctively hit AC to try to turn on the calculator since my old Casio scientifics all turned on in this manner. The Casio also takes getting used to for TI graphing calculator users. I love using this calculator. This calculator is excellent, you can easily enter in fractions and decimals and along with all the basic stuff. Also, this calculator can give you the coordinates for any equation.Example:Input: f(X) = 5x^2 + 2Options: Start a -2, end at 2, steps of 1Output: (-2,22), (-1,7), (0,2), (1,7), (2,22)Bonus points for being able to having the option of a entering in 3 numbers and having the calculator output a solved quadratic. (The calculator solves the quadratic formula for you) One of the (very) few problem is that this calculator had a bit of a learning curve. This calculator is good to the point where its banned from certain Algebra tests. But honestly, you probably don't really need this calculator until Algebra 2-ish. I was able to use this calculator's fractions feature without even opening the manual.I opened up the calculator and took out the single button cell (battery) and covered up the solar panel and the calculator was out cold.
