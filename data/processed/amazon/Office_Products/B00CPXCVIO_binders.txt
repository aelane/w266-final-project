Opening binders can be challenging for little fingers but this one opens smoothly at the press of a single button. I feel like these Wilson Jones binders are constructed well enough that they would likely not fall apart with normal wear. Still, I prefer smaller binders in attractive colors, both qualities which are getting harder and harder to find in stores.I admit that I was attracted to this binder because it is green, my favorite color. As binders go, I expect this one to hold up to general office use. There are better binders out there. )Overall, this is one of the best binders I've seen. If I were shopping for binders, I'd probably buy a few of these to compare to the less expensive ones to see if the claims of greater durability are true. I generally don't like binders. Different binders are best for different purposes, so I will try to give a good idea of how this Wilson Ultra Duty one works.The cover material of this binder is a tough, but somewhat cheap looking plastic. Most of my binders are black or white and it takes me a few minutes to find what I am looking for. I like to use binders like this to store recipes I have printed out and placed in plastic sleeves. I've bought quite a few binders in my time.

Much improved over all other binders I've used.Second this binder has higher pockets and the pockets are see-through.

I've tried a few of these Wilson Jones binders, and this is one of the more basic ones.

I tend to think the Wilson Jones binders are overpriced, but if you can find a good price on them I do think they are a solid and sturdy choice if maybe binders falling apart on you are a problem you've had in the past.
