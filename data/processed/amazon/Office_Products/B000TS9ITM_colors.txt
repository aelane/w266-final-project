The colors add both fun and practicality to the chore. The colors are also pretty cool.Very useful folders. I especially love the nice colors and the ability to handwrite on the tabs! The colors only add to the organization capabilities. They come in assorted colors. Love the colors in the assortment. I also love the colors of these tabs. Assorted colors definitely make it easier to spot from distance without the need for reading labels each time and are time saving. The very bright red, blue and green colors have a one-third size tab, which is easily written on, or used with stick-on file labels.

The colors are not the florescent colors shown in the product picture, but basic flat colors.

Love the colors and love the new style of these.

They come in assorted colors or plain.The best part of these folders is you can write directly on to the tabs.
