As advertised, this pen can write in any of four ink colors: Black, blue, red, and green. And, while this pen is nowhere near as nice as myCross Tech 4, it still works well; writes well, and looks decent in the bargain.The ink cartridges supplied all write smoothly with nice, vibrant colors. For a multi-color/point pen this is and odd mix. Fun.This pen, although not perfect, is quite fun. Obviously, it's bigger than a "normal" pen, but it's not so big that it's a pain to hold, and I like the rubber grip. The pen comes apart easily, and the cartridges seem full of ink, so hopefully they'll last a long time. This pen is a combination of four colored inks (with fine-point writing tips) plus a mechanical pencil and eraser.As with ink-jet printers, I'll likely run through some ink colors faster than others, but they're apparently refillable (I couldn't locate refills but maybe it's because the product is new?) and the pen's casing seems durable for refillable use. It's an attractive, good-quality pen. Great multi-ink pen, it writes smoothly and doesn't stick when you have to switch between colors. The pen houses black, blue, green and red ink alternatives. I like this pen. I love this pen. I got this to contrast with the old-school Bic 4-color pen that I used as a kid in school, decades ago, which is still available today. Till then, I will be enjoying this 4+1 pen! I was very disappointed when I thought this pen was broken right out of the package until I understood the rings. The pen is large, but it fits easily in your hand. This is a great little pen that combines four different ink colors plus a pencil all in one writing implement. My pen DID come with lead pre-loaded, so I have this to look forward to (I'll have to get some .5mm lead refills. The pen has a comfortable grip and nice weight and balance. This pen is ergonomic and has 4 color retractable ball points, a pencil and eraser. Gripping the pen is very comfortable considering the size. Overall, it is a good pen of this kind. This pen's lead is only 0.5mm. The pen is plain, though, and I really wanted to customize it! Also, the pen is slightly wider than I usually like to have them and the ink not as fine a point as I'm used to; you can also get 4 pens and a mechanical pencil separately for less than the cost of this.
