DBRoth sent me this scanner in exchange for an honest review, so here goes:GENERAL INFO:The scanner allows for the scanning of negative film (color and b&w;) as well as positive or slide film (color). It performs pretty well, but some may find it not up to par.- As far as I can tell, the scanner does not scan the full 35mm frame, but cuts off a mm or two. This DB-Tech "scanner" is a relatively painless way to convert the old formats into digital files that can then be cleaned up, if desired, with post-photography software.The process is quick, although not entirely intuitive. )The scanner is small and lightweight. So I'm using the DB-Tech scanner to scan the slides that I really want into digital.I was impressed with the performance of the little scanner. The scanner did a nice job on them. Overall, I'm very pleased with the DB-Tech scanner. I was really surprised at how easy this scanner was to operate. When the scanner is turned on, you can see the negatives move into place so that you get it aligned correctly. The scanner automatically adjusts the picture brightness levels (sometimes to a fault). But then, this scanner doesn't cost $1,000-2,000, either. But the scanner will overcompensate when digitizing night shots, like fireworks, or shots with a lot of shadow. This negative and slide scanner is so easy to operate that even those of us who are old enough to have stacks of old slides and negatives can easily use this little device. The scanner is a compact little machine that you can connect to your computer, PC or Mac or if you prefer, you can plug it into the wall with a USB converter and use it away from the computer. We could just as easily have connected the scanner to the computer. You can also connect the scanner to your TV to see your saved images on the big screen. )The scanner comes with an AC wall plug power supply, a USB cable to connect it to your computer or the wall, a cable to connect it to your TV.
