All in all these are a quality product & Avery makes it easy to dress them up on your own or with their own tools. They are good quality, and I think makes a statement about your business when you design them in a professional style. These are very good quality tickets and would work well for any organization. Nice quality. Avery has quality products. These are good quality tickets with fine perforations for separating each ticket and coarser perforations for the stubs. I think it is typical Avery quality, which is to say first-class. You won't be disappointed as these have higher quality than the average labels. They do not come out looking like professional quality, but they should be fine depending on the formality of your event.
