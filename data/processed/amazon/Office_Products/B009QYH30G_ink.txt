That makes me think its not the ink...that its the ball point of the pen itself. The ink seems to look like ballpoint ink...well, whatever it WAS dryer thanthe typical gel ink is right out of the pen, and that is nice. The ink cartridge can be refilled when you run of nick.They glide along the page so you don't have to push down hard on the paper.I love the spongy part grasp area. The special ink looks nice on paper, which actually makes my lousy handwriting a little more presentable. I alwasy found those smooth to write with and a great ink darkness. They are the dark black ink that I love with the smoothness of a G2 minus the smearing! These black ink pens are terrific: fine point, smooth but not runny. They write so smoothly, the ink is consistent throughout all writings. If I tried really hard, I was able to smear the ink a little bit, but I had to do it very immediately after the ink hit the paper. They write beautifully and the ink does not smear without some effort. They all use black ink.
