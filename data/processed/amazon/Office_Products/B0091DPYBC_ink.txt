I'm not as concerned about the ink because I can now refill the ink cartridges at Costco for less than a new OEM cartridge. When the ink has been sitting awhile without printing, the heavier color molecules settle at the bottom & interfere with printing. *bad*~ The ink ran out VERY quickly. Since the ink is what gets a person in the end, I have to say that the ink prices are comparable and not outrageous like HP printers.2. I can't stand paying 50-90 USD for ink. Open the top to put the ink in and it felt like if I was not careful, I could rip the scanner right off the printer. The ink on the photos takes forever to dry. Also the ink is expensive. The ink was dry when it came out, and it looked almost perfect. Aside from free ink, what more can you ask for? The ink is always out so printing was an issue. The ink ran out in less than a month (of occasional use) and I never could get the Wifi to work so, when I saw this scanner, I thought GREAT. Individual ink cartridges, you only replace the one that's empty. And the ink is still cheaper, although only by $20.00 in most places, and so far, with light use, I have only run out the black. The ink cartridges do go quickly; that fact is what lost this product one star in my rating. After using the Epson I found that it is a good ink jet printer. The small ink cartridges don't last long and are a little pricy to purchase. It is probably to keep the ink wells from drying out.
