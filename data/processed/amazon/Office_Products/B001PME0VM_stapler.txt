Great stapler The stapler can be set to staple pages manually, instead of stapling automatically (as soon as the paper is inserted.) I thought I was happy with my old Swingline stapler, but this one is amazing. The stapler is larger than most and those lights are bright, but my smaller stapler sometimes requires me to staple several times before it works. My old stapler is going to be retired. I have used the Swingline Optima stapler since October and just started having trouble last week. For a stapler that is suppose to be jam free, it doesn't live up to its guarantee. This is a really great stapler -- works perfectly and is durable. This stapler can attach where my mechanical one could not, so the binder clips can be saved for other uses.This stapler is larger and heavier than most and it does take up more desk space. I have never put this stapler to the test by attempting to staple 45 sheets, but I have used upward of 30 with satisfactory results. First off, the stapler has a huge footprint that will look hideous on a small desk so this is best left to a dedicated counter or on top of a file cabinet. I have a manual stapler of theirs that I got back in the 60's that still works great. The stapler has a manual mode too; in the manual mode you put the paper in and touch it lightly on the top; you don't have to exert any pressure. Fabulous electric stapler. I must begin by saying I personally do not find this to be a bad stapler, when all the basics are considered. It's a sturdy stapler that won't get jostled about unduly, and the stapling occurs quickly. Annoying, though less apt to happen if this stapler is reserved for special projects.Again, I just prefer a manual stapler for my heavy-duty projects and this electric one does not seem up to heavy-duty long shifts. They are really not that much more expensive, and if you use them, then I think you&#8217;ll find that this stapler works just fine. This is one BIG stapler ...weighing almost 3 pounds, about 10&#34; in length, 3.5 in width and 5+&#34; high. I have another electric stapler that has always performed reliably - but, I have traded it in for using this one full-time because of it's ergonomic, user friendly designer. The Swingline Optima 45 is an electric stapler suitable for a school or office environment. Because it is an electric stapler, it seems like it could be about half the depth. I am so happy to archive my old personal stapler for an office model. It's a no-hands stapler. This stapler does what it proclaims to do (staple 45 pages at a time), and does it well. This is a very BIG stapler. The stapler isn't super "fast" but staples at a reasonable enough speed for me to keep up. This stapler is designed to take about 40 pieces of 20# paper, and I gave it a shot at a report that was in the 45-50 page range. This stapler made it easy and effortless. For now it is a solid four stapler, leaning towards a five. I knew I was getting a stapler. My new Swingline stapler sits on my desk, with its two LEDs glowing, like a cat waiting for a mouse to come near. This stapler has been able to handle anything I've attempted to staple (20 lb paper, thicker stock, multiple sheets) without jamming so far. It does make the stapler feel and look cheesy. If you have a regular electric stapler, you know how loud it is. As compared to my regular electric stapler that used to make the cat jump 20 feet away. I got this stapler to replace our office Swingline 270 stapler-- a big square thing looking like it came from the 50's. I just thought an electric stapler sounded cool, so I got one. If you think you might benefit from an electric stapler, then this one works. If you even have to question whether this might be useful, then skip it and buy a conventional stapler. I have been using this stapler with Optima staples.

This is the first electric stapler that I've personally owned, but before I retired, I used them hundreds of times in the office, so I have some idea what I want in one.

I knew this was a stapler with a high capacity, but when it arrived, I realized that this would have no home on my desk.

The Swingline Optima 45 Electric Stapler was just what I was looking for!This stapler has a streamlined design and an orange LED light on the front.
