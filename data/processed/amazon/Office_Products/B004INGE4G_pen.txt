However, it is the same pen under the skin. The pen has been holding up very well through the years. Yes, it makes a great and convenient editing pen (red ink), and I'm sure there are other legit uses for it as well.But for me, and I'm sure for more than a few others (like my wife and kids who kept snaking it from me once they discovered its greatness) it's just about having a great pen that makes me smile every time I pick it up.Without question, worth the money. I usually hold a normal black pen with a highlighter in the same hand and switch, but now I usually skip the highlighter and use this Bic pen. All in all, a great pen, but once the ink runs out, I will be searching around for a more slender pen. I received the BIC retractable 4-color soft-grip pen to use and review as a Vine reviewer.I really like this pen. This pen has some girth and is very easy for me to write with. I liked this pen, alot, at least for the few minutes I had it in my possession. Who doesn't love a pen that has black tie formal ink, blue everyday ink, red correct mistakes grading teacher ink, and fun time green ink? If you're looking for a multi-color pen, this is a great one. The 4-color pen is nothing new, and the way this pen write is nothing great. Really, if you're looking for a 4-color pen, there's nothing negative here. Great pen! I love it- I love that I can carry one pen and have 3 colors. Best of all, the pen is now all black leaving that geek factor behind. Having a Bic-brand colored pen means a replacement guarantee and the possibility however remote of buying refill ink at multiple locations. The latest "Soft Grip" pen from BIC provides a 1 mm medium point refillable pen that will be handy and useful on any desk. I have used many pen such as this over the years, but this seems to work the best ! It represents all I expect in a pen. This pen writes well, changes to different colors well. Other than that, it seems to be the same pen. I'm still not sure why they have a green pen but that doesn't really bother me; I just don't use it. And, if you've never owned a Bic 4-color pen before, get it. It was a neat pen and I used it quite a bit - until it broke. That pen was not the most durable of writing tools and I was disappointed when it failed me. It does make holding the pen a little nicer but it's not going to prevent cramping if using the pen for a while.This is a worthwhile redesign of an old classic, and the price point is very reasonable. It's a comfortable pen...not too big, despite containing four separate ink cartridges.If you're like me, and loved the old version of this pen, I think you'll find this to be a good improvement. And, if you've never owned a Bic 4-color pen before, get it. This is the pen to beat all other pens, not only is the grip fantastic on this pen but it writes like a dream. It is constructed more solidly, and otherwise is an all around better pen. I would recommend it if you are looking for a nice pen that has different colors. This is a nice pen that works great. I gave this pen to my home-schooled five-year old and he absolutely loves it. This is a GREAT pen and a good deal for nursing students and nurses. Ink runs smooth and flows easy.A great pen, and I'm glad it's back. However, I keep this pen with my hiking and backpacking gear to use for note taking while on the trail or camping. I use this pen with aRite in the Rain Tactical Pocket Notebook - Desert Tan. Well, it's difficult to review a pen - after all, a pen is pretty much a pen - but here we go. The pen is pleasant to write with and the ink is smooth. I really liked this pen.
