Given that, though, this kit seems pretty reasonable at the current price of about $37. This is a great moving kit with many of the items you will need for your move. This convenient kit has just enough for a dorm room move; any bigger move and you'll need more boxes and tape. This is a convenient kit containing medium and small boxes along with some bubble wrap. My kit came with 2 MARKERS, both good quality. If you are moving, this kit supplemented with some large boxes could be all you need. This is an OK moving kit. If you want an all in one moving kit this is a good start. This is a good kit if you have things like porcelain figurines or snow globes you want to pay special attention to when packing; just wrap them in bubble wrap and put them in the small boxes. Other than that this was a good kit, recommended for assisting with any size move but just be aware you may still need more boxes if you have a decent amount of stuff. What's nice about the kit is that it has boxes of varying sizes.Note to self, put books in the small boxes or mix them with light stuff. This is a great affordable kit. The kit iteself i feel is designed for a standard move, nothing too big or too major, maybe like a child off to college or into an apartment. Eitherway the kit is a good start in the right direction. This would be a great kit to order for a move!
