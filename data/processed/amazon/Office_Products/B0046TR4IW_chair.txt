)The chair was comfortable, to me, though my husband felt it could use a little more padding in the seat cushion. ($180 would be too much for this chair, but $76 is a pretty good price for what you're getting. The chair is very sturdy with a wide base. The chair is comfortable and adjusts height very easily. I needed a new chair for the computer desk in my bedroom - as the folding chair just wasn't working for my back. This chair is wonderful. The chair rolls easy, even over carpet. The chair is adjustable,even with a height that works for someone short like me (5 feet). The chair has good back and lumbar support, so you can work in it for longer periods of time without a lot of pain. The chair is well made and sturdy (quite heavy), so I would think even a larger person would be comfortable sitting in the chair. The chair seems to be made fairly well, overall. I ordered a a separate chair cushion to put on top of the seat.The handle on this chair pushes inward to lock the back rest in an upright position. This chair is somewhat comfortable and ok at its price point. For a chair you plan to spend a lot of time in, I suggest investing in a higher quality, better designed alternative. This chair fits the bill as an inexpensive alternative for the kids. This chair is a solid build and easy to assemble. One chair barely stayed together with the screws falling out all the time and the seat has no cushion as it's now flat and very uncomfortable. Another chair ($20 purchase my husband picked up from CVS) the seat cushion is tearing apart. The chair is well-built and sturdy. I love this chair. This is our 3RD HON chair. And choosing a chair online without having sat in it is not a smart thing to do. It really is a good solid chair IF it fits your back. I have now had this chair for a couple of months and it has worked well. The chair is comfortable, for a chair with no arms. I would reccomend this chair if you are looking for a decent basic office chair. This chair replaced a very basic office chair that was around 20 dollars cheaper when I purchased it. This HON chair was easy to assemble.

I simply repackaged the chair parts back into the Box and dropped it off at my local UPS shipping center.

I like the chair, but if you're super short or super tall, you may be disappointed.

When you sit in a chair, you want your thighs parallel to the ground.This chair has a deep seat, so that's another consideration.
