The printing is not fast, about 3 pages a minute. The printing process however can be quite slow, but that's no different than previous models I've used.The printer controls on the device itself are pretty easy to understand, and when you get error messages, there's usually only a button or two to push to correct the problem. Where your printing comes out is in a drawer near where the paper cassettes are also located, so it has taken me some time to remember to pull out the paper catching drawer from the front when I print.The scanner is also really nice and easy to use and offers great results. But if you want to do high-level printing with inks that can produce smudge, fade or water resistant, this is where the WorkForce printers come into use as they use DURABRITE ink cartridges.I felt that Epson was quite truthful about black and white and color printing as the  Expression Premium XP-600 was very quick. For those who don't do much printing, possibly only for homework needs or basic printing needs or just the occasional color photos this printer is perfect!But Epson has done a lot in making these budget printers so attractive. Photo printing is another noteworthy feature of this printer. )Two-sided (duplex) printing for brochures or newsletters in colorAbility to share between PC's at homeYou can scan, print or copy.Interesting features:Multiple cartridges to replace only the color that is emptyAutomatic 2-sided printingCan use recycled paper.Downsides:The ink cartridges that come with are not the high capacity, so when you need to replace the ink, it's not inexpensive; costs more than half the price of the printer itself.Does not come with a USB cable, but you probably already have a printer-to-USB at home already. You can download compatible mobile printing apps and instructions at [...].How doesn't like apps.Totally worth it! Also the double sided printing is nice that saves paper and time if you are prone to make mistakes trying to do double sided printing manually.The only thing I cannot speak for at this point would be the longevity of the printer because it is new for me. I generally use laser printing for my black and white prints (which has far lower per page costs) but this does seem slightly high for an inkjet. Excellent printing, small footprint, I couldn't ask for more! When I finally broke down and got this Epson, I was immediately glad I did: it's really quick, can do double-sided printing, and, again, it's so easy to set up. Most important of all the printing and copy quality is excellent. Great printing, barely dented the ink levels and chugged out the pages without a problem. The automatic 2 sided printing is nice. The printing is sharp and the photos are stunning, as they say, however I would advise buying the Epson photo paper.T
