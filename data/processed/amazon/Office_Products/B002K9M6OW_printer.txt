I don't even bother using a printer, just hand print to stick on binders, folders, and such, all buried in a heap of other similar kind. They didn't jam the printer, which is always a plus Most printer labels I've used in the past have had a solid backing sheet with another solid sticker layer over it - which includes a large sticker that will just get thrown away since it covers all the area where the actual labels aren't. It also seemed to work well in the printer. Easy to use with my Canon printer. They run well through the printer, and I like the sticker-free margins between the columns, as this makes for easy peeling.The colors are definitely neon, which is to say bright, but not obnoxiously so. They're colorful, removeable and easy to load into the printer. Goes through the printer well without jams. I like that they can go straight through the printer with an Avery compatible number.

And you can put them through a printer.
