I love the ink meter, now I can finally determine if the marker is empty! You can see how much ink you have left. The ink erases easily from my white board with little to no effort. I've noticed the ink doesn't dry up like my old pens used to so it doesn't leave a stain on my board.Another cool feature is being able to see how much ink is left. There is also a handy ink level area at the bottom that helps you see how low you are on ink at a glance. First, what I do like: the ink is dark, bold, and consistent. Whatever it is that they did with the ink also means that I get a consistent ink flow.I love the color on all of my white boards. It's also a great plus knowing how much ink is left so you know when to order more. I would have thought ink would migrate towards the tip, not away from it, to be used. The ink colors, even the green (which is the marker that I always have found to be the fastest to dry out and the hardest for students to see across a classroom) are nice and bright and easy to read from the back of the classroom (provided that you write largely enough, of course). The ink flows very smoothly and consistently.
