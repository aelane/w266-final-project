You're more likely to lose it (or have it "borrowed") before the generous ink supply runs out.Best disposable pen I've ever used. It is highly legible ink, very dark,slightly wide, but unlike most pens that write this boldly it does not have that magic marker lookor bleed through to the other side of the paper. And the ink flows well and you definitely get all the ink out before it stops writing. It doesn't resist like other gel ink rollers, and I rarely have a problem with it. The ink dries fairly quIckly, and it has a fairly decent black line. The ink flow is generous and it does take a few seconds to dry but the experience of writing with the pen is worth the time. The ink is bold and the writing is smooth & easy. But those were so messy and had to replace the ink cartridge which seem to drink ink!Then I found the Pilot G2 Retractable (and re-fill-able) ink Gel Pens! If the ink starts to write poorly I just scribble with it and then the ink comes out like normal. You can't use this ink on shiny paper - it will take forever to dry. It also has an ink indicator to let you know how much ink is left, since the pen is transparent. Also (and don't quote me on this) I believe the ink is permanent? The ink just flows out of it without any effort and it looks elegant on paper. They are my favorite ink pens. We use the green ink G2 pens at work and so we all knew they worked very well. I want the ink to dry quickly. I want the ink to be water-resistant. I do not want ink to build up on the pen point. The ink lasts longer, they are less likely to smear than the .7 pens, and they write with finer lines.

The black ink is darker, provides a more natural cushioned grip, and does not clog or skip in my experience.

The Bold Point ink flows perfectly, looks more professional, and is easier to read than the Fine Point.

The ink in my experience comes out very thin and dries very quickly and only smears *immediately* after writing.
