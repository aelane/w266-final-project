these labels are WAY expensive and not very sticky. I used to print out the labels on a standard sheet of paper, folded it in half, then used packing tape to attach it to the box. The half-sheet sized labels make sense because that's how large the labels are on popular shipping sites such as UPS.com and USPS Click-n-ship. As you know, they use SUPERGLUE to ensure that their labels stick! These labels lay directly over the Amazon labels and you cannot see through them!After reading from other reviewers that I could "turn off receipts" (which normally print on the second half of the page) I knew it was the perfect solution! With this, I was able to determine where my labels would print. I've used them to create labels with USPS's Click-N-Ship program as well as with PayPal Shipping, and on both platforms they print out very clean, bright, and professional looking. Because the labels are so nice and thick, they don't wrinkle at all once on the package, and they entirely block out any old labels or markings on the box underneath.My business uses off-brand shipping labels that are thin, hard to remove from their backings, and wrinkle up with the slightest change in temperature or moisture in the air. They cost only about a fourth as much as these name-brand labels, but at times I wonder whether the upfront cost savings is worth the extra aggravation and time consumption caused by using a poor product. Both of these labels also have TrueBlock technology to cover old labels.Avery supplies instructions for downloading templates from its website. If you try to reuse as much as possible these labels are a great way to reuse shipping boxes. And these Avery labels are just the ticket. What else can I say, they are great labels, as with most all Avery products. I called Avery to ask if these labels could also be used in a laser printer. I am really happy that these extra large labels (2 to a page) are so useful. I've used smaller labels but it usually takes several plus you can often see through them. I can also make unique labels for mailed gifts. I printed some especially chosen art on two labels and used them to cover a small box. The labels print well, release cleanly from the backing, but stick well to the chosen package. You can't go wrong with these labels! So the Amazon labels tend to have a little line print on the top (the "Amazon seller" line) that will just be up top. These labels are the perfect size for printing out prepaid ups or usps labels. Good labels. For how many labels you get in one of these packs, I'd say it's definitely worth it if you are a small-medium volume eBay seller. They are convenient since they are labels and they save me lots of time. These labels are made of a heavy stock paper with a grey / silver lining on the underside that completely blocks the old label. Since most labels of this size are all the same, this makes using the old box as simple as throwing a label on it. Enter these labels. The labels (2 per sheet) take up all of the space on the 8 1/2"x11" sheet, so perhaps there was just no room. My labels are now a much more effective communication medium for my brand. These labels will also actually work effectively as mailing label/box sealer for smaller boxes. :)Fortunately, these labels save a lot of that hassle. These nifty labels solve both problems. They're thick and opaque enough to completely cover old labels. These labels make life a lot easier than printing the postage on paper and then covering the paper with tape, while not covering any barcodes.The one bad issue, the labels are two per page, horizontally placed. What you need to do is seperate the two labels, which are perferated and place them in the printer the long way and they work fine. These labels are so handy in that regard, because not only do they block out the previous label but they cover up any rips or leftover bits of sticker on the box, making a re-used box look neater. There are cheaper labels out there, but Avery usually gives consistent results. I'm happy to see that the TrueBlock labels actually do a good job of completely covering what is underneath. This was fine until I tried these labels. These labels are a great value when you can make use of both labels on the sheet. The labels are of the high quality typical of Avery products. These labels are a great solution. These labels just cover everything up.Avery recommended using Template 5126, and is supposed to work with [...], USPS Click-N-Ship, and eBay/PayPal online postage. The labels are split in the middle of a 8.5x11 paper, so as long as your label prints out on the adhesive label you desire, it will work.Pros: Very very very easy to use, TrueBlock is a time saver, and it makes shipping items that much easier.Cons: NoneOverall: 5/5 These labels give your box a professional look. They cover old labels so that you can reuse boxes. There are 2 labels per sheet, and I cut the page in half and insert in my printer. These labels are nice and cutting them before using is the only "con". I printed around 30 of my usual generic labels tonight with no problem before switching to the Avery's.On the other hand, the actual labels continue to be best in the business. I use labels for my business, & it would be useful to know if Avery is now using this thin backing on all their labels. I like these labels. Because they're nearly identical to the Avery 8127 labels with one major difference. These (the #8126 labels) have no plain paper receipt. If you're making -sheet labels with no receipt or other information on the other half of the page, then these can be inverted and reinserted into the printer to print a 2nd label. You then get two labels per sheet, or 50 labels total, for much less than the price of the 25 label sheets in the #8127 product (only one label with a plain paper bottom half). Otherwise, if you print these labels from Paypal (for Ebay purchases), the top label is going to print perfectly, and the bottom one is going to get your receipt printed on it, effectively doubling your costs. These are the perfect labels. The labels printed out fine on my HP inkjet printer and the TrueBlock feature really does work to block out old labels. These labels advertise as being great for Click N Ship (the USPS method used by eBay and many other home selling companies). If you print shipping labels with postage from your computer using services like UPS or PayPal's shipping system, these labels do the trick nicely. The labels stick well and have the additional feature of being thick enough to block the view of whatever you put them over. As most of you I'm used to Avery labels. The similar Avery 5327 labels have a section for printing the receipt, but at almost $.50 each, they are way overpriced.These labels are about half that price per label, and also work in laser printers. I tried the cheaper labels but these are worht spending a little more. I mean, these labels aren't cheap. I really love these labels. The Avery labels print perfectly with my new Canon wireless printer to make single labels with no attached receipt (see FlyingPolarBear's excellent instructions).It took me a little while to figure out how a few programs would work, and in these cases, I printed my usual paper label, and used the copy function on my printer to create the single sided label. These Avery labels are very good heavy weight labels and are great at covering up prior shipping labels when reusing boxes. These labels look high quality when printed out and give your packages a professional look. You get two labels per sheet so you can print out one label and then reuse that sheet to print out another. these labels worked really well. This is a messy and time-consuming approach.These labels have a lot going for them:* Work in both ink jet and laser printers* Completely cover old labels* Strong adhesive won't peel off* Much faster than my previous approach* Eliminates need for a dedicated label printerJust make sure you set USPS to only print the mailing label or you'll lose half of each page. What makes the Avery labels better than the others is their &#34;TrueBlock&#34; technology, which guarantees that nothing printed on your shipping box will show through on the label. These labels are great if you sell on eBay or Amazon. These labels really do cover up other labels 100%. I was doubtful these new labels with "Trueblock technology" would really completely cover whatever was underneath, so I tried one first on a used box with a very darkly inked label. I've been longing for labels like these. )Concerns aside, I am really happy with these labels and gladly welcome them into my home office. I do like these labels. Full-page adhesive labels like this aren't usually this affordable. The labels make it easy to reuse boxes because they have a gray blocking layer that covers any writing or printing underneath.I've had no trouble using my ink-jet printer to print the labels and the Avery templates make it snap to produce professional looking results. These labels are just right for eBay shipping. )They come with two labels per sheet, and the size is perfect for the labels that eBay uses through USPS. What I used to do it print out the labels on regular paper and apply 'em with tape, thereby thinking I saved myself from wasting money in buying the labels; however, I've come to realize that one label would take up an entire sheet of paper since the other half was virtually un-usable by my printer. So I caved in and bought the labels, and they are well worth their value.I prefer these over the Avery 5327 because these (8126), in my opinion, stick better. I sometimes have to apply these labels over some tape, and the 5327 showed some peeling off before I even shipped the package; with these, I haven't found the similar situation yet.I'm not sure what the difference is between these and Avery's 8127. In that, I prefer some of the cheaper labels that seem to have a more &#34;100% permanent&#34; adhesive.It's ok, and if you need the trublock feature badly, it could be useful for you. These labels are GREAT. I started getting Avery labels since I first tried them... no problems whatsoever. The labels also work great to block out any bleed-through so you don't see any labels you're covering up. These labels work great. No more printing labels on regular paper and taping them on for me, I'll definitely be keeping a stack of these labels on hand from now on. I love these labels, although I still put clear tape over the address area, and over the delivery confirmation number--not the bar codes--because I fear if the labels get wet, the ink might smear. These labels are a nice, bright white. Arranged with 2 labels per 8x11 sheet. These labels are thicker than some labes I have tried in the past. Love these labels!Rather than printing on paper and affixing it with tape, you can do it all in one step with these labels.
