I have an old document stand I salvaged from somewhere that I've been using for years when I edit books. Unlike many other document holders, this one can easily be put away in a drawer as it disassembles. When I first saw this document holder I thought it was so out of the box, I just had to have it. It allows you to hang the document at or near eye level rather than having to look down at your desk.Theres many competing products on the market, and they all work in a similarly. This document lift is solid, simple and effective. This Fellowes document lift is a nice item to have for your office. The document holding clip attaches to any side of the dry erase memo board and is pretty sturdy. This document holder is set up next to me as I type. This document holder is quite handy and mostly well made. (I often find that it is expedient to photograph a document when a scanner is not available in order to create a digital record. This document lift is a great solution to my stiff neck issues.What I really like about this:~ it can be positioned vertically or horizontally.~ it can be a dry erase wipe off board.~ it has a good viewing angle.~ it has a sturdy clip that will easily hold an entire notepad firmly.~ it dismantles quickly for flat storage.~ it has a nicely weighted base that keeps it solidly in place.The only thing I didn't like is that as I pushed it into the bottom, the edge of the board pops out a little giving me the impression that it may not hold up as long as I would like. I like how this document holder doubles as a dry erase board. I've never had/tried a document lift, so I was excited to see what it's all about. The Fellowes Document Lift is a document holder, dry-erase board and a clip board all in one item. Like other document holders, this product is useful for typing into the computer, as you can easily refer to the what your typing at eye-level without having to looking down, etc. This isn't cheap, but very versatile: it's a document holder, white board, magnetic board and clipboard all in one. If you need a document holder, this Fellowes I-Spire is fantastic! When I saw that this document stand had a weighted base, I knew I had to give it a try.So far, I love it. The document holder comes in three pieces: the very heavy base, the mid section that doubles as a dry erase board, and the top clip. I have a couple document holders already that open up like a ladder. Even if you found a document thick enough to make the unit top-heavy, I doubt that the top clip would hold it. The Fellowes I-Spire Series Document Lift really is a pretty cool document holder.
