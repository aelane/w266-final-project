If you don't do that, then you'll be stuck having to switch it manually every time you print it out of Word; which gets annoying real fast.Design:  This is a very sleek looking machine that looks very professional. It's been a long time since I've used an Epson but have made the transition from Brother and been quite satisified. Oh but this is another time when the paper trays could be an issue... it only prints from tray 1.+ Almost every utility has easy or advanced modes so if you just want to scan or print you don't need to know all the technical aspects of it, but if you do know exactly what you want you can get to it fairly easily.+ Need ruled or graph paper... no problem, just select from the printer's menu and viola, instant paper.+ All varieties of memory card and direct print options.I really could go on, it's a beautiful machine and would work well in an office or a busy home. But this time I did install the extra software and so far am impressed with the Easy Photo Print. This was the most time consuming procedureduring my setup.Then I installed the printer driver using the enclosed CD withdriver/software. The Epson printed just fine, but it took an inordinately long time (~3 minutes) to scan a document at 300 dpi. This saves so much time and so much paper. The first time I did a scan I though something was wrong because it was so quiet. Further, the time it takes from sending the print request to actually printing, is far faster on the Epson than the HP.The results are good. Not that it was hard to do before but it saves time of me having to reinsert the paper all the time.My big drawback is that the Epson ink is expensive, you can check the prices on Amazon, but I find genuine regular Epson ink is the most expensive of the big brands (Epson, HP, and Cannon). Printing time was speedy. So we each time we ran out of Cyan, the whole color cartridge had to be replaced. At this time, the cheapest price I could find to replace all 4 cartridges with new, extra-high capacity Epson brand cartridges is $63. This was the first time I have purchased a printer outside of the HP brand for many years. After having used it for a time, I can say this is a very solid printer that does everything I want (and a bit more).Setup was a breeze, as it should be. So it was time to get something that would cover all the bases that we needed - fast draft printing, fax machine and most importantly for this printer; double-sided printing.Firstly the bad - unlike other Epson printers I have I absolutely could not get this one to log into our WEP enabled network and thus perform wirelessly. But the first time I tried double-sided printing was when I was truly blown away. I cannot emphasize how much this is a huge time saver if you need to print on both sides regularly.In terms of look and feel the current crop of Espon's printers come in a rectangular black and so the unit really doesn't even resemble a printer of old like the Lexmark or the beige HP inkjet all-in-ones.
