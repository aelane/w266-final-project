I definitely appreciated the Bluetooth printing capability because we have multiple printers in our household. And when you're finished printing, fold away the paper guides and you'll be impressed at just how compact it is. Our printing needs are very low volume and speed is not a factor with us. Document printing was OK for the most part, although some documents that I downloaded (or viewed) online took a too long to print, and when they did the blacks were not all that sharp. Black-and-white printing is slow, but color printing is even more slower (about 3 minutes per page).2. No double-side printing capability.Here are some PROs of this printer:1. Photo printing is another noteworthy feature of this printer. The printing is okay, but it also wouldn't be my first choice if good photo prints was something you need. If your printing needs are pretty minimal and you just need a good quality, lower-end printer, then this is a good choice for you. For day-to-day basic printing needs, this is a decent printer. Overall not long and the printing is quiet.Printing documents in black and white were quick and very good.After printing 1 8x10, 10 4x6 and 2 5x7 photos and several black and white documents I have close to full black ink, yellow is less than 1/4 gone, magenta is a little more than 1/4 gone and cyan is almost 3/4 gone. While it has basic printing, scanning, and media card photo functions, it does not contain much extras. Wireless printing works flawlessly when hooked up to my wireless router. The printing really is quiet.
