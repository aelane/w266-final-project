So I was curious to see how this new way to stick worked.The dot roller delivers what it promises. It's clean, fast, easy and just the only way to stick things together.This item is perfect for crafts, scrapbooking, and just general, everyday gluing needs, like sealing envelopes or wrapping presents. I'm very pleased with how it works and the nice easy way I can apply it to small pieces without stringing. I don't yet have any way of knowing how long the adhesive lasts, but I haven't had a problem so far.Thumbs up from me. I think this is a great way to use adhesives.Its totally not messy and love the dotted clean pattern of the glue.Not sure how fast I would have to change the cartridges though depending on how much I use this product.My son is into lots of craft work for now and I think this is a great non messy alternative to liquid glues.I use them for envelopes and stamps too and they are perfectly handy.Excellent product. This is by far the cleanest way for him to use on his projects. It definitely would not be the cheapest way to do a ton of craftwork, but if you just need to do school or work projects once in a while and don't want to take a ton of time messing with other adhesives, this is a quick way to get the work done neatly.I will note, as others have, that it's not the most durable adhesive. Sticks way better than glue sticks, hands down.

This is the only way to go for affixing photos to cards, scrapbooks, etc.

It still works pretty much the way you would expect it to.I used it to attach photos to paper, and it did a nice job of adhering the photos to the paper permanently.

I would pick it up and roll it the wrong way, or check to see if there are still dots to use and end up just getting some on my fingers.
