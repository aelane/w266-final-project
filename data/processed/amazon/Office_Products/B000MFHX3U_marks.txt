It takes off new marks easily but also was able to take off the older marks that we hadn't been able to get clean. Now don't get me wrong, I love them, and I find them very useful for getting marks off of painted walls, but I don't see any difference between this and any other version.Now on to how it works on whiteboard...From the best that I can tell the pacakage implies that no sprays or cleaners (or water) are needed to clean regular whiteboards with regular markers. These are pretty good at removing those rub marks. It doesn't always get off all of the marks but it does for the most part. Then the marks are impossible to clean by dry rubbing. Whiteboard marks have now been, not removed exactly, but rather smeared into large wet diluted splotches.7. Eventually, you inevitably end up with marks that won't come off. We were left with marks all over the board that wouldn't come off. It will also get marks off your walls and floors &lt;wink>Great product but check your coupons and prices and purchase whichever offers you the most cleaning bang for your buck. There were some marks that had been on the board for a while, and they resisted rubbing. It never fails, he always leaves the marks on there without cleaning, but he's 4. This takes off marks I haven't been able to get off with anything else. And, indeed it does.3M also claims it removes old (stained) marks. Some of the marks had been there since I bought it (used). More stubborn marks came off well when water was used. It is very effective; it works either for freshly applied marks or even for an old dried set of marks. The marks are still visible, in any case. They pick up the marks quickly, without any trouble, and leaves very little, if any, flecks behind. Yes, it works... on those marks that you left on the board too long; on the marks made by "dying" dry-erase pens that normally leave shadows with a normal eraser (or a towel as I have been using the past few years). It sure beats smearing the marks around the way a typical "fuzzy" whiteboard eraser does. I couldn't wipe off the deep marks of old writing, especially the ones done with a black marker.
