If you recycle like I do, this will solve the "tab" problem very nicely. Because the Avery tab is more textured, I find writing on it a bit easier. So I just went in and made a new tab for each folder. Each tab has adhesive that holds well to the page but can also be removed if needed. When going to a tab made out of cheap, ineffective materials and it pulls off from minor use it is frustrating. I regularly feel that a tab is needed such as for creating a fairly durable tab for a favorite portion of a book (like a cookbook) or dividing up sections of a notebook. Now I simply add this tab to the right page and write on it a title. With the tab title in bold all caps right under the color stripe, I can easily get 4 lines of typed text under the title (5 lines in a pinch). So if you want a tab you can use and move - PERFECT. If you want a more permanent tab, you might want to tape it down. This is a nice, sturdy post-it tab in four colors, pink, yellow, orange, and green.
