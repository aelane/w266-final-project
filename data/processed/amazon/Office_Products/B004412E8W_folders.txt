I began to get organized by labeling the folders with various categories; reciepts, pictures, lists, reference materials, places I wanted to go, places I had been. There's just not much more I can say about these folders other than the fact that every time I look at one from this day forward, I'm going to think about what Manila really means. These are standard folders like many I have used and reused for years. These are excellent folders, but unless you have a real need for a larger tab, nothing special. These brightly colored folders with 3 part tabs are a hit. The folders themselves are fairly heavy duty; I expect them to last a long time. Put these heavyweight folders side by side with the standard fare and you will feel the difference. Sometimes it doesn't matter if your folders are a bit flimsy, but it's nice to have one of these more solid folders in your hand if you have a lot of papers in one. My old folders were getting in pretty bad shape and I was ready for some new folders. Those folders are absolute the best we have used. The folders use 1/3 cut tabs so you can easily align your folders in the filing drawer.These are really heavyweight and now that I have used them I could no go back to those lightweight folders even for a couple of bucks savings. I expect these folders to last a very long time. These folders have tabs whose heights are 1.75 inches. Not that you really need more...All in all, great folders. These are super folders and I found them both practical to use and handy with the oversize tags which mean I can use larger labels. Still, these superior folders are built to last and I am very pleased with them! That folders are very durable and I love the long tabs. These are great folders. File folders come in a standard size, and let's be honest... These folders are "heavyweight" which makes them a slightly heavier cardboard then the normal manila folders we used in grade school. The folders fit any filing system, vertical or lateral, are scored for 3/4" expansion, and have 10% recycled content and 10% post-consumer material.The folders come in 4 assorted colors which is nice but not a deal breaker either way for me. These folders are built well and are colorful. The folders themselves are thicker than economical folders I have used in the past (14 point versus 11 point), but I do not find them to be ultra thick. These folders truly are heavy weight. This does not make the folders too high to fit in a standard file cupboard however. I love file folders that feel great in my hands, hold up well over time, have sufficient room for labels, and are easy to identify at a glance--and Smead's Heavyweight SuperTab folders meet these criteria perfectly. These folders are really nice- as others have said, the fact that they are heavyweight means they'll last a long time. But these folders are definitely going to be more durable than regular manila folders as they are heavyweight. Best, strongest folders I've ever handled, stuffed into a briefcase or filed away.MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! These Smead folders are fantastic and super heavy duty. I am pleased with these folders. These are 1/3 cut folders with a cut-out on the top that makes more of the tab area visible. These folders are a good match for file-oriented organizers, such as the Smead 70211 12-Pocket Tiered Stadium File. I love these folders. The Smead heavyweight SuperTab folders are a good choice for home or business use. These sturdy folders will not warp or bend easily. Since these folders are a bit more expensive than average, they would probably be more appropriate for the serious filer than for casual users. If you need eye-catching folders that will stand up over time and resist wear and tear, you will probably not mind spending a bit more for this well-made product. The folders in the box of 50 are in 4 different colors - red-green-yellow and blue - so if you are a color coder these are the folders for you. These extra-tough, thick folders, like the ones I used to see on a regular basis but no more, can handle anything you care to file in them. These folders have all three.I held one up for comparison to the standard folders I'm used to taking for granted. Also, with the 50 folders selling for under $18, this comes to close to $.035/folder - which is quite a bargain. These are nice folders. I compared them to my older folders and found that "medium weight" is the new "lightweight." The folders open to " but with this new design the name of the folder tendency to slip down into the non-readable zone is less than with other folders. Perhaps there are similar folders that are inferior, I don't know. All I know is these are good solid folders that stay in place and keep my papers neatly in order. Smead's Supertab Heavyweight folders have a number of pros:* They are sturdy. LOLThese folders are nice and sturdy and I have every confidence that they will last quite some time without wearing out too soon.I'm very happy with these folders and would recommend them. The folders are VERY sturdy yet are not extra thick or heavy which is an important consideration if you are lugging files around in a banker's box or if drawer and storage space is a concern. These folders have extra wide writing tabs - the narrow ones never have enough room for me to write my novel length folder names (can't you tell from my reviews? LOL)All in all, I highly recommend these folders and am glad to have added them to my organizational system. I am so glad to have found these Smead folders. These are thick and sturdy, like how I remember file folders *should* be. I am thrilled with these folders! Actually, these folders meet so many needs that "plain vanilla/manila" folders don't and the difference makes my time at the desk so much easier and more efficient that the folders are a thrill!The four different colors are a great help in categorizing general topics and useful for sorting priority versus less urgent items.The large 1/3 cut tabs give plenty of room to apply larger labels or write in really descriptive file names.The folders are made from a much sturdier and heavier material than most folders I have seen in my 40+ years of office supply usage making them useful for even heavy files. It's hard to get excited about folders, but these are quite excellent. There is not much you can say about folders - they have been around for a long time and are a "mature" technology.These folders are sturdy and the extra large label tab will be really helpful - labels are always getting hidden behind bulging papers in a file folder.The colors are nice, and let you color code files, which is a tremendous help for those who are not color blind.They came in a sturdy box as one would expect, and just work well.These are a very good substitute for regular manila file folders. These folders are really well made. Because I like to place folders of materials I want to be able to find easily within case folders, I was attracted to these because of their bright colors. I write on these folders in pencil, so I may erase and reuse, but one could also place file folder labels over the previous designation.These folders do cost more than some which are thinner, but I find that many of those less sturdy folders start shredding and need to be replaced mid-task. I love these folders! These heavyweight folders take a lot more abuse and since they come in assorted colors I can color code my cases and match the folders to the binders and portfolios for each case, thereby ensuring that I don't mix case files. We like to use colored folders because it's easier to find the file you're looking for. The folders are definitely heavy duty, and I am glad to get boxes of 50 at a time, as opposed to usually finding them packed in a pack of 10 or 25. The Smead SuperTab heavywieght folders are design to hold a serious amount of paperwork. The folders are very sturdy and should remain so after many years (depending on use for filing...even good in a backpack to hold papers you are working on currently).The material is easy to write on using a standard ball-point pen which is a nice feature as some folders can have a slight wax coating that makes it hard to write on them with a ball-point Pen.You should be able to reuse the folders many times is you do not write too large on the tabs. These are really nice folders, and one day maybe I will use them, but I am a chronic recycler almost to the extend of being a hoarder and I keep reusing things like folders until they literally fall apart in my hand. The 50 or so folders I bought 20 years ago are still being relabeled and relabeled, and although I am excited to have these colored ones, it may be 2025 before I allow myself the privilege of using a brand new folder. If you store these folders in hanging folders, the lower part of the label area will be hidden. Maybe these should be called SuperTab SuperHeavyweight folders, they certainly give the impression that they will withstand plenty of use. I think these folders will make my filing a lot easier. I've been using these folders for a few months and they haven't started fraying or bending, even with heavy use. The folders are not those flimsy kind that can only hold so much. Most file folders I've encountered are getting flimsier and more sloppily made. The folders also have larger tabs, making labeling easier. But best of all, these folders are sturdy and sure to last longer than other file folders.With 50 folders per box, the Smead SuperTab Heavyweight Folders make for a remarkable buy to anyone looking to improve a filing system. With standard folders, often I have to sort through one by one to find a file that has been obscured by papers added to other files. The Smead SuberTab Heavyweight folders have nice durable feel, thicker than the average manila folder. The Smead Super Tab heavyweight folders are a nice addition to their product line, and they truly have a much heavier weight to them than most other file folders. These folders are part of the Sustainable Forest Initiative, they are made partly of post-consumer recycled content, and are made in the United States. Smead Heavyweight folders are definitely heavier and stronger than regular file folders. When I used the heavyweight folders, I quickly noticed the extra strength and particularly like that they do not flop around and spill my papers. These Smead Heavyweight SuperTab folders are wonderful.First, they really are a heavy weight stock (4x stronger) which means they are not flimsy. I recommend these folders for their heavyweight material. For those of us with full, bulging folders, this is an additional benefit. File folders are great, heavy duty with tons of space on the tab for all the notes you can put on them. They are sturdier than most file folders, and their bright colors make it easy to identify them by topic.An extra wide tab provides ample space for writing down important identification information. ).Because they are not as inexpensive as most file folders, I would not recommend them for most short-term filing.All in all, these folders proved a great alternative for special purposes.T
