The grip is very comfortable and has a nice feel to it.After writing two pages, the point was still sharp. However, the grip is terrible. The "grip" is the shaped plastic/raised "rings" in the grip area. Also the grip is a slick clear plastic, which does not feel comfortable or give a sense of control. I wish the grip was slightly bigger and more rubbery. There's not much of a grip on this pencil. The grip is comfortable for long-term writing, and the "twist and turn" mechanism - though I was skeptical about how gimmicky it seemed - maintains a sharp point on the led consistently. There is a grooved grip that helps keep your hands from sliding around. This should provide superior grip, but I found the Uni-Ball KuruToga to have a cheap slick plastic feel.

The "grip" is simply hard plastic and the lead itself seems to bounce each time the pencil touches down on paper.

This is a great new feature.The grip of the pencil is alright, but made of hard plastic.

The grip area is made out of slightly ribbed, clear plastic and is in need of something to give it a little more friction for a more solid hold.
