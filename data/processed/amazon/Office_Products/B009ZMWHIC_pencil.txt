If you tilt the pencil the slightest bit, you get uneven sharpening. So if you read some one had a clogged pencil sharpener than that is because they were too lazy to clean it out. It sharpens fast and you need to hold your pencil with a sure grip, no limp wrists.Perfect point every time no high edges of wood around the lead on one side. This is a solid pencil sharpener. This is a nice pencil sharpener. I have an old Panasonic pencil sharpener, that's been working without any problems for at least 10 years (I can't even remember when I bought it). Well, the pencil tip isn't ground out quite evenly enough for my taste, you get a bit more wood on one side, a bit less on the other. It is nice that it stops sharpening when the pencil is sharp, but as another reviewer mentioned the motors keep going. An LED &#34;pencil is sharpened&#34; light would be nice. Each pencil we sharpened came out looking great! I had another electric pencil sharpener in my classroom that lasted about 6 months and was less expensive. I like that it stops sharpening when it detects the pencil is all the way sharpened. I am a colored pencil artist. If a pencil is just dull, this sharpener will sharpen it in a second or two. Zip a pencil in, feel for a bit of resistance, and pull out a sharpened pencil. When a pencil is inserted, the motor spins but the cutter is not engaged. This pencil sharpener works as promised. My last pencil sharpener was a huge flop. This X-acto pencil sharpener is wonderful. It works as most electronic pencil sharpeners do. Simply press the pencil in hole and it will begin sharpening. Once the pencil is sharp, it will stop shaving the pencil to a point. So far, this is the best pencil I've owned.

Basically, as soon as you put the pencil in the sharpener, it's stopping.

Yes the pencil was a shorty but I thought I could just give the sharpener a "love tap".

Roughly tried another pencil and I believe the machine is already broken.
