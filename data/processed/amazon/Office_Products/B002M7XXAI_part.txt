Since the part that sticks to the page is clear, it doesn't cover up anything on the page. Also, you can write on the tab part as well as the part that sticks to the page. And the sticky part stays in place (even if it's on something where you're turning pages), can be repositioned many times, and leaves no residue when you move it. AND - here's the best part - you can write OR highlight on both tab and body! The part that sticks is clear, so you can read what's under it, on the page. Don't write it on the clear part, it won't stay.Overall, I like the width of this product because I can write more than just a couple of letters on it. The "clear" part does have adhesive all on the back of it, so it totally sticks to your page:  The back of the package says that it "Won't damage documents or lift ink" with this caveat--"Results may vary depending on paper thickness and type of ink. The clear part is see through, so it does not obstruct your text, and the tab itself can be written on.I really really love these and am constantly finding new uses for them.

The part of the tab that adheres to the paper is translucent, so you can make out what's beneath it.

I'm still working this part out.

The tab part (that sticks up from the tabbed page) is pastel in color and writing shows up easily.
