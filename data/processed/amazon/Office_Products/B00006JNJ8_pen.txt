This is really an awesome pen. I'm not sure if it's weird to have a favorite pen. The pen has an excellent build for its price, with good plastic and rubber used. I think this is my new favorite pen! I just tried this pen out and compared it to the Uniball Signo 207. I'm just starting with this pen, but right now - it looks great. This is a very nice pen, it writes well and does not smudge on paper. This is really an awesome pen. The pen's clip on its top comes down low enough to rest on your hand while you are writing if you don't have it rotated away from you which could annoy some people but that don't bother me. And I've never used a pen that has written better than this one. This is the best pen especially for legal documents, never seems to run out and is ready to go when needed. I really like this pen. Great G2 pen, with a 0.38 fine point.I write in small margins so having a small ultra fine tip is very important to me.Writes smooth as the larger 0.5 or 1.0mm pens, and LOVE the fine print! This is really an awesome pen. I've been searching for a pen that works and works on different surfaces. This is actually a nice pen. This doesn't happen with the fine-tipped pen, but it could also be the way I write; I sometimes bear down on the paper more than the average person. This extra-fine pen writes more like a ballpoint than a gel pen, in my experience.All things considered, both pens work really well. For me, writing with this pen is not very smooth, also there are times when the ink does not come out at consistently. I no longer want to use this pen at all because of it. This is my favorite pen. It is a click pen, and it doesn't appear to be any louder than other click pens; it may be slightly quieter.I cannot recommend the black pens because they are not as reliable, and I have not used the two other colors, but I can tell you that the regular blue pens are my go-to pens now. I am very picky about the pen I use. I want the pen to have a retractable point for convenient use. I want the pen to work satisfactorily on a variety of kinds of paper and paper surfaces and textures. But the Pilot G-2 Bold pen does extremely well in all of these areas. I don't know if any other pen as good as this one.
