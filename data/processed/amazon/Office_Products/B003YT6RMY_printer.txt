This printer sits only a couple of feet away from the router. Once I restart the printer, viola it works fine. Sometimes this printer is so aggravating that it wastes so much time and is problematic.I was never able to get my old Mac which is running 10.4 to work with this printer at all. I don't think I've seen a better, more-efficiently packed printer ever. I suppose you could use it to carry the printer though it doesn't look very strong. It feels like a nice solid printer. I have this printer on a smaller table right now and it jerks the table rather violently while it is printing. This printer needs to be placed on a VERY SOLID piece for furniture.The second time I printed a document using the QuickOffice interface on the Zeen display, the printer ran out of paper. It is almost as if the printer and the Zeen display were designed separately and then paired up for this combination without thinking it all through. If the printer is turned off, it is not possible to send documents to the printer. It would be better to force the printer on when you send a document, especially if the Zeen is powered on in the cradle-mode. It is either on or off, but you can control the Zeen and the printer independently.Overall, would I get another All-in-One C150? This printer was a real shock to me. I hadn't gotten a new printer since 2003 and that printer (Dell All-in-One) was still in good condition and fine working order. So when I got this HP printer up and running, I was a bit overwhelmed by just how far printers have come. I would like to see this printer have compatibility for scanning slides into photos. This is a nice printer. Sometimes you're even lucky if your printer installs on the latest hardware and operating systems! When installing my other Epson printer, I was nagged by 20 security dialogs on Windows 7 64-bit and had to make a tech support call to even setup scanning from my Mac! They were able to locate the printer via AirPrint instantly and print emails, documents and web pages without issue, even given the option to use double-sided printing if desired! This is an AWESOME, beyond basic printer, ONCE it's connected. There was no manual with this printer and the online version isn't much help either. I think I need a "How to hook up this printer for Dummies book".All that said, once it was operational I found that it is an AMAGING  printer/scanner/copier. You can operate the printer from anywhere in the house and print out things you are viewing on the web from it. I like the printer, the quality is there, but I wish it either had bigger tanks or used less ink. Too bad, it is a good printer. The printer figures out which paper should be used based on what you sent it and spits out the print.
