Compared to the the more traditional modelall-metalSwingline staplers I have, this model is definitely taller, but lighter since it's made of plastic. It works just like most desk top staplers but requires less effort to punch through a lot of sheets.It also has a bit more clearance so it is easier to get a stack of paper in there.I wish I'd had this around tax time as more than once things have gone missing, requiring me to find and reproduce  them and then run them over to my accountant. The new Swingline LightTouch Reduced Effort Stapler is so much better than the staplers of the past. I own several staplers with the reduced-effort stapling. It is a little longer and taller than those other staplers. We've got about a half-dozen Swingline staplers in our home and home office and I've used even more at work over the years. You never know with staplers but one has high expectation for the Swingline brand.$13 is a lot for what is something that has a plastic body. Swingline is known for staplers. It's so much better designed than other staplers I've tried and easier to use than the old swingline that was on my desk. It's much easier than staplers where you have to really squeeze hard or place it on a hard surface and give it a firm push to get a nice secure staple. I think I have used Swingline staplers for as long as I've been stapling. I have several staplers around the house from small ones to long-arm staplers. Most of this staplers are Swingline brand as it's a brand that I trust. We must own about 10 staplers ... 8 of which are Swingline. Most, if not all, Swingline staplers do their job well and this stapler is no exception. Most of the staplers I've used made it difficult to staple half that amount. Unlike other Swingline staplers I have which are made out of metal and follow the traditional basic mechanics of a stapler, this stapler is made out of plastic, weighted in the base and tail end and features a unique interior spring design that makes it easy to staple and easy to load. Comparing it to traditional staplers, it definitely is a cut above. Neither of my Bostitch staplers (a B440 and B660) can get through even ten sheets of my lightest paper, 20lb white copy paper.

Well, all staplers are easy to use right?

I like it better than standard staplers, because the slightly extra height (probably related to the reduced effort design) means it more-easily fits into my hand.The standard staplers you could spin around in your hand and would have to do a some slight contortions to get it in the right location in your hand to easily staple something.This one is easy to grab from your desk, already fills out your palm and you can quickly and more-easily start stapling.The reason I gave 4 stars is because you cannot un-latch the bottom so that you could staple on things like corkboard or your cubicle wall, etc.

I own 4 staplers which are in use throughout the house.
