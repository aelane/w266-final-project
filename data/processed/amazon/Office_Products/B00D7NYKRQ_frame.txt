While the frame is not fancy it has a homey look to it that goes so well with much of the d&eacute;cor items that are so popular right now.I give it a rating of 4 because I have never gotten over loving the slate chalk boards the best . But what's especially nice about is the attractive frame and, even more, the compact size which makes it not overbearing in a room the way most chalkboards can be. The frame comes with some sticky tape and magnets so you can attach it to your wall or your fridge. The frame has a nice wide wooden finish and sets it off nicely. You could probably make a better onr fairly easily with your own frame and chalkboard paint, but I don't know if that could be done for less than the cost of this one. I love the frame around it, because it adds so much to the look of the board as well as the room. The frame itself is also a pressed board that has been covered with a wood look product. But the frame is &#34;wood grain&#34;, like it was meant to be compatible in '70s era finished basement with dark wood paneling. The frame is pretty but it's paper covered pressed something and dents easily. The outside frame if the chalkboard measures 14x14&#34;  The actual chalkboard area is 11.5x11.5.It does not come with any chalk. The frame itself is at least an inch wide on each side.I personally can't write very small with a piece of chalk.But otherwise, it seems to be pretty well constructed. It's very sturdy as it's set in a frame. The frame is a &#34;wood finish&#34; and also quite light. The frame is very wide which leaves you with far less than the 8.5 x 11 space.

The wooden frame is solid and made out of quality wood.

The frame is mediocre quality, but in actuality, it looks nice overall.

It looks like the frame is some nice hardwood... it's not.
