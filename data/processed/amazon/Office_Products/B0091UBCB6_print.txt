Text print looks just like toner. Duplex print is about 7 and 5 pages per minute, in black and color, respectively. The print density settings is what I utilize the most on this unit as it allows me to buy the cheaper thinner paper and still print double sided as I can lower the amount of ink put the paper so there is no bleed through. If you want to print, all you have to do is print, and the printer turns back on automatically, and prints as if it were never off.I print coupons online, and my old printer would print the barcode poorly, so the coupons didn't scan at the stores. The print quality is very good and the included high capacity ink cartridges are a real bonus. print quality is very good. Usually those print out in less than a minute, so it's a quick system they have, another bonus for this printer.Edit Jan 2014 - Once again I'm back to the apparently common "date/time reset" problem at power on. The print quality is excellent. It has a print icon that I clicked and was able to print no problem. The print heads have been a problem on the comparably priced Lexmark and only time will tell how the Epson will be in the that regard. I also like the 2-sided print capability and also the ability to print color or black and white. The print quality is also very good; another plus. The print quality is excellent and it is super fast compared to my old printer. Foot print is moderate. Epson print (remote printing via internet) is another fantastic feature that is very easy to set up and use.
