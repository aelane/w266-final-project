Wilson Jones View-Tab Transparent Dividers, Extra Wide, 5-Tab Set is perfect for creating lifetime binders storing reference materials. I use binders to help organize my home and business. When I attempted to put them in the standard binders I use, the tabs stick out from the binder. I have many binders that I use to hold certificates and original documents that I would rather not punch holes in. For me, these binders I use are often used as presentation materials and this just increases the professional look to it. I have several binders full of worksheet masters in page protectors. So I do not recommend these for binders that go through a lot of changes.Overall it's elegant and has a business-like appearance. I checked how they'd lay in several binders. In larger binders, the dividers are just fine. However, on some smaller binders, the tabs actually extend beyond the width of my binder. I am setting up binders of downloaded music, categorized by composer. Use with wide binders ideal. I wish they came with more than 5 or 8, for those really thick binders. They are ideally suited for binders you are making multiple copies of (sales presentations, leave-behinds, etc.)
