I am glad I got this workbook. I'm actually impressed with this workbook. I feel like this workbook is a good fit for him to explore on his own and it's fantastic for killing time while waiting for food to arrive at a restaurant.This is more than just a workbook or puzzle book. I am very happy with this workbook by Mead. All in all, a great little workbook and you can't beat the price. My 5-year-old is feeling appropriately challenged by this workbook. The other workbook (billed as grades 1-2 skills), is far too simple so far.I'm very impressed with this workbook and would definitely purchase from the Mead workbook series again. I used this workbook for children ages five and seven.

I can't praise this workbook enough!

the workbook not only has the usual exercises like charting simple household items using math language (e.g., 'in all') and word scrambles (e.g., a picture of a mouse with the letters "seumo"), but also sudoku-type puzzle grids, ven diagrams and logic problems (e.g., jenn does not have art on tues and thurs, she uses a ball for her wednesday activity, etc.

I received this workbook yesterday afternoon and gave it to my son last night.
