For the price and ease of installation, this has been a great printer. Be prepared to pay a premium price for genuine Epson if you want trouble free, quality prints. For the price especially, you really cannot ask for more. For the price - it's amazing.It's also super fast compared to my Cannon and super quiet.I've started recommending this to my friends - even though they may not do much printing - it's amazing how much you'll start printing once you have this super hero. If you can find a WorkForce 845 for about the same price, then definitely go with that as it's a better value.The WorkForce 3540 looks EXACTLY like WorkForce 845, with a few minor differences. At a price of $35-25 for all cartridges, this makes my WF-3540 by far the cheapest per page cost. AirPrint Compatible (C11CC33201)and knock about $50 off the price. And if price is an issue, certainly look at the WF-3520, or even the WF-2xxx line, for comparable quality at a lower price. Works well for the price I paid. With the 3540, the price is currently at $149.99 while the 3520 is at $131.99. So, unless the 3540 goes up in price anytime after this review, for $18 difference, I would go with the 3540 hands down!JUDGMENT CALL:The Epson WorkForce 3540 is may not be a dramatic step-up from the awesome WorkForce 845 in terms of printing.But in terms of functionality, the 3540 easily surpasses the 845 in terms of its ease of use for its LCD color touchscreen. Works well for the price I paid. It is roughly price equivalent with the WP-4530 from the small office line.
