They are now nicely protected and, because these protectors are acid free, I'm not worried about them being damaged.I also use them for crafting. I've seen, and used, heavier protectors but these get the job done just fine. They seem as thick as my other protectors. I have encountered protectors so thin they are like saran wrap, so maybe that's what they mean by heavy weight. I use sheet protectors a lot- for everything from my knitting patterns to recipes.Excellent quality. These protectors are called &#34;heavy weight&#34;, though they seem thinner than others I've used. I use sheet protectors regularly and for all kinds of reasons: business and school reports, recipes (easy to store and keeps them mess free), as an ad hoc dry erase refrigerator message center, storing and organizing patterns, swatches and instructions, etc. I particularly like these protectors because they are thick enough not to wrinkle or crease when bowed or slightly bent, but thin and flexible enough to fit into my ever changing knitting bags. These sleeve protectors are heavier-duty than the usual and the holes don't strain or stretch because they are full/heavy.At this point, I am in select, edit, and print mode. These protectors are great.

Some protectors have a &#34;hazy&#34; back.
