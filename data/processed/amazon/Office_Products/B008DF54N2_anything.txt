I've not had one come off of anything before I was ready to remove it. I did not think this would be anything special, but for anyone who loves labels, these are fantastic. There isn't anything not to like here. It's easy to write on with anything you have. This is great for labeling anything, and it should stay in place as long as you want, but remove easily when you don't want it. In short, I can't remember anything! What I love most is that it sticks to anything and removes without leaving that sticky residue behind - something you don't always get by using regular tape.NOTE: Do not get it wet. I seriously don't need to hunt for anything that I've written on in the middle of the night, so the color is a bit off-puting.It's a bit difficult to pull the tape through the end of the plastic carrier. It is very handy for labeling anything and everything, even items I put in the freezer and fridge - it still sticks! It's not going to stick forever, but it's good enough for anything that you would use a post-it note for. You are absolutely getting what you pay for... don't expect anything life altering.

Don't even bother using it on anything that has a curved edge.

I was intrigued by the Post-It Adhesive Roll as I previously hadn't seen anything like it.

If you are anything like me you have numerous so-called adhesive note pads and rolls and none seem to work when needed.
