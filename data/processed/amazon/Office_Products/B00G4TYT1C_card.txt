This card holder looks very sleek and much nicer in person than it does on the computer. And isn't that what you want in a card holder?? Its heavier than the plastic card holders, but still light. The card holder has two compartments, one at the top and one vertical space below. I had one of those cheap plastic card holders that lasted until it fell off the desk and broke. I glued it back together but it didn't look very professional.This card holder is much better than I anticipated. It weighed so much more than the other card holders I had paid substantially more for. One can easily just grab a card and hand it to someone, stuff in a card/letter, or whatever other need (maybe grab a few for a meeting or an interview). Swingline's clear, clean-looking acrylic card holder also has a horizontal spot perfect for note pads or post-its. I really like this card holder. The card holder comes with scratch paper in the bottom card holder and I think that is a great idea. One on the top which displays the card upright, also on the bottom at.
