If you've ever had to deal with these plastic covers sticking together due to static cling, you can really appreciate this. These covers are really durable, and perfect thickness for what I am using them for. These binding covers are made of a nice, durable plastic. They work great as binding covers buy they have so many other potential uses as well. Binding covers it beats me actually. These binder covers come in a large 100 count box and they are crystal clear and very professional. I selected these PET clear covers for reports, files, and documents, etc. You put one of these covers over your document, insert into the binding system (which will tell you which size strip to use), insert the binding strip on the side, and then your document is automatically bound.The price of these is reasonable. These are not the covers that fold over reports so that you can bind them on the side like the front and backs of a book - these are just sheets of thick 7 mil plastic that are dirty. Although these covers are not quite polish perfect, they still look great.As of my posting for this review, the product image shows binding covers with rounded corners; however, these covers are perfectly pointy rectangles.I am satisfied with the quality of the Fellowes PET Ultra Clear Binding Covers, and I do recommend these for important projects, or for personal documents with a long-term retention life, such as product manuals printed from PDF files. I would consider less costly, thinner covers if I intend to assemble documents that will be handled less often. The covers are nice and thick, and come packaged in a box with tissue paper separating each sheet. You can lay these covers over a worksheet and have your kid write on them using either a dry erase or washable marker. Love these binder covers. I now have enough covers to last a lifetime! These covers are competitively priced and the fact that they are recyclable means when the job is done and the cover is too dirty to re-use, it can go in our commingled recycling can with the paper.We don't use a binding system with these covers, we just staple them, so I can't comment on how well they work in that application, but for simple page protectors, they work very well. These are great covers - very sturdy and crystal clear. These binding covers are heavy duty and crystal clear. These covers are 7 mil thick, crystal clear and letter size. These covers add a nice touch.Another wonderful use for these sheets is to make your own stencils.
