Highly recommend this scanner. First, I love this scanner when it works. That being said, this scanner is a bargain at $400. So angle the scanner when it's open, if you need more space than you have, or turn it sideways. The scanner would fit inside it comfortably. It is the best scanner ever. This scanner is easy to install, only took about 5 minutes to set up. Fast duplex scanner. You do not need to renter scanner parameters each time you want a different profile. This scanner is quite small when the top and front are folded up, and not that much bigger when it's flipped open ready to scan.That leaves more space on my desk for the many piles of paper I bought this thing to scan.It handles full size pieces of paper and business cards - and comes with a separate business card database program.It comes with scanning software that asks you what application to send the scan to (like the included document storage program, or business card storage program).I read in a review here that a separate $100 program called Speedy Organizer would let me use it on multiple PCs on the network, so I bought it on Amazon with the scanner.Almost a year later I'm installing the scanner and software (I wouldn't need this if I was all that organized), and found that the $100 Speedy Organizer software won't install on my PC. This scanner is very easy to set up and use. That said, I love this scanner! It is amazing how insanely fast this scanner is.3. If you are looking for a powerful scanner at a mid-range price it is great, and I definitely recommend it for anyone who does a lot of scanning to PDF.
