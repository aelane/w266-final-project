I have always liked HP paper and this rivals it. The paper is stiff enough for borderless prints too. I recently ordered theCanon PIXMA Pro9000 Mark II Inkjet Photo Printer (3295B002)and needed some 4x6 paper to start printing things out.My wife is a teacher and is constantly dragging us to Target to make a few prints of her classroom, so the intention was to have this printer/paper combo replace that. The Photo paper plus looks great and seems to be a higher quality than most photolabs give us. Canon paper gives me best results with my Canon Pixma printer.I have tried several other papers along with the associated printer profiles, but cannot get the colors as good as I do with Canon paper. Costco paper comes second, so I often use it for proofs and then get the final print printed on Canon paper. This paper is just as good as, perhaps better than, the old Plus Glossy. This is a premium paper and it feels that way, very heavy weight, nice gloss, takes the ink well with no bleed. This Canon paper is of a superb quality, and the price is unbelievable! My Canon Pro 10 has a paper setting for it (and profile via the Canon site) so that makes printing all the easier. This paper is great, I use it all the time.However, like all Canon ink & paper products, the price keeps going up and the products are getting harder to find. I had some off-brand photo paper I had gotten at the dollar store, but it just didn't work in my new printer like it had in the old one. This is a fine well-priced glossy paper, perfect for 4 x 6 prints. The paper is a good solid weight for this size print; 275gsm (or 73 pound) makes for a print that will stand up to a bit of rough handling. It isn't fine art paper thick, but at this price point, I never expected that.The paper is solid neutral white. This Canon paper will probably last a long time, but it is not designed to last the amount of time those other papers will last.Canon did a great job with the packaging of this paper. The paper reminds me of Kodak F photographic paper before it was finished on a ferrotype plate.This paper is far better than store brand paper - like Staples, Costco, or Office Max. The glossy paper consistently produces a bright, clean, pleasing and lasting image. Excellent paper for our canon ix6520 printer. This works perfectly in the rear paper feed. However, the 4x6 Canon paper was well worth the money, the colors were bright, and the drying time was about an hour.When I say "drying time," I'm addressing the time that the print remains too tacky to put into an album or frame. It is cannon photo paper. I find Epson paper to be the most compatible photo paper overall, it prints well on Epson and Canon printers. I used HP photo paper on Epson and Canon and the ink doesn't dry/catch that well on either, it prints fine on its own HP.Canon Photo Paper Plus Glossy III had great success with the same paper on the 4x6 size, so I decided to get this for 8.5x11; after myEpson Premium Glossy 8 1/2 x 11 Inch Photo Paper 20 Count (S041286)went out. I been using Epson paper on a Canon i950 (got canon MP560 also), because I used to have a couple of older Epson printers. Sadly this paper while looking good didn't have the wow factor that I got from the Epson Premium Glossy. In the larger format paper sizes, they always feel thinner simply because of the surface area. I was worried the paper thickness was too much for the printer. The paper is a good weight-- doesn't curl up like some other (thinner) papers, and I don't notice any fading on my photos-- even the ones that have been sitting out uncovered for a couple of years. Canon photo paper is simply the best paper to use for your photos. I have used this photo paper for years and have always been pleased with it. Photo paper is usually pricey in the local stores, so I buy mine online (Amazon!) The paper is packaged nicely, protected in a nice box, with cardboard inserts on each side of the paper deck, in a resealable plastic bag. I recommend keeping the paper in the sealed plastic and in the box while it's on your shelf waiting for use. This is excellent paper for the price, but I can't justify giving it 5 stars as long as the Pro Platinum paper exists. Love how this photo paper works with my Cannon photo printer- Haven't had one jam and my pictures look awesome- Great photo paper!! This is my favorite photo paper. I'm happy with this paper. I use this paper with my Pixma pro9000 and genuine Canon inks and it is FANTASTIC. This paper and my Canon printers were MADE for each other and it shows. This is good paper if you have a Canon printer and the price is certainly better than you can buy it locally. Great paper Canon paper is some of the best. I got paper for $12.99 which I think is not bad for 100 4x6,20 5x7,20 8x11 good deal. This paper works very well for my photo printing needs. I really like this paper for my Canon printer. I use the heavier weight paper for photos that are going to be handled repeatedly. It's hard to review photo paper since one of the key qualities is how prints will hold up over time. But using this paper with my Canon Pixma MX850 printer produces just stunning images. I have used this paper for several years. I have used the Canon paper in Canon, HP, and Epson and got great results with each. This is superb photo paper. This paper is part of a carefully engineered system which includes the Cannon inks. I tried other paper and this is better. It is expensive compared to plain or cheap paper but it is worthwhile if you want pictures that really pop! Having pre-cut 4x6 paper is fantastic for those rare occasions when we want to share prints. This paper is great quality and easy to use - just as I've found with all products by Canon. I use this paper with my Canon Pixma 970 printer. With this paper my pictures have excellent color and clarity. This photo paper works good. I don't believe the paper differs much between brands. I've used Brother, Canon and HP paper usually. Is it the paper or the printer, though.
