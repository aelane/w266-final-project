In 1980, Post-it notes hit market, and quickly became a fixture in any office. These notes stick on better, and stay longer. I take notes on them. These new  full adhesive post-it notes are super sticky because the entire back is stick aside from one meager line at the bottom that isn't sticky. I love these Post-It notes! These are the best sticky notes I've had so far!And let me tell you why:These are made of a different texture than most sticky notes. Now I don't really want to go back to regular sticky notes. I do not know how it would feel writing on these sticky notes with a junky pen - I do not plan to find out. Parchment-like sticky notes! Ever tried to use sticky notes to organize a bunch of stuff, only to be defeated when half the notes fall off? These Post-it notes have adhesive on all  but about a 3/8 inch strip on one side and are great when you need something that will stick and stay put. These notes are technically not full adhesive as the bottom 1/2" is not. Post-It notes are obviously very useful in many ways. I think that regular post-it notes are useful in most situations, but if you need something that will stay in place, give these a try. I love post-it notes I use them at work and at home - anything to help with organization. What I love about these post-it notes - the whole note is sticky. For those of you who use sticky notes in the car - these work great - don't fall off. For those that have had notes fall off or get torn away - the really is an important trait and I wonder why this hasn't come on the market sooner. They are so nice for putting notes on anything- notebooks and on the wall even. The notes stick very well, but are not so sticky that they will damage the book's pages. I use these for posting notes all over the house for my teenage son. 3M's Post-it notes are a reliable, familiar, well-established brand. That makes them quite innovative in that one can write notes and stick them to just about anything: paper, CDs, doors, plastic containers, windows, whatever. But when I am adding notes to a book or working on a paper I don't want to worry that they will come off just when i was searching for them. The Post-It Super Sticky Full Adhesive notes are another quality product from 3M. I have tried Avery Sticky notes. I *LOVE* writing encouraging notes to people and posting them in random places for them to see. So when I saw these new full adhesive notes were available for me to try through the Amazon Vine program, I grabbed them right away!They are the same size and color combo that are offered on the older version, but boy, these stick just great! If you haven't tried these adhesive notes you should. Regular Post-It notes only have a strip of adhesive on the back, which is perfectly fine for most uses, but fall off if you carry the item around, put it on your bag, etc. I've also had sticky notes like this that have adhesive on 100% of the back...those are GREAT for labeling boxes, etc (where you want the note to be stuck long-term to the item), but a bit difficult to take off of the pad, reposition, or peel off of the item when you're done with it. These notes are much more sticky than the ones that limit the adhesive to the edges. Leaving notes for each other on the fridge got a lot easier and more effective. These are what they say they are - sticky notes with adhesive that covers the entire back surface (except the bottom edge, so you can get them off the pad one at a time). While the notes with the adhesive only along one edge can easily "flap" and get pulled off, these stay in place until I am ready to remove them. These notes are larger in size (3x3 inches) with plenty of room for a detailed note. I use these to make little notes and mark spots in my reading that I'd like to refer to later. If you want some really great and really sticky Post-it notes, these are the best. These Post-it notes stick really great and never curled up. I make notes on the same page, I do not like to mark up books so these are perfect. I just make my notes and the note sticks to the page, not just part of the note but 90% of the note so it does not flap around.These are perfect for the one that cooks the meals does the crafting, schoolwork, use on textbooks it is great for making notes on anything you do not want to mark up.I can go on and on but you get the idea.N
