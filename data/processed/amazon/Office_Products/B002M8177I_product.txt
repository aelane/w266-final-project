This product is also a bit better than using an average Post-It note because it comes in a one-size fits all package as each note comes perforated and the 3x7.5 can be divided further into pieces.Having given a glowing review thus far, I must also caution against the sensibility of using these notetabs  continuously. This product would, however, be quite useful for reports and such. First of all, I wasn't quite sure, how well these would work, so I was skeptical they would be a product, I would use. Despite product information that indicates they are compatible with most writing instruments, my ultra fine Sharpies tended to smudge and ball points work best when no finger has touched the surface ~ an impossibility given the design. So when you reuse it you will not be able to see through the product as well as the first time you used it. The product description is quite accurate, and it's simply a very nice idea. I would have given it three - but the product is very, very good - I just have no use for it.I keep trying to figure out what this product would be good for? LOLFor me this product fell into the "if we build it you will find a purpose for it" category. Other than that I find this to be the most versatile NoteTab product and will definitely get more in the future. I also thought these might be a good product to use at work with all the paperwork I do. I will definately buy this product again. I am already using this product in a variety of ways.I am using it to mark pages in books that I am reading, for later reference. This product is certainly not something I have use for. I received this product as a part of the Vine Program. The product does exactly what it is supposed to do, which is to act as a tab and a post it to write on. If this is the product you need, it will do an excellent job, although I think it is somewhat overpriced. If this is the type product you are looking for and you have a use for it, it would do an excellent job. I would rather buy a product that can be recycled.Husbands review:He shared the stack of NoteTabs with his group of Engineers. A super product. Not much to sayabout this product. All in all this is a great product and I will continue to use it in my organizer. With this product I can make my notes directly in the book without damaging the pages or covering anything up! I expect to be using this product a lot in the future. Avery has done it again with producing another great product in there NoteTabs. I don't think that this product is going to be as popular as the others in their new series of products. This new Avery product has potential to do lots of great stuff. Could also be an interesting product for scrapbooking. This was a dandy product to come across. Good product. Why does this particular product not rate a re-sealable zipper?LIST OF ADVANTAGES. The present product requires a time-consuming thought process, "Do I want a long sticky, or do I want a short sticky? But this particular product has two colors (blue; green) and has two conformities of sticky (no tab; plus tab).

Overall I thought the product was good for what I used it for but not a "must have" staple in office supplies.

This product is going to come in very handy for me.

They stick well and remove easily, and really, what more can you say about a product than that it works well for its intended purpose?
