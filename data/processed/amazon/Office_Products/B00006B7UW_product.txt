So be warned, this is a handy, very useful product; but, unless you use it continually, you will need to assemble and disassemble the parts to move it to and from your desk. This product works exactly as you'd expect it to, it holds your books up with no fuss. I got this product for my wife who was complaining about losing her place in cookbooks while working. When I got this product I realized it was extremely heavy and complex to put together. This is a very nice looking, well designed product. I'll admit, I didn't notice when I ordered it that it is 18" wide, although it is clearly stated in the product description. This product weighs a ton, or at least way more than a document holder made for sheets of paper. Granted many weren't as attractive as the 3M product but what price design for such an item. I just can't review this product favorably. When you spend this much on a stationery product, it really should be beyond compare. This 3M product is really fantastic, and I wish I had gotten one of these years ago! This is a good product that works but the poor instruction manual made it hard to assemble. First of all, I LOVE this product. This is a very useful product.
