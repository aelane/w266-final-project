This is a 2-inch binder that ends up being closer to a 3-inch binder after taking into account the outside zipper and padded cover. If you open the main binder zipper, you can also get to the expandable file area and also a couple of small inner pockets, along with whatever you've clicked into the three-ring binder section.I liked the idea of this binder better than the actuality. I have been using this binder at my office for about a week now, and I simply love it. The three-ring binder part holds enough paper for an entire novel (for me) and then some.This notebook has a place for my regular, ruled paper (which means cheap, endless refills) plus a great pocket area with dividers and tabs that I can slip labels into. This is much more important (at least to me) than you might initially think, because I travel and this means I can just grab this one binder and have everything I need and the zippers keep it all secure. This is a nice, large binder. The bottom one is larger and contains 3 binder rings. Overall, this is a nice zippered binder that appears to be well made. This binder has a zipper that does not close all the way. This attractive binder is great for transporting files in the 6-pocket expanding files. I filled this binder with my 36 tab divided papers and threw the checkbook and a few other supplies in the handy inside pockets. I switched to another binder. Overall I don't know how practical a bulky binder like this would be for an on-the-go student. The Five Star 2&#34; Zipper Binder is a mixed-bag.Pros: The binder is attractive with the darker stripped print on the outer pocket. For me, the binder is nice for use for bill-paying and storage at home, but not something I'd lug back and forth as it was clearly intended for school, not work (particularly in the brighter blue color). I used this binder to transport my class materials to my German classroom which is in another part of the school from my regular room. The binder feels very durable and is guaranteed to last for "all" year.The capacity of it is pretty big. So this binder has more capacity than most students will ever need. This binder is simply HUGE. The Five Star Zipper Binder is great if you're looking for a binder that will protect your pages from all angles as all the pages will be zipped into one containable pack. Once my binder was filled up - not all the way, just with maybe 70 papers and some pens, and some additional dividers, when I carried it I really don't have quite enough slack in the handle to make it comfortable. This Mead binder has been a good choice for that. And as my binder has gained items, it's been nice to have the handle on the spine with which to carry it if necessary. I love this all in one binder. This binder will replace about eight items on the upcoming back to school list, and my 12-year old son is thrilled to have it! I would highly recommend this binder over several of the cheapie 1 1/2&#34; and 2&#34; plastic binders you'll spend more on anyway. This binder has everything! I received this binder for reviewing purposes, had I purchased it from Amazon I would return it (within the 30 day return window). This is a nice looking Zipper binder and color looks true to the picture. I threw a whole other binder into the main portion and it had room left over.-Cheap (as in price). This is a large binder both in measurement and in thickness but it seems very sturdy and I think it will last a while.The front pocket has a sorting file pocket. This binder has some great features, the most notable being the expandable accordion style folder that is built in and which can be accessed from either the inside or the outside of the binder. This is a binder that tries to carry everything. The binder part looks sturdy with both sides protected with a thick plastic lining on the inside. This binder is just okay. And, the binder itself opens and closes smoothly. I'd pass on this binder for school. It's tidier and looks a little more polished than carrying a separate binder and stacks of paper, but the fabric covering is more casual than a briefcase.If you tend to carry around the same files, but need access to a lot of paper or reference papers, this is an ideal way to tidily transport them rather than carry around separate pieces. The Five Star binder is a nice way to keep all your papers and notes together and in order. I think this is a really great binder. He needs a 2" binder, tab dividers, flash cards, index cards, calculator, expo markers and 2 one subject notebooks. This binder will hold all of that and then some. I do like this binder, it is tough and a nice color.
