We have used these ink cartridges for several years and have never experience any problems with them. Canon PGI-220 Ink Tank / B001CSMJKII bought this ink tank for use with myCanon PIXMA MX860 Wireless All-In-One office Printer. The ink tank fits, works well, and prints cleanly. I don't find that we got through the ink all that fast. I only use Canon ink in my Canon printer. The Canon ink is very reasonable and you only buy the colors that run out. It is the same ink and works fine on my MX-860 But I suspect they are putting less ink in these days. While I hate buying ink all the time for inkjet printers, I have found my Canon iP4600 an excellent printer to be outstanding. The ink cartridges for my Canon seem to last longer than those for my prior Epsons and HPs. Although it is not the cheapest, Canon ink cartridges are still top rated. Black ink is the color used most often and this product will last for a while. I always purchase my ink from here. This ink works fine in my printer. Get the Generic ink unless you want really good quality for photos. It's ink. I do not buy refill ink or compatible ink. Only OEM Genuine Canon ink. I've used Canon ink for several years and recommend it to others. The ink is real Canon and the prices are great. I've tried some of those re-fillable ink cartridges, but they are just not as good as the Name Brand cartridges are, so I always buy Name Brand and never use the re-filled cartridges. The ink pops in and out of the printer easily. My local Wal-Mart no longer sells this Canon ink. Buying the ink online is so much easier than having to run to one store than another. I always buy my ink on Amazon because the price is so good and I live in a rural area where it's not easy to find printer ink. This black ink has been going strong for me, and is lasting a good while, but to be honest, I don't do a whole lot of printing each day. Provides Canon approved ink and interface. They are the ink tanks that go in the printer I have, i have no other choice, therefore they gotta be great Canon ink is very good but much too expensive and I seem to be ordering it often. You will spend much more on the ink over the years than the printer will cost.I couldn't be without a printer so I'll be buying these until the printer dies. I don't know if the ink in other brands will last longer or is less expensive as I've not done comparative shopping in the area. Amazon was super, as usual, but I hate having to spend this much on ink!

Very good ink.

These come with an LED that blinks and indicates how much ink is left, which blinks faster with less ink.

The ink lasts forever and I get great printing results from all Canon inks I use.
