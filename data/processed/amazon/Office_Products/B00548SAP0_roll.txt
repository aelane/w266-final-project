That's about as much as you can ask of a roll of packaging tape. This is a nice roll of heat resistant packing tape. I had a cheap roll of store brand packing tape that would lift so easily that I had to wrap tape around the entire box to make sure it wouldn't let go. When I removed the roll ofScotch Light Duty Packaging Tape 610 Clear Heat Resistantfrom the package, I first thought of the tape of my childhood and the red plaid tab on the free end made me tear up for a second. To call this particular roll light duty may be significantly understated. This roll fits into a three inch core dispenser I use for rolls of one quarter inch cellophane tape. This roll definitely fills a necessary gap between sizes. This is a nice big roll of tape. It is also easy to take off the roll when you don't put a piece of paper at the end of it.
