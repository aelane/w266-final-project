I will be buying more in other colors. Bright colors show up even in the dark (not that you would read in the dark...) The different colors let you categorize what you're marking and they are ultra secure, strong and they remove easily. I will have to see if they have different colors available as well, as it would be nice to have a selection of maybe 6-8 colors to choose from. However, if you prefer softer colors, these are available in a wide variety of colors. The colors are bright and easy to see. I like the more neon colors of these labels, easier to see in my planner since they are bright.You will need to write small where the colored part of the divider is. colors are bright, tab is stiff and sufficiently sticky to lead me to believe it will hold up over time. I can employ different colors for different topics and as I already mentioned, they are very easy to reposition.These tabs are great not only for cookbooks but would also be great for academic use or everyday reading. I do wish they came in more colors in the same pack, though. The colors are pretty close to the blue and pink highlighters.Why I likes these:* substantial adhesive surface to keep the tab fixed on the page* the clear part of the tab is...well...clear, and does not obscure the text underneath* the tab has a textured surface so you can write on the tab with ink or pencil (not the exposed backside of the color tab, which is smooth)* sticky enough to stay, readily removable (I would be careful on very thin paged books, like bibles or similar when removing, no problem on my textbooks)* the combination of the adhesion and the thickness of the tab material let you flip sections using the tabsThey offer a variety of sizes, including some that are shaped like a bookmark with a tab at the top. Only two colors come in the pack, so you'll have to buy more than one package to get a full range of colors.2.

It would be much better if Avery offered 4 or more colors per pack.Aside from that, these tabs are a great choice.

Both colors are very nice.The downside for me is that they are SO thick.

They are available in several colors and can be written on easily.
