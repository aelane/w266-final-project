And the box looks quite neat when you are done.They are a bit expensive at nearly $0.25 per label. But since we only use them when the box has lots of labels and barcodes, our first package is lasting a long time. The box is ready to go. If the box is solid brown, that really won't be an issue. The box looks tidy, the proper label is visible and the old ones aren't.They should have invented these years ago...... It does make the box look like a patchwork box, but hey it allows you to reuse boxes which saves money. It shows up well on the box and, especially once you have stamps or a postage meter strip on the box, it's easy to see which end is up, so no problems there. I've even dis-assembled a box and re-constructed it inside out. These are made for placing on a brown box for shipping. You can pay $2 for a box at Staples or just do the green thing and scrounge around for something else. I actually like the white on the box to stand out as a label, but I guess that is a preference thing. I ship a box at least every month or so, and instead of buying boxes, I've often wished I could reuse other boxes in which I get shipments.
