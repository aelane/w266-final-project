The file appears to be strong enough to handle my home filing; however, it might be a bit lightweight for office use. The file will also not fit in a standard file drawer. Buy, file here, then hold for a month to be sure I don't have to return anything. The NEW Stadium file system is really great. This unique file is a perfect solution for my requirements. The tiered file allows you to easily see your documents and the sturdy construction keeps them securely in place. The file comes with labels, with a nice selection of pre-printed titles. I've stuffed the file full of documents, and there are no signs of tearing on any of the sides.All in all, Smead's stadium file is a great way to organize the paperwork in your life. The Smead tiered file is a handy solution for organizing household or office paperwork in a limited space.It does not stand on its own right out of the wrapper, but once it has a chance to expand on its own and you get some papers in it it does just fine.Speaking of papers, the bottoms of the partitions are tiered as well, so the top of the papers are always within 1/4" of the top of the partition. What I like best about this particular file is that it doesn't take up a lot of room and doesn't take a day to set up or manage. This file system is sturdier than it looks, and doesn't leave a big footprint on my desk. The file can be filled until it reaches an 8" depth. the actual file spaces seem sturdy enough, but I hate snagging on them as I try to pull documents out and shove them back in. When this file first arrived it was packaged flat and - as other reviewers have mentioned - it took quite a bit of pulling and stretching to get it to stand in place.Bottom line:  Nice design, but materials are questionable for extended use. This is an accordian file holder for letter sized documents. I am happy with the accordion-style stand-up file. and the file is tiered so it is easy to see which categories you have labeled the tiers with. It is relatively easy to see which file is which, and so everyone here likes that. Love this file! This is a really sturdy 12-pocket file holder.
