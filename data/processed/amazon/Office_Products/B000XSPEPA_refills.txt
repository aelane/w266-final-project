The refills are a little pricey for this guy but sometimes, well, life comes at you way too fast and these conveniences are worth the extra change. * Tape refills are expensive. Sometimes the refills are stuck together, but that has only happened once. I don't know that I have ever seen refills for this type of dispenser at a local easy-access discount store, but maybe at an office store or a craft store you could find some. The refills aren't that expensive, especially if I pick them up at Walmart. I'm glad they have refills for it though or I don't think it would be worth it. If you can find the refills on sale though, that might make it worth it. So I set out to purchase some refills. I wish it came with more refills. You might want to get some refills before you bring this product home. For me, I don't think it's worth it and probably won't be buying any refills. The refills are a little expensive for everyday use, but for gift wrapping or any time you need tape and three hands, this thing is great. And the refills are a bit expensive, so I don't know how cost effective it is: I would say it all comes down to paying the extra money vs. the ease of use & convenience it provides!Personally I'm happy with the cheaper regular tape, either in the regular plastic dispensers, or in the heavier, office weighted dispensers: both ways are reasonably easy-to-use, even when wrapping Christmas presents: and you can always prepare a piece of tape or two & stick them to the side of the dispenser to grab while wrapping: that's what I usually do...so I would recommend this as a neat product, but on the expensive side, and not amazing... I'll certainly also be needing to invest in refills. So I will buy refills and get plently of use out of this. It's great, and the refills are easy to find at the office store. I actually found refills for the holder at a local dollar store (3 refills for a buck--perfect!). Because I now have so many refills, I will continue to use the popup tape dispenser. Had I not found the refills, I am not sure I would have sought them out in order to continue to use it. I also think the refills are a bit expensive compared to regular tape.
