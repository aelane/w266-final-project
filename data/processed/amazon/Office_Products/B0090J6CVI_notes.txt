It contains some sticky notes, arrow labels for marking pages, plastic moveable page dividers, a sturdy pocket in the front, and another one, divided into 2 sections, in the back.My first thought when opening the package was: this is an awful lot of plastic for a spiral notebook. That's not bad, but these are not Post-It sticky notes. Sticky notes. No more sideway notes! Very good for separating notes! The sticky notes and tab are excellent ways of marking the place in a book, giving a quick note for groceries to the hubby or when sending a gift in the mail. They can take notes or jot down reminders. It comes with little sticky notes and sticky tabs as well, which as a lover of office supplies, I liked very much. Why not leave the sticky notes out of it, and lower the price by a dollar?

I have ADD and my notes are always chaotic.

It's very handy.I also like that it comes with post-it notes and flags right there, ready for your use.

There are sufficient 'post-it' notes and flags.
