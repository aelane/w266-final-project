I was unimpressed with this product. I love this product! I used this product to color coat the plastic food containers in my fridge. This product is great because you can not only color code the items of your choice but you can also write or print what you would like on the labels. This is a versatile product with loads of uses. I think I goofed and the product description threw me... "Write labels by hand or print with laser and inkjet printers"A word of advice- make sure you choose the labels that suit the type of printer you have.I see that "laser" was in the title, but as someone who labels and relabels during organization binges, I must have assumed I wouldn't bother printing anything temporary, as I usually only commit to a printed label once I am 100% sure of what I am labeling.Anyway, the colors are bold 1980's neon. I highly recommend this product. this product works like it's supposed to, and the removable quality of the labels is completely awesome. I reviewed another Post-It product, the Post-it(R) Super Sticky Removable File Folder Labels, 0.6 x 3.4 Inches White, going into detail about experiments I did with this line of products for use in food storage. This color-coded product works the same. Just like the product name indicates, the labels are sticky and removable. Leave it to post-it to come up with such a great product! This is a great product! Overall I am very satisfied with this product. Another great product from Post Its! This product is a quick and an eye-catching solution to help with organization; they can also be used as address labels, though I probably wouldn't consider them "Super Sticky" enough to label items going into the mail. the product works well with inkjet printers. I used this product in school with my students, using them to label their review folders front and back with their names. They are an excellent, useful product. Be careful; this product is for laser printers only; the instructions say there are versions for ink-jet, and versions for both, but I couldn't find those. Great product with really strong adhesive yet removable! Another useful and practical product from Post-it! There is not much to say about this product other than the fact that it does what it is supposed to. Very stable and easy to remove when you want to reorganize.Very happy with this product. I really thought I would like this product. This product works on plastic bins, better than Avery's removable labels do.I would recommend this product over those.I didn't try to use this product in a computer, so I can't comment on that.Still, it could be more sticky and reusable. So it's a good product.
