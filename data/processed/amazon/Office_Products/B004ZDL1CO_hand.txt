It also permits those of us who enjoy producing a "lovely hand" to do it better, leaving behind a nice even stroke. I have a relatively small hand with short fingers and I like the way this pen is tapered and I like its size. They write smoothly, boldly and cleanly, and feel good in my hand. They are easy to hold, and write absolutely well with your hand. They are comfortable in the hand. It seems that your hand just glides along the paper when you use these. These also seem to lessen hand fatigue for me during extended use.Overall, a much more improved Paper Mate pen than past Paper Mate pens. I mean use my hand and a pen to write, not type at a computer and call it writing. I don't have a heavy hand, so it's nice to have pens that you don't have to push that hard on paper and have it still write well.

I also want them to be comfortable in my hand, so that my hand doesn't feel pain while I write.

They feel great in your hand.
