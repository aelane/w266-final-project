The colors are nice, especially for contrast with darker inks (blue/black). As always, I love the bright colors - they help me stay organized! As said, it tends to curl.I do like the varied colors, except the icky green,  and the fact that the paper is recycled is a big plus.Would I buy them ... probably not, there are other brands that stick longer. The colors are fun, too. The colors are all day-glow: Orange, Green, and Pink. The colors were good, after all (though red pen doesn't work on the pink ones), and paper quality was fine. And I love these bright colors. I do really like that the colors are bright and easy to spot. Love the colors! I love the colors of these post it notes. The bright colors are a plus for red flagging items but softer colors would work just as well. They also come in bright colors, which make them hard to miss! Because of the colors they come in I can't easily overlook them and therefore writing notes to myself using these sticky notes is quite helpful. In shocking, eye-catching colors! The colors are bright, yet pleasing to the eye...much more to my taste than the "yellow kind". The bright colors will require markers that offer a bold, dark contrast, but, overall, this product makes a worthy competitor to that offered by the competition.
