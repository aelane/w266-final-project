This is the easiest set of markers I have ever opened! I enjoyed using this set of BIC Mark-it Ultra fine markers because they allowed me to add a lot of details to my drawings.The tips are very fine, and allow smooth writing. This Bic set of markers has 36 bright vibrant colors, the writing is very smooth and the price reasonable. I have the fine set as well as the ultra fine and the ultra fine have more of a pen like tip. I used this set for art purposes. I'm on my second set and I am especially opinionated regarding pens. This set, at under $20., provides three dozen color choices, and with ultra-fine points it's easy to make detailed charts and artwork. This set is, of course, new to me, but my (black) BIC markers have always lasted a long time, so I expect these will as well.The rubber grips make these markers easy to hold and use, but note that they are "permanent" markers, and are not for use by small children unless permanent decoration of the environment isn't a problem. I really love this set of pens. This set of permanent colored markers is wonderful for several reasons. This is a great set. Seriously, just love this set. Having this set is like have a rainbow at your fingertips! If I had to pick one set, it would be the Ultra Fine set. I imagine I'll get it figured out eventually, but I would have rated this set five stars if they'd gotten this right.

Amazon, you've truly outdone yourself!This set has me thinking of creative ways to brighten up ordinary writing opportunities.

That set is probably best for more quick or casual doodling needs, but coordinates with the Ultra Fines (same palette) for maximum versatility.

This is a nice set of pens in 36 different colors.
