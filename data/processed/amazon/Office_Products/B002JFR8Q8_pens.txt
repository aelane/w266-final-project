These pens have been around for years, so this is not ground-breaking technology, just an old, trusty pen that works well. I remember these pens when I was a little girl, my dad used to have them. I LOVE these pens since they make it so much easier for me to color code things such as my calendar. I was excited to see these 4-Color Bic pens, I ALWAYS had these when I was a teen. I was happy to see these pens offered on Vine, but was a little worried they'd be cheap and useless.To my surprise, these pens seem quite sturdy. These pens are truly FUN to use and I do recommend them to everyone. I love having it again, as having four pens in one at my fingertips helps with budgeting, balancing the checkbook and such.Who am I kidding? *A Good Gift*So, it seems to me that one of these pens would be the perfect gift for all but the most cynical and jaded elementary school kid from a kind hearted honorary aunt or uncle.As a practical matter, I'm much likely to keep a few different color pens on my desk than to use one of these, but gosh they remain fun.Recommended. I've loved these pens since I was a kid and got some for the first time in years. Overall, these pens are a great value! I remember having these pens as a kid and loving them. I remember these pens as a kid! Overall these pens are just as I remember, but possibly even better because they don't seem to jam up like they used to. These are just really fun pens to have around. These pens have taken over 30 years off my life. I began using these pens over 20 years ago for home, and office. These pens were always packed in my canvas bag for work, as I needed them frequently for chart work, and outlining. Now, they are go-to pens for whether I change colors to indicate a specific persons comments in a meeting, to whether a dot means that a task is pending or completed or to write then edit something - a color changing pen comes in handy. These iconic pens bring back all kinds of memories for me. Overall, these pens are great for someone who wants the flexibility of having multiple colors easily at hand. In the past, I have three pens nested inside my business planner (red, blue, and green) so that I can easily see different customer notes. Normally, with new pens, I've found that I had to scribble on something prior to using it for the first time. These are inexpensive pens, so don't expect too much. I like these pens because they remind me of the ones I had as a kid. I absolutely love these pens. I hadn't used one of these pens since the 90's and the pens are much thinner than what I remembered them be. These pens work well in terms of mechanism. I think these pens have been around for years, and they still do the job. I like these pens as I can set off marks on drawings and documents. No broken pens thus far.
