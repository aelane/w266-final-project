I can say one thing particular to this brand - the labels are really "super sticky" as it says on the package and held better than other similar brands I tried. The great thing about these post it labels is they stick securely, but if you wish to update the label or re-use the folder they also remove cleanly without destroying the paper tab or sticking another label over the old label. The one thing that none of my previous labels could do is be removed cleanly. The one thing that I would have liked more about this product is that if it could have been in different colors just like different color files or folders for differentiating when you are using these labels for organizing files. One thing they (she and her partner) need is fast access of printed file evidence.These little labels make that job much easier and they don't fall off like the post it notes they had been using! Not wanting to waste a thing, I've also used the outer edge of sticky paper with handwritten words since the printer will not sufficiently print on that space. The only thing issue with that is that after re-using 3 or 4 times, the layers of labels stuck on top of each other can look messy and unprofessional especially when you are being audited.I tried these and have to say there is no real difference between it and the Avery brand. Just the right thing for "semi-permanent" use. (I know that seems like a small thing, but providing reusable packaging is one of the details that 3M always seems to get right.

If there is one thing I really dislike, it's having to scrub labels off of bottles before they can be reused for the next batch.

It's designed to do one thing, and it does it perfectly.

The first thing I noticed is that on the label sheets they were kind enough to include the corresponding Avery Template number that is used with Microsoft word.
