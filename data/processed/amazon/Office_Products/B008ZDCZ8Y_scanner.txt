I then attached and powered up the scanner, but the computer didn't automatically pull up the control screen. I then added the scanner application icon to my dock for easy access. This scanner offers a lot of features that I have not used yet. The Epson Perfection Color Photo Scanner is a sleek modern looking scanner. I've been using this scanner for over a month and am extremely happy with it. I bought an Epson scanner a couple of years ago and it didn't work right out of the box, so I switched to a Canon scanner that has been working well for me, although I don't like the software that came with it. It shouldn't be this hard to set up a scanner. Manhandle this scanner and you'll be out $99 real quick. This scanner was really easy to setup. Considering this scanner is $100 and includes that software, this scanner seems like a really great deal to me!I have been having so much fun scanning and then "stitching" large photos together. This scanner offers a variety of options like scanning in pictures or document, slides and negatives, as well as being able to scan oversized documents.It was easy to set up and download. The scanner itself is very simple and easy to hook up. This scanner is energy star certified and operates with LED to make it very energy efficient. My old scanner had to warm up when you first turned it on but that is not necessary with this scanner. This is definitely a larger scanner and I found the software clunky for use with my Mac and Lion (OS X v 10.8.2). But if this scanner only had that.Ultimately, I would recomend this scanner for most people. Epson and Canon are the big scanner makers, but scanners for old film slides are a different animal than paper scanners for business. The Epson V370 is quite a feature-rich scanner for its rather moderate price. Overall I like this scanner a lot - for under 100 bucks one gets a machine that does a lot, and does it well. This scanner presents a nice balance of quality, performance, and price, delivering quick and accurate scanning of text, photos, and even bulky items for right around the hundred dollar price point. This scanner works great when trying to archive photographic prints and slides. its relatively compact and I like that the scanner opens from the side rather than the back so it fits in a tighter space like a cabinet. I set this scanner up on a windows 7 computer with no problems. Every other flatbed scanner that I have or have owned has a cover that is hinged on the short axis and thus opens away from you if the scanner is positioned with the short axis facing you (which minimizes the amount of space it takes up on my desk). With my own dedicated scanner sitting next to me I've stepped it up a notch in my battle against stacks of paper. Photo scans turn out great as well.This scanner was easy to setup and easy to use. This Epson V370 scanner and software achieve remarkably good results, particularly for its low price which is achieved in part via fairly cheap feeling plastic construction. This is a very good scanner. The scanner cover is heavy enough to press the photo down tight enough against the glass which some scanners don't do well. The Perfection V370 Color Photo Scanner provides an excellent scanner at an affordable price. The scanner does not list Windows 8 compatibility but there was no major problems here as well. Good, basic scanner. When our old scanner gave up the ghost, I knew I wanted to get her a good quality name brand and Epson is certainly that. I picked up this scanner specifically for a project to digitize a huge cache of old (1940s-1980s) family photos in various states of disrepair. The Epson Perfection V370 Color Photo Scanner is a compact, easy to install and use scanner. I was very excited about receiving this scanner, and I have not been let down. The scanner also comes with cables for a mac and PC, so that way everybody in the house can use it. Maybe that's why I'm so impressed with how much scanner you get with an Epson V370, without spending a lot of money.If you're investing a lot of time in scanning photographs, or otherwise need good quality scans, a scanner is not the place to cut corners. This is a relatively compact, lightweight scanner from Epson that does a fine job for most home-use needs. I remember my first scanner nearly 20 years ago... You could lift the scanner from its base and lay it on whatever you wanted to scan, viewing the "whatever" >>through the scanner&lt;&lt;. I know of no other scanner that offers this feature -- it is sorely missed (especially as stitching software makes large-area scans practical). )If I were buying an inexpensive scanner for a small office, I'd go with the Epson, as the Canon seems more-likely to be damaged by careless users -- especially by being knocked off the desk. There is merely good or bad scanner >>software&lt;&lt;."

Neither scanner has an automatic document feeder, so you won't be hand-feeding 100 pages without some fatigue.

But if the scanner does not have a hinged lid designed for objects thicker than a piece of paper, it will be a major inconvenience to scan a book or a 3D object (I've scanned remote controls, artwork, school projects, etc.).

The new Perfection V370 is an extremely accurate scanner that has the ability (albeit with some fine tuning) to deliver spot on clones of photos and other materials that you need to digitize.
