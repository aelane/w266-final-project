What I do to save ink is change my printer settings to "fast draft"... the cartridges last much longer that way. After purchasing ink cartridges at various on line suppliers and sometimes either returning them or throwing them out because they are dried out, I have gone back to buying HP ink cartridges for my HP5610 and have switched from Office Depot or WalMart to AMAZON.com for my supplies and great prices!I have learned that you can get more mileage from ink cartridges than the HP Low Ink Warning (black and Tri-color) tells you. What can be said is this is genuine HP ink and you should have no issue with your printer recognizing it as such. The ink is very vivid and prints great. The ink goes faster than you would think it would go!Overall, the quality of the ink is rather good despite my one complaint that the ink goes faster than I would like it to go. It's ink...it works. Have tried some off-brand ink cartridges and regretted it. Go with the HP ink. This is a genuine HP ink cartridge...although it seems to run out rather quickly. I just use the colored ink cartridge without black as it saves me some money. ink cartridges.
