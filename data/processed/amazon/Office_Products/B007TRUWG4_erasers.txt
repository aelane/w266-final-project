The erasers are mounted in such a way that they fit into the pencil either way so you have more eraser than usual. However, where are the refillable erasers? Maybe Paper Mate will sell refillable erasers if this product is a success. The erasers are effective, the pencils are comfortable, and the lead writes clearly. When both are low, you can also replace them with new erasers. Other than the erasers, there's nothing special about the pencils. PLUS the two extra double erasers they include in the package. The extra erasers and spare leads is a nice touch. Those erasers are the ingenious thing! The erasers are white. The erasers are double ended, so when one end is used up you can flip it about and use the other side. The erasers are perfect. Two extra erasers were included in the packaging. The erasers on the other hand are insanely useless. Extra erasers are nothing new in a mechanical pencil - but how easy it is to flip the eraser around to use the second one, is new (at least to me!). I also like that it comes with extra double erasers. The erasers tend to smudge. The erasers are clean and they are easily flipped using a secure click to put them in place so you never run out of eraser when you need it most. The erasers though are much like others and frankly they simply do not erase as well as the old fashioned pink erasers I had as a kid.The biggest challenge is changing the lead and the erasers. The erasers... wow, these are damn good erasers! They're not hard to flip either, so you probably won't be chasing flying erasers all over the room.The pencil has a nice, soft grip, and while I prefer a slightly larger barrel on my pens and pencils, it's not one of those wicked slimline pencils that make your hands ache after a while.

The large individual erasers on sale with school supplies should be as good.

There are no spare erasers but I rather have the 4 extra pencils.

The erasers work far better than most of today's anachronistic wooden pencils and I especially like the .7MM lead.
