There's even a glow-in-the-dark label that's fantastic for labeling the electronics behind your TV set so it's easy to find the DVD HDMI the next time you have to swap out players.I've been using it heavily for at least 8 months & I'm still using the original batteries. *This little label maker is amazing for several reasons. I haven't owned a label printer for a very long time though I certainly have the need for one. I have used this label printer for projects basic to extreme. The label cartridges are very easy to install & remove, and are also very compact. In short, it is an extremely versatile, compact label printer.The Epson uses six AA batteries (an AC adapter is available), and it takes less juice than I thought it would. After trying out the Dymo 260P label maker for Amazon Vine last spring, I decided to give this fancier Epson model a shot for compare and contrast. I have I have a Brother PC-Connectable Label Maker with Auto Cutter (PT-2430PC) and used it quite often before ordering this label maker, but it has to be connected to a computer for it to work. I love this label printer!I opened the box, put in batteries (6 batteries are needed! This is a well designed label maker with a great, compact design and many features. The good is that the label seems to conform to textured surfaces a little better than the Brother labels. Before this I've been using the Brother PT-1280 and PT-2700 label printers. The label cartridge took just a few seconds to snap in. I also have a Brother label printer and, although it doesn't offer the variety of fonts and special characters that these Epson printers offer, the Brother labels are crisper and cleaner.These printers would easily garner 5 stars if their print quality was better. I am used to using label makers by Brother. When I want to make a label, I want to do it quickly, stylishly, and without having to relearn a machine or a whole lot of fuss. The new Epson Label Works LW-400 label maker represents true innovation in the realm of home and office label makers. Once the initial label is printed from a print cartridge, printed text is centered in the middle of the label with approximately 3/8" of blank label at the front and back of the printed label. Many of the older Brother P-Touch label makers left an excessive amount of tape on the tail end of the label which required manual trimming and wasted precious tape. Overall, the Epson Label Works LW-400 label maker is a compact feature-packed label maker, which has performed very well after extensive testing. Despite never using a label maker before, I found this one to be easy to use and understand. I've owned four label makers in the last few years, and while all but the "turn-the-dial-to-pick-the-letter-then-squeeze" model were good, this is the first one that I actually love.Using the machine is easy (and similar to most other electronic label makers) because the keyboard functions much like any computer keyboard, as far as caps (hold Shift), symbols (hold Alt), etc. As a long-time GTD-er, and Brother P-Touch label user, I was delighted to have the opportunity to give the new Epson Labelworks LW-400 a spin (and perhaps permanent desk space).My Brother P-Touch is circa 2004, and a lot has changed with Epson's new labeler - backlit display, easy to read directions on the back of the machine, multiple type-faces, bigger memory, easier memory use. Love the Iron on Labels & Glow in the Dark!I have a smaller label maker from a few years ago and this one is soooo much better.To get started you either put the batteries in or find/buy a DC adapter to plug it in the wall. Once your label is printed, it cuts cleanly with a press of the large scissors icon on the side.Overall this is a well-made, easy to use label maker that allows for a great deal of customization. Since I bought my first Brother label maker many years ago, I have been a big fan of label makers. I also used a label maker to label the drawers on my toolbox. You may use a label maker to label light switches and other miscellaneous controls and devices. I have even used a label maker to label boxes. Yes, I still have a Brother label maker and I still use it. Be advised that the label maker only comes with one sample tape, 12 mm black on white. On the Brother label makers, choosing the font is as easy as pushing a couple of buttons on the front panel and selecting until you have the size you want. Therefore, if you want a small label near the top of a label, select two lines, hit enter, then select that you want a small font as the first line and hit enter again. When you enter the label, hit enter to create the second line and print. The fancier Brother label makers let you do all three, and I tend to use the centering feature with multiple lines. This Epson LabelWorks LW-400 label printer is similar in size and capabilities to the excellectBrother P-Touch PT-18R Rechargeable Labeling Systemlabel printer we've used for the past year, except for two differences I've noticed thus far:1. Not so with the LabelWorks.At first I was hesitant about an Epson mostly due to the label variety. I purchased the Epson the Brother label makers at the same time and prefer the Epson.First, the Brother's default settings combined with the way it prints and has you cut labels is designed to waste a lot of label / tape. We printed on several of the label tapes with ease. I've had several label makers before and this one by far is the easiest and most fun to use I have a label maker that is about 15 years old and it has always served me well. I thought a label maker is pretty basic...what could have changed much.The first thing I noticed about the LW-400 is that it is much more user friendly than my old model. I've had a label maker for years, but it was bulky, difficult to use, and offered only one width of tape that was often difficult to find (not to mention expensive) in my local office supply. Rather than being included with the label maker, you must buy it separately from the Epson website.2. This label maker packs a lot of features into its handy 4.33" W x 6.7"L x 2.2"D size. When I received this label maker from Epson, I was once again skeptical that it would have what I needed and wanted. The label maker can store several labels in memory, which is quite a handy feature when making multiples of repeat labels. Like when I would use a Brother label maker, sometimes I would get an inch of blank label before the text started, much less on this product. So you do not waste the label making material. Since this label maker is very portable and works with batteries, you can carry it around and make labels for your boat, your storage areas, and other places where using a computer could be inconvenient.There are lots of options. After using somewhat similar label maker (Brother P-Touch) for several years and finding it OK, but limiting for many things I gave the EPSON a try. This is my favorite label maker ever.I love the huge number of fonts (14) and the many many styles, borders, symbols, and layouts. Just type out a label, slap it on, iron it down and you are done! LOVE this label maker! What I like about this label maker:--Many options for typeface and type size--Relatively easy to figure out what the various buttons do--Works fast--Doesn't waste expensive label tape--Easy to make multiple copies of the same labelWhat I don't like about it:--The type quality could be better--I still haven't figured out how to store a frequently used label, although that's one of its most appealing featuresStill, overall a good product. I can't rave enough about this label printer. I got out this label maker.All along, I'd assumed that it would be complicated to use, which is why I didn't really ever try to use it. **the label backing is super easy to remove. So I re-did the label to get it the way I like it.My advice: by all means, get this labeler. The LW-400 label printer has numerous font and character size choices and 89 choices of borders available. Some label makers create labels that are nearly impossible to separate from their backing. It might be a great label maker but the learning curve is ridiculous for something that should be intuitive and simple. This is a great label maker for your intermediate and some advanced label making needs. I can make a label that glows in the dark. The Epson LabelWorks LW-400 Label Printer is easy to use and provides numerous label making functions. I had my first label printed within 10 minutes of opening the box. When creating a label you have the ability to:-Add punctuation, symbols and characters with an accent mark-Change the font, font size, and font style to include italic, bold, outline, shadow and different combinations thereof-Choose from 89 frames/borders to add to the label-Save formatting for up to 50 labels-Specify the length of the label-Adjust the space between characters-Create vertical text-Create mirror image text-Create a barcode label-Create labels to identify cables-The LCD screen is bright and easy to read-The buttons are easy to useThe Epson LabelWorks LW-400 Label Printer is a great tool to organize any projects or items that you may have. There are so many label options that you can easily find a style to fit whatever need you have from labeling a toolbox, first aid kit, files, cables, name tags, caution tags, etc. this is a real nice label maker & uses label's of all sizes & colors. The Epson LabelWorks LW-400 label printer is sturdy label printer. Like all label makers, the labels can be difficult to peel the backing off of.It does have memory and other features to store commonly made labels.I
