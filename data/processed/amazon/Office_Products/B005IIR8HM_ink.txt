I really like how easy the ink cartridges are to install. The black ink seems to be used up much more quickly. There are four ink cartridges for this printer - black, cyan, yellow, and magenta. The included ink cartridges last for about 1,000 black pages and 900 color pages. The ink also does not dry out and clog the output nozzles which led to having to constantly clean and replace the ink cartridges with the HP printers.Set up with this new model was a breeze though the whole priming cycle seemed to go on with lots of clicks and clacks for a long time! The ink cartridges are huge (feels like 70% the size of a VHS tape), but the starter cartridges are not completely filled with ink. The ink that comes with the printer can print about 1000 pages (900 with color). I feel like I change out my ink SO often that my inkjet printer was a waste of money. Four ink cartridges about the size of old 8 mm cassette tapes are easily inserted. The four ink cartridges come in vacuum packed seals, and you're recommended not to open them until you're putting them in the printer. Yes, I realize the ink for this printer is more "ink" than "toner", but I've been saying toner for the stuff you put in a printer that lets it print so long I have a hard time forcing myself to say something other than the word "toner". :)UPDATE: I saw where the four ink cartridges are available from Amazon.com as well. Specialized ink dries very quickly (it claims on contact) so I haven't experienced smudging or anything unpleasant. The ink is proprietary and expensive. Rather than buy more new ink, I went ahead and bought the new printer a bit earlier than I had planned. The Epson WP-4530 begins an ink priming process which can last for up to 12 minutes. Also, I got a little confused by the ink installation instructions. It's easy to use, doesn't jam much and you can use "knock-off" ink to save lots of money. The (unfortunately expensive) ink cartridges are able to print up to 1000 black/white pages and 900 color. Loading of the ink cartridges was easy as was loading paper.SOFTWAREI am running mixture of Mac computers including one on OS X 10.7 / Lion and others on Snow Leopard. I can't comment on the ink, since we've not had to replace the small original cartridges it came with. Replacing ink could be costly though, since there are four cartridges (3 color and one black). Large ink cartridge. The ink is cheap, doesn't run (not even when fresh right out of the printer) the prints look great.As an all in one for a home or home office, this is a great machine that is easy to setup and use. BIG ink cartridges...they are HUGE!! With ink cartridges about the size of a deck of cards, I've only recently gotten the message that I'm getting low on black. However, recently it's started leaking black ink all over every page I print and it's getting worse and worse. Be sure to shake the ink tanks before installing them.
