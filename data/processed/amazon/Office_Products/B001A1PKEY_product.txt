I recommend this product for someone that wants to fit loose notebook papers or receipts in the folders and doesn't need a whole lot of space to put paper in each folder. This is a terrific product from Wilson Jones. Great outer product so it should withstand being packed and transported to and from locations. All in all, an excellent product which will come in handy in many ways. Overall a great product! A good and useful product. I really like this product, but wish the black string and closure was a bit more durable. This product is simply too pricey. This is a great product with an interesting edge. I have never seen another product that does the same thing. With this product, I can take as few or many folders with me as I want. I received this product for free to review from the Amazon Vine program. It's not quite a five-star product for me, because the top part is stiff and hard to hold out of the way while you dig out what you need. When I saw this product, I knew she'd love it. I hope they revisit and improve this product, I would gladly invest in a few of these if some improvements were made.
