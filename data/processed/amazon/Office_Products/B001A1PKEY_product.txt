All in all, an excellent product which will come in handy in many ways. Overall a great product! A good and useful product. I really like this product, but wish the black string and closure was a bit more durable. This product is simply too pricey. This is a great product with an interesting edge. I have never seen another product that does the same thing. With this product, I can take as few or many folders with me as I want. I received this product for free to review from the Amazon Vine program. It's not quite a five-star product for me, because the top part is stiff and hard to hold out of the way while you dig out what you need. When I saw this product, I knew she'd love it. I hope they revisit and improve this product, I would gladly invest in a few of these if some improvements were made.

I recommend this product for someone that wants to fit loose notebook papers or receipts in the folders and doesn't need a whole lot of space to put paper in each folder.

This is a terrific product from Wilson Jones.

Great outer product so it should withstand being packed and transported to and from locations.
