This is a very nice mouse pad - quite comfortable, and it fits very nicely in front of my one speaker. This 3M mouse pad with wrist rest built in is cute on the desktop and a good size. I prefer my old mouse pad that has a smoother surface. Other than that, the mouse works well on the surface and it grips well to my desk top. When I saw this mouse pad, it had her name written all over it. )Overall, it's a well made mouse pad and my daughter loves it. This is a great mouse pad with a very comfortable gel wrist rest. I love that the mouse pad bottom is tacky enough to stay put on my desk and the design is pretty cute and girly (which works since I'm a girl). I use an optical mouse and have had no problems with the actual mouse pad surface. I was happy to have been offered this mouse pad and have been pleased with the product thus far. Now I've never had a mouse pad with a wrist support before so cannot compare with any others but the gel wrist support of this particular mouse pad has been very helpful, especially since I've been having nerve problems in my wrist, fingers, and arm lately, and it has made going online less painful. I use an optical mouse and the space of the pad has not been a problem at all; I only need to move the mouse slightly, but I don't know how well a ball mouse would do on it. I use an optical mouse which pretty much works on any surface, however I find my mouse works especially well on this little mouse pad. If you've never used a mouse pad with a wrist rest, you are in for a treat! This mouse pad has a very adequate space for the mouse, too, unlike some others with the wrist rest that do not. This is a must for mouse computer users. If you need a SMALL mouse pad, then this is probably a good solution for you. However, as a mouse pad, it is quite effective and stays where you put it.Can't miss the fact that it has a very girly design. I usually use a mouse pad with a wrist rest (say that three times fast) and it really keeps my hand and wrist comfortable all day. 3M(TM) Mouse Pad, Clear Gel Wrist Rest, Daisy DesignIf you've never had a 3M mouse pad you owe yourself a favor getting one. What I like about this mouse pad:- it has a non-slip back- it's pretty; especially for a young girl- the mouse moves easily over the surfaceThe mouse pad area is about 25% too small but I suspect that is because this seems to be a child's mousepad.What I really don't like and the reason I rated this 2 stars is because the gel pad is too hard and actually hurts my wrist. It's a perfect little mouse pad to brighten your desk. The mouse glides smoothly on it, and the gel support is really awesome. Well overall its great...Nice mouse pad..Cute..I love pink so had to buy it...The mouse glides on it wonderfully and the gel wrist rest is great support for my risk..couldn't ask for nothing better The mouse pad is great and the gel wrist rest provides great support for people who work on computers for long periods of time. The mouse glides cleaning across the pad with no hickups.For my first foray into 'wrist' rest mousepads, I have to say that the 3M Clear Gel Wrist Rest pad totally worked for me.I would recommend this product to ease sore wrists or to just use to keep your wrists from getting sore.Natalie S. for Amazon Vine ;-)This mouse pad is quite small, so it will work well for an optical mouse, but NOT the old-school ones with a trackball. The mouse pad doesn't take up a lot of room, it's sturdy in that the corners won't flip up after prolonged use and it's teeny-boppy with its bright daisy design. I don't usually use a mouse pad but the mention of gel just interested me. The mouse also glids along it very well with no sticking problems at allThe wrist mat is made of gel and is suppose to keep your wrist in a neutral position for comfort. I would say if you are just surfing the net and not having to move the mouse up and down a page to draw a line, or color a space full length than this is a great product. This 3M mouse pad rocks!!! The mouse pad area is large enough to allow comfortable movement of the mouse (some mouse pads seem short and tight). I love this mouse pad! It's a heavy mouse pad. I am happy that I chose the mouse pad! With the Daisy Design, this mouse pad is very cheery and fun. I kept bumping the mouse into the gel wrist rest and couldn't scroll as far as I needed.O
