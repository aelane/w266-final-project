I would probably stick with traditionally sized file folders. Sometimes I remember what color the file is and with all of the files and junk in my drawer it isn't easy to find. A single file can get overstuffed very quickly. Well what is there to say aobut the hanging file folders, they are 3 different colors and hand on the file hangers nicely. These are pretty standard file folders excepting the cardboard strips you can use to stabilize the bottoms for expansion. These are great hanging file folders for thick contents because of the sturdy construction and reinforcement strip at the bottom of the folder. They do keep the file drawer neat. My file cabinets are a mess and they're very full (I sometimes wish I could just toss everything in a dumpster and bit it farewell). I also found them to be quite handy for grouping numerous file folders together. * One should verify that the file cabinet you use does match the sizing and styles of the folders, as some new cabinets and desks are smaller and  may not  use hanging folders3. At first I thought these were your normal file folders, a little wider than usual, but not much to set them apart.Well, my mistake. These hanging file folders will recall those heady, hormone-filled times of your youth, when no one had AIDS except Commies, and when a man's right to free speech was as natural and obvious as his right to carry a gun. I keep one file drawer with hanging folders and documents that probably should be scanned and shredded. I have always used Smead for all of my hanging file needs over the years. Many file cabinets don't use hanging folders so check and make certain that you really need them. So trying to flatten the file to make it smaller makes it too tall to fit into a standard height filing cabinet. I'm a file freak, I'll admit it.
