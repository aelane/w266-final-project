Well, this is a bulletin board. This board is very lightweight and a great size, it's not too big so it can fit in a lot of tight places, yet it's not too small that you can't stick a lot of stuff on it. Who knows what might grow behind this board if that's your choice (in my house the spiders will take up residence). I actually found a board on Amazon that is less than $10, and hangs like a picture and I intend to buy it since it has several great (bonafide) reviews. I wanted to use this board in my office, not on my fridge. This bulletin board didn't come with a single tack. Plus foam board can be bought in oversized pieces that can be cut down or in various other sizes and can even be &#34;doubled&#34; if you want to attach heavy items.Simply NOT a good value. This is perfect for board for me since I have trouble remembering appointment etc. The board itself is a nice size in that it fits behind our pantry door and does its job. The only that would really sway me to purchase this board over another would have to be price. I could see the Quartet Cork Bulletin board being used in a dorm room by a college student, or for travel by someone who has to give presentations on the go. I wanted a bulletin board but at the store they are VERY expensive and either too big or too small. My board is stuck to my metal filing cabinet with magnets, so I haven't experienced any wrecked paint. The board is light enough that the magnets hold it up just fine.I don't love it, but the board does what I need it to do at work. This one is definitely not a superior board; in fact, flimsy is the word that best describes it. The entire board weighs next to nothing, which makes it simple to hang. I tried my very best to hang the board squarely on the line I had drawn, yet I was a little off and the board hangs slightly crooked. There is NO WAY to adjust or remove the board now. Actually, I am expecting that if I ever do want to remove the board, the wall paint is going to come along with it. But, I was anxious to get the board hung, so I acted impulsively. The board does the job. Removing the board may take part of your wall depending on the surface that you stick it to. Now that they're tacked to this board, it's harder to miss them.Like other inexpensive Quartet products, the frame is plastic, not metal ("silver frame" notwithstanding). (Quartet's oak-finish board is larger -- and costs less. This is okay, only if you never move the board.

What I like most about this board is that it is EXTREMELY Lightweight  and includes  4 permanent Self-Stick Pads that attache it to the wall.I opened the package and within 5 minutes the Board was on my wall and in use.

I have the Silver Frame and will put this board in my Garage.

I gave this board to my teenage daughters and they use for pictures and post notes reminders.
