The Accent Highlighters tend to smear ink and pencil on the paper; the Gel markers do not.WINNER:  TIEDURABILITY:  I've accidentally left Accent highlighters uncapped overnight and they died. They don't.These are not typical ink markers, the gel is like a clear gel deodorant. Because they are a solid and do not a wet ink, they won't dry out if you forget to re-cap them (great for kids!) and they won't smear your ink if you are highlighting notes you wrote using a pen.These highlighters work great on Bibles, they don't bleed through pages and unlike crayon or colored pencils, they are bright and vivid and stand out on the page.They also work on all different kinds of paper surfaces, making it fun for kids doing art projects. )When they say they are smudge-free, they mean they will not smudge the ink you highlight the way a regular highlighter sometimes does, but the highlight itself does smudge, the pink more so than the other colors. The ink comes out unevenly and very light, almost like a crayon. Also, the ink (if you can call it that) comes out looking more crayon-y than ink-like. I had to struggle to make the ink smear even slightly on paper, although the gel wipes off glass easily. Won't smear the ink? The ink then smears, the paper becomes this insidious color and the highlighter is then left with ink on it. They also don't smear or smear ink.
