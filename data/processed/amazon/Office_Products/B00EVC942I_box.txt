A box which says you are giving or getting something really special. First, it comes in a good looking black box with magnetic closing--making a nice appearance if giving it as a gift, maybe along with a journal or stationery. It arrives in a basic but decent box making it an ideal gift for friends or co-workers. The box itself is not as &#34;gifty&#34; looking or feeling as it could be and could seem to cheapen the gift of one of these pens in the eyes of the recipient. Unfortunately, the box was crushed on one side during transit so I tossed it.4 STARS: I love the way the pen writes. A heavy black box in a slide-out cover, closed magnetically, opens to find the pen held down to a satin pillow by a matched satin ribbon. I was even more surprised when I opened the very nicely made box that presents this budget-priced pen so well! It comes in an attractive box. The box is nice--would be good for a gift. It comes in its own very nice box for storage. When you open this box, the Pilot logo is repeated on the inside top and the pen rests on a "satin-look" pillow, held in place by a matching ribbon. The box the pen comes in was nice as well -- incase you're gift giving.
