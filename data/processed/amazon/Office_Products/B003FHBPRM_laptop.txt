When taking my laptop in and out of my carrying bag, I have found that the pop-up dispenser comes loose easily, and/or the post-its themselves bend or tear. I've stuck one to my laptop, and one on the side of my printer near my desk-top computer. Not very practical.They just aren't needed for a laptop; I, like most computer users, make all my notes on a desktop version of post-it notesPost-it Software Noteswhen I'm on my laptop, not on pieces of paper.I really can't even see the point of it for a laptop-based office receptionist working for a group of salesmen; she'll run out of notes on a daily basis & they have to be applied to the BACK of the laptop, which isn't very ergonomic.I've racked my brain & the only practical use I can find for these is as a refrigerator-mounted message center for the family on the go. These are very convenient especially if you take your laptop from place to place. Since I do not move my laptop around a lot, I don't think I will be replacing these. will you stick it on the laptop? Anyway, I wouldn't dare uglify my laptop by sticking one of these cheap looking paper dispensers on the back. I stuck them on my laptop as suggested and have used them several times when I need an order number or ticket number when dealing with a service provider. Because if you are going to stick these to your laptop, you still need a pen or pencil. And you are probably carrying your laptop in a sleeve, bag or backpack, so if you have room for a pen/pencil, you probably have room for a piece of paper. I put one on my laptop and so far I don't notice any problem with heat build-up effecting them.This is the sort of item I might buy if I needed something small to purchase so that my order would get free shipping. I stuck these on my laptop and first thing I know they would get hung up on my case when I was storing it. These can be attached to a laptop, monitor, desk, or anything that you need to have them be accessible and convenient. Even when your laptop is open the dispenser doesn't fall off. Wouldn't it be great if your laptop had a simple, unobtrusive, yet elegant container unassumingly strapped with non-damaging adhesives on the back of your computer's screen? I don't have a laptop. They do adhere well to my laptop. I have my laptop with me all the time. Just a bit awkward while moving your laptop. Until you put your laptop in your bag (or if you manage to do that, when you take it out)... then it's a disaster.The pad holder just gets caught on everything, whether you've got a slide-in style or a top fold; it gets caught. I have not put any on my laptop because after use I store my laptop in a case, and I didn't want the case pulling the dispenser off the laptop. Stick it to your laptop and you've always got a post-it handy. I put one on my laptop. I have not used it for my laptop or any other form of mobile note taking, but I can say that if you want to have Post-It Notes handy near the fridge, phone, TV, etc... then this might be a good idea for you. I stuck it on my laptop and removed it after a few days, just to test it out and it doesn't seem to have left any residue.The pros of this item are its slim profile, the ability to remove the dispenser and refill it, and its convenience. Plus, it doesn't have to be used exclusively on a laptop, it can also be used anywhere you might need a convenient memo pad, such as a refrigerator, locker, etc. Unfortunately, the Laptop Notes Dispenser never made it to my laptop. !I don't really need it for my laptop, since it spends 95% of its time on my desk in a docking station...but I can see that this product would work quite well there too. Putting the laptop in a case knocks this off or opens it... So handy when using my laptop, right size, handy little dispenser.
