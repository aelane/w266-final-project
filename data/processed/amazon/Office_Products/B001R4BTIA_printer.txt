Setting up the printer and the profiles on my 13" MBP was a breeze and getting great prints from Lightroom has been quick and easy.We have been much happier with the quality and convenience of having our own printer. I haven't really tested this printer on any 13"x19" shots yet but will soon. This printer was amazing for my event photography business. I have used this printer for a couple years and never had a single problem. When I got this printer the price was much higher than it is now. Bought this printer on Ebay. It is a big printer physically. This printer is the other half of a quality digital camera for someone who wants large and small quality prints. So pleased with this printer. Buy this printer new without a barcode or just new like I did and you will fall in love with this thing. CORRECT PAPER SELECTION IS CRUCIAL especially on this printer so if you are not using canon paper try and figure out how to set up your exact paper. After printing off his printer I had to say good bye to snapfish, Walgreen and shutter fly. It truly is an awesome printer.

The printer seems to be pretty good on ink.

So I purchased the printer and have sent in the rebate materials.Finally this weekend I had some time to set it up.

The printer even comes with Adobe Photoshop Elements 8 included in case you don't have image editing software - that's worth more than the total cost I laid out for this package!Now I can make 13" x 19" borderless prints - plenty large for my purposes.
