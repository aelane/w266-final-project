The labels cut VERY cleanly, even perfectly, from the dispenser, even better than Scotch tape - so the labels look very crisp and nice.The label sticks to pretty much everything well: laminate, metal, plastic, even clothes - evenly, WITHOUT frayed edges.It comes off very cleanly without residue. The labels (any length you want!) The labels left no residue and did not damage the surfaces. Lately I've been smitten by the Post-it removable labels. Marking labels are easy and you can lift and replace a few times before the sticky is gone. I have tried the pre-cut labels for folders but I do prefer the flexibility of cutting these labels to any desired length. These are just as advertised -- labels that you can cut easily (like a roll of tape) to whatever length you need. The labels are very sticky and stay on, but when it's time to remove them, doing so is very easy, without any kind of residue. I also like that unlike most labels where they are on a sheet, this label roll is more like a roll of scotch tape.The labels are 1" X 700", so it's a large enough roll to make alot of labels, to be superorganized. It works great - the labels stick well, yet are removable. The labels stayed on great, and yet were easy to peel off with no sticky residue when I was done. You can remove the labels without damaging them or the items, and you can reapply the labels within reason. I've tried moving labels among items, removing and repositioning them several times, and applying them to items in a manner I'd consider consistent with its intended use and it's performed up to expectations.It's made in the USA and comes with a satisfaction guarantee.UPDATE: After using it for a year, I still find it very handy and use it more often than I would have expected.

*****These labels made by Post-It are really nice in that not only are they removable, but you can cut them to any size.

I have found these labels to be remarkably useful.

Nonetheless, I would not consider these to be exceptionally permanent labels -- but that's not their intent.Great product and easily recommended.
