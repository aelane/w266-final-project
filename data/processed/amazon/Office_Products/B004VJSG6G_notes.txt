I tend to lose the notes without the sticky portion. Long enough for some signficant notes, and bright enough to be noticed. I use sticky notes for almost everything, including grocery lists and other things where the sticky part isn't needed. There really isn't too much to say about these sticky notes. I usually fold such notes in half and don't keep them in my pocket long enough to "bleed," so not an issue for me. Frequently, we use them to write short notes to each other - like, went to run to the store, be back at 5- and various lists for errands and house chores.These little note pads do the trick, and the fact that they are lined keeps things neat. I love sticky notes. I find the the usual sticky notes just aren't big enough to leave an adequate message including what I would like to say.The format of these notes--being both perforated as well as gummed--is unique, and normally I would not find this to be something that I "needed". I am still getting used to the sticky/perforated notes and I think they are worth a try. I'm really liking these perforated, lined sticky notes by Avery!There are 3 individual pads with 45 notes per pad.They are lined (they have ruled lines on them so you can write straight! Sticky notes that can then be torn off and taken with you for to-do lists, shopping lists, and whatever else. These Avery perforated notes are a nice alternative to standard sticky pads because you can tear away the sheet quite easily for stuffing in a pocket or purse, or handing off a note without the sticky mess. The perforated sticky notes are great...  Kool colors and they are great for home and work. These sticky notes are basically larger sized Post It's. The notes have a dual purpose as well. I love sticky notes. Sticky notes are great when we only want to stick them on something. These new sticky notes from Avery allow you to tear off the adhesive section of the sticky note, turning it into just a regular piece of note paper. I confess to sometimes wishing that my sticky notes had a perforated section to pull off so I could use the paper without the sticky.

These sticky notes stay in place and offer plenty of writing room at 4x6 inches.

Spacious for long notes - yes.

These notes function as your standard post-it, unless you need the note without the sticky top and then you can use the perforate feature to detach it.
