I have been using Avery labels for the past few years. If you want address labels, though, order some Avery labels. It's easy to use, and the labels look good. I understand that since this is not for printing labels in massive quantities, battery life isn't as important, but 6 is a lot and adds unnecessary weight to what should be a handheld device. This accepts DYMO D1 labels in 1/4", 3/8" and 1/2" width. and labels look good. I must admit that the old "punched" labels were neat, though. Make labels for your personal property. Make labels for your books, music cds, movie dvds, tools, flash drives...Here's a plus... If you want to make really fancy labels in a wider range of colors, I'd probably look to the Epson unit. The labels print very clearly even on the largest font size. We like to think that we are organized, but often scribble labels out on post it notes...which don't last. The printed labels are very durable and have a good quality adhesive. If you are planning on making TONS of labels, you might want to look into another cost-efficient device. The labels are OK, but the size is limited to 1/2 inch. It allows you to make labels from 8 - 24 pt. The labels will have the right size but just not on the screen. Yes, it prints labels. Who knew that putting labels on plastic boxes could be enjoyable?The machine gives multiple options for font size, special characters and so forth. It is super easy to use and spits out great looking labels in seconds.Very handy tool for around the house and garage.Only drawback, as mentioned by other reviewers is it takes so many batteries; it takes six AAA batterieswhich for such a small device seems excessive.The ease of use and the quality of the labels though trumps the battery issue.Happy with this label maker. The labels are neat, and I don't seem to have as much wasted tape with the DYMO as I do with the more expensive product. It isn't that it is incomprehensible, but to to just basic labels one has to go through too many menus and clicks and selections. Sure it is easy to use for making lettered labels, but it is rather bothersome to do -- let's say clip art -- in a streamlined way, if you have to do a lot of labels like that. The labels are easy to apply. I stuck a few labels in different text sizes to the back of the unit.-can't mix modifiers: whole label is underline or whole label isn't underline. But if I'm printing say 10 labels, it wastes tape by snipping off the leader tape before _each_ of the 10 labels. If you need 3/4" or larger labels, you're going to need to get the500TS(takes labels up to 1"),450D(takes labels up to 1"),420P(takes labels up to 3/4"), and360D(takes labels up to 3/4").- Limited Label SelectionDYMO has a more limited selection of colored labels than Brother. (If you can't find the colored labels you're looking for, here's an idea: try using colored dots, like these Avery 1/4" Diameter Colored dots to color-code your DYMO labels! The labels themselves are the same, which is good -- you can use your existing tapes, if they're compatible with the Dymos.The only thing I liked better about another model is that it came in a magnetic holder (this one doesn't) -- but that's just being nitpicky. The labels look good and adhere well. And for the labels themselves- nothing can even come close to the sturdy, practically indestructible, beautifully printed Dymo labels.This DYMO 160 hand held model label maker sits in my hand nicely, but I prefer sitting it down, as it is not that light weight. I should know about these labels being almost totally indestructible, as I have DYMO labels still on my craft containers from 1972! They are truly the best labels ever, and they come in many different colors as well, so you can color code when you organize. I've used White labels with black, red or blue type, also red, yellow or blue labels with black type and clear labels with black, red, blue or white type. The most stunning labels I've used are the black labels with white type- they really stand out. We are able to create labels for our office, and that is fantastic. The labels it prints on the 1/2" tape I received are clear and don't seem to smudge.

), the labels don't stick well.

It will produce reasonably clear labels (especially if you go above 12pt font).

My labels are simply that - labels of names of things.
