The bright colors make them useful for a number of functional and fun purposes, including highlighting and detailed note taking. The first 7 colors are awesome! There are 7 bright colors plus black that retract smoothly and write flawlessly. While I cannot use them they seem to be very happy with the vibrant colors. All the colors wrote nice and dark except for the hot pink which was a bit too neon and could have been darker. They write smoothly and the colors are nice. The colors are black, blue, red, pink, light blue, green, purple, and orange. The only two colors I had trouble getting started were pink and green. The colors are a little brighter than you might think just looking at the barrel.Crafters and kids will love this set particularly because of the color variety. The colors give note-taking and meetings a little 'pick-up.' However the colors seem less vibrant than they should be. I found them to write very smoothly and the colors are bright and fun. First of all, I love the colors but then, I'm a girl (ok, woman LOL) and I'm a big fan of pretty colors. Clear bright colors and writes very smoothly. Even the light colors are quite legible.When you use a pen for the first time, you have to remove (scrape off) a little plastic blob on the end which must be there to keep the ink fresh. The colors are clear and attractive together. The colors are bold and easy to read; the flow of the ink is smooth and effortless. The colors are crisp and bright and the pens write smoothly and clearly, every single time. Although some of the colors are a bit bright (but perfect for those you are young and young at heart), these pens are effortless to write with. Cool colors, fun to use but not for long. Can't wait to see what other colors they come in. The colors are pretty basic as far as selection, and they only write well when holding the point of the pen facing down, so if you try to hold a piece of paper against the wall to write something quickly, they won't work. Love the colors! And that is too bad because the colors are impressive. They could use the colors to accent the event they are showing. The colors are pretty and bright. The colors are vivid, and the ink doesn't "clump" like with ball points. You get 8 different colors in 1 pack and they have retractable points, so you can't lose the caps and, one supposes, they shouldn't dry out as quickly as normal gel pens. All other colors wrote smoothly coming out of the package.-Green, Light Blue and Pink left a "dot" when you finished your stroke. Various colors so they would be good for sketching different colors, don't know if you want to sign checks with pink or orange. There are more colors than I would ever use, but others may want this many choices.
