This is a great first binder for an elementary student. This binder is a great way for students to organize all there papers, pencils, pens and other things for school. This binder keeps everything in its place and everything neat so various things are easy to find when you need them. Inside it has a 2-inch three-ring binder, two large pockets for holding papers, and a small Velcro pocket for phone or calculator. Great binder! This binder has a feature that can&#8217;t be beat: You can zip it closed. My old binder was easy to open, lay flat on my desk, and had tons of useful little features built on. It's pretty much a standard 2" 3-ring binder with a zipper on it. I love this binder, seriously I know it's a binder but I love it. The binder itself can be spread out flat for convenience, which is nice.The real problem comes with the 2 inch rings. If you need a binder this one is a good one to choose. This is the perfect binder for my 5th grade daughter. This binder is perfect for a middle school kid. , this is a great all-in-one binder. This binder has nice organization features. I carry a binder at work that contains materials I need to work with different student groups throughout the day. I gave this Mead 2-inch binder a test drive and this is what I discovered.Roomy:  Multiple pockets hold papers, pens/pencils, and 3x5 notecards. But the binder was easy to open and close and the rings matched up perfectly each timeFlexible binder: The binder material (under the fabric) is flexible, but can easily be bent and folded or dented. The binder is a nice color and has plenty of pockets and little places to put things. The binder has high quality, several individual pockets and is has a very nice appearance. I love this binder. When you open the binder, there are 2 grayish pockets---one on either side---large enough to hold ten or more sheets of paper each. Overall, it's a great binder and I'm going to buy one for my grandson going into 2nd grade and one for my grandson going to college this fall. You probably only need to bring this binder to class--no more lugging a book bag. The binder has a big, sturdy zipper that will keep all the inserts safe, and there's also a smaller zipper case incorporated into the cover for your pens and pencils. This is an attractive binder that has some nice features, such as a small outside zipped pocket that offers a small folder type pocket for securing small items and elastic loops for pens. This binder would be improved by the addition of a carrying handle and/or strap, but at its price point it is a nice product. This is not the binder of your dreams, it's not beautiful, one reviewer points out it doesn't have a handle. If you are just looking for a binder with a zipper to keep all your papers from falling out, then this Mead zipper binder is a worthwhile purchase. So, if you need a binder that is fairly well constructed and don't need much organization features (for example if you are taking just one class at school) then this binder (which comes in several different colors) might be useful for you. It's got the typical three ring binder and some well thought out pockets. This binder has several pockets and spaces to keep multiple items, including the ancient technology items like pencils and pens. The entire binder has a zipper closure, preventing interior items from falling out. This binder should provide adequate protection for your notes and documents, and is reasonably priced. This is a decent binder with some good storage in a couple pockets. Since my favorite binder has disconnected from its cover, this is a reasonable replacement. The binder felt floppy, like poor quality cardboard.

This binder does have an inside slit on each cover for using as a folder and a small inside pouch for your lunch money.

This binder was like the Corolla of the line, and the FIVESTAR binder is like the Avalon, if we're talking Toyotas :-)  I prefer a bit more luxury in a binder.

The main binder zipper doesn't close completely, which would be a problem if you're used to throwing your pens in the binder after the lecture, but since you've got a couple handy spots to quickly stash a pen on the outside cover, no problem.This is a nice binder, which seems likely to last a school year, and it's a pretty color, which is easy to see and grab amongst the mess of books, etc.
