The wireless works flawlessly.Finally, I tried printing a photo. No wireless scanning on this model though, which is a bit disappointing. This is described as a wireless printer so no cable was included even though it could be connected with a cable. With the wireless network feature, you can put the printer just about anywhere there is electrical power available. It's so great to have a wireless printer.Print quality is good, and it is quite fast as well. However, it does connect over your wireless network and is capable of printing from mobile devices. Since I use the Fax occasionally, and depend on wireless printing, this was going to be acceptable. The wireless set up is flawless, unlike my Canon MP series printer, which I can't even connect to wifi. Being wireless, I can't see ever going back to wired printers.Four out of five stars for being a solid light-use unit with nice quality of print. The wireless printing is an excellent feature. The wireless set up for the second was super easy, thanks to a video on Epson's website. I felt comfortable enough with wireless that I decided to skip the USB cable. The wireless worked great and now I can print from any room in my house.I was impressed. I can never get other wireless printers to work correctly. I have set up several Epson wireless printers and have never needed a USB cable. The wireless Epson, Expression Home XP-400 Small-in-One Printer prints, copies and scans.Following the easy instructions, I was printing documents within 20 minutes after I opened the box.For me, the most amazing aspect of this device is the free software that allows me to print remotely from anywhere in my home.I was looking for a printer that looks nice, was easy to setup and would provide efficient wireless printing from my lap top in my living room. This may very well be the perfect wireless color inkjet printer. If you are looking for a small inexpensive wireless capable color printer, you just found it!
