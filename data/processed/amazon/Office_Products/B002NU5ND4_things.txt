I haven't started to color-code things with them yet, but I can see that coming as another handy way to utilize them. I don't think I can live without these things!AD2 The Avery Round Edge Note Tabs are just the coolest, cutest little things! The really nice things are you don't have to have that extra divider page and if you need to move them around, you can. These are great little things to have as study helpers to use as section markers and making additional notes here and there. They work as advertised and help keep things organized. These are the best things since peanut butter !! They allow you to do two things at once: mark a spot and make annotations.I like to put the subject or main idea on the tab and then use the translucent stick-on part for notes or details. These things really work! What I've found is that I can use the NOTETABS to keep up with things I jot down and need to keep up with versus the stuff I scribble and can forget. I could see how things would smudge if you didn't let them dry, like gel pens.
