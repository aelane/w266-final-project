Reinforced tabs. The reinforced tabs hold up extremely well! These are reinforced at the top which mean the tabs wont bend and break off like standard folders after continued use. It's just that I expected a little more out of the tabs, given that there's an emphasis on them in the marketing of the product.I'm a person who doesn't believe in needlessly cutting down trees, so I re-use my file folders, sometimes for years. But just don't expect that the tabs on these are going to be particularly superior. I have found that the tabs tend to bend or become creased when placed in a briefcase and frequently removed in a not always too gentle manner. These reinforced tabs do make a difference! The tabs are reinforced and the folders are made of quality stock. The reinforced tabs make them tougher than the usual plain folders. the reinforced tabs on these folders make them extra strong. What happens all the tabs slap the cabinet like a card in a bicycle spoke.. these tabs can take a beating! The tabs are reinforced so that they won't curl or rip. The tabs are reinforced, which means they don't tear as easily. Not only are the tabs on these folders reinforced but the  folder itself seems to be a bit thicker than the cheap office store brand files I have been buying. It's true that the tabs on standard manila folders start to wear out, and eventually fall off completely, after use.These Smead reinforced tab folders are simply standard sized manila folders, with double the material in the tab area, so the tabs stay strong and more resistant to long-term use. The tabs are consistently cut. The reinforced tabs on these file folders are just enough stronger that I expect them to last longer than the ones I normally use. It's definitely the reinforced tabs. These tabs make the folders more durable because you're always grabbing them by the top edge and opening them by the tab.
