It does shred a stack of paper. If no stack is present, it's smart enough to accept manual feed. It does however allow you to place a stack of up to 80 sheets under the lid on the top and this unit very effectively handles the chore for you to auto feed the sheets one at a time.As far as the individual capacity I had placed some old spreadsheets in there which were really an 8 1/2" x 11" when folded over so it was equivalent to two sheets with a common edge binding them. You can put a stack of papers in and walk away while it works away...totally cool. I fed one stack into the Swingline shredder, and started feeding another stack, a few sheets at a time, into the Fellowes shredder. I went through a slightly bigger stack on the Fellowes, while the Swingline was still plodding through its stack.So if you need the load-and-go feature, and are ok with the shortcomings I've described, this isn't a bad product. You no longer need to be present to shred a stack of papers. It generally handles the stack without human intervention and does so quietly and efficiently. It would be much quicker to get thru a large stack. I could sometimes get through a stack often without the papers getting stuck. I liked that I could drop a stack of papers in, not worry about taking out staples, and just walk away and let it do its job. You can simply put the stack within the unit, walk away, and come back to have it all done.First, the basics. Just stack it it close the lid and go about my day.We have a home tax office and my partner loves this. It worked really well for about the first 1/4 of the stack then started stopping and needing readjustment all the time. How long does it take to shred a stack of paper?2. What's great: you can throw in a stack of paper (not a huge stack, but at least ~20 sheets), close the lid, and this thing will just start grinding away. No, it can't take a stack of 25 sheets and shred them in one pass but then you're comparing it to something like the Fellows Powershred 2339S, which costs $1700.This shredder fills a nice niche. You can feed a stack of up to 60 sheets at a time or just 5 sheets through the feeder. Put the stack of papers in the tray, and let them shred. It allows you to shred a stack of documents easily and quickly. I can place a large stack of papers in the shredder and it will shred them all. Being able to insert a stack of unfolded letter size paper and have it automatically shredded is beyond doubt the main selling point for this shredder.Unfortunately, it is usually only once or twice a month that I have this type of shredding task.

Typically I get through a stack in 5-8 minutes.

This will typically get you through a full stack, since the continuous run time is 10 minutes before auto-shutoff.

When the stack tray feeds the paper into the shredder mechanism, it pulls the paper to the middle and folds it in half first.
