My mouse (I use a Logitech) glides very easily across the surface with excellent tracking and control. This is a good mouse pad. I just have to say that I love this mouse pad! I find it to be the best mouse pad that I've had. The Zowie G-TF "Spawn" mouse pad is one of the nicest mouse pads I've used. This Zowie mouse pad is the size of a place mat that you would use at a dinner table. I would never have guessed that a mouse pad would have made such a difference in computer work! This mouse pad is very large so you will need a big space to lay it on. This is one substantial mouse pad! I never thought much about mouse pads before, always using ones that were on the small side, but this is really nice. This is a well-made mouse pad that looks great. Most mouse pads will work well if you are surfing the web. I love my huge mouse pad. I went without a mouse pad with my optical mouse, but the desk surface was not friendly with it - it would skip a lot. Unlike many other expensive mouse pads that have raw edges that start to fray and seperate the layers after a little use, Zowie has thoughtfully sewn the edges into a nice finished surface that will hold together through a lot of use. This is probably the most comfortable, durable and resistant mouse pad I've ever used. You can swipe your mouse across it with ease, with no hiccups.I don't really know what else to say. This mouse pad has a lot going for it - firstly it's HUGE, and I'm not exaggerating.

My Logitech G5 mouse glides over this pad with ease.

That mouse pad was made out of a PVC material (plastic) and was textured for easy gliding.

This is an excellent mouse pad.
