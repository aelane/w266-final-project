This "Fragile" package tape is wonderful. I wouldn't trust a really fragile package to this tape alone since it is thinner than the standard packing tape. It is thin enough to not add much weight to your package, but strong enough to work as a good sealing tape. I did however, receive one package that had a similar tape wrapped around the seam of the box.One thing I liked better about the "other" tape was that the lettering was almost 1 3/4" high and one inch wide depending on the letter. It does not feel especially sturdy so I would not use it to tape up a package by itself. You may not want to use it on every package shipped (unless they are truly fragile) -- you'll see your packaging costs go up. It is however fine for labeling a package with fragile contents. know it's a FRAGIL package. I would not use this to seal a package because of the per-roll expense of this special tape. Instead, I would recommend sealing the package in your usual way, with cheaper clear plastic packing tape, and then place a strip of this tape around the outside of the sealed package. Then, should the package be particularly fragile, wrap a single strip of this across the top to alert handlers that it is fragile.
