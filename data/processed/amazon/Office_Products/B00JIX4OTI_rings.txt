The rings are also a flexible plastic, but much thicker.There are two tabbed, one sided pocket sleeves included, with index card holders attached. I have avoided plastic rings in the past. The flex rings take a little getting used to if you haven't used them before, and it's note as quick as a traditional binder to add (or take out) paper as you need to open each ring individually.Overall, this is one of my favorite binders due to the durability and unique hybrid approach that combines a binder and notebook into one. The 3 rings are attached to the back and are reinforced with 6 rivets so that it creates a strong hold that doesn't look like it will easily break. The rings are plastic and hook into the back instead of the traditional metal center cut rings.The binder includes 60 college and 20 quad ruled (gridded) sheets or paper and has a capacity of 200 sheets. The rings are completely different than a standard binder though because they are flexible and they open individually. Although the rings aren't hard to open or close, since you have to do them each individually, it takes a bit more time.This Hybrid NoteBinder includes 5 tab dividers. I'm not sure I'd want to use it if I was constantly having to open the rings due to the fact that it takes a little more time but if you only need to open it every now and then then I think it's a great option.

The rings are also much easier to open than the stiff kind of binder.

The plastic rings must be opened and closed individually and I have difficulty with paper tearing and jamming.

The rings are perhaps a bit too flexible and avoiding those problems takes both time and patience, something most people lack.
