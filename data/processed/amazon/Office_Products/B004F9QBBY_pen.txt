Anyway, it is a nice pen, and I enjoy using it.No problems, nice pen.4 solid stars Technically this isn't a gel pen, like the retractable Bic Triumph 537RT, but you'd be hard-pressed to tell the difference. I was interested in this pen because I prefer a bold line. My current favorite pen isPaper Mate Profile Retractable Ballpoint Pens, 4 Blue Ink Pens (89472), which has a 1.4mm line. That's really all you'd want in an everyday pen, so I have to say this product delivers. I want my pen to be ready to use and ready to close without extra, detachable accessories and BIC Velocity Bold succeeds at this level.Besides the writing, comfort is next in importance and BIC has this area covered as well. The pen has a rubber grip and is wider close to the tip, where your fingers are placed. It is comfortably padded and nice looking, but was not, as advertised, "the best pen you'll ever use". I will gladly try out any new pen for ease of handling, immediacy of printing, and durability. This pen holds up under all the regular guidelines.I am a longhand writer, and appreciate a pen that starts ink flow without having to twiddle with it, like you have to do with many ballpoints. All in all, a good pen for keeping with a clipboard, or for field notes, or, as I use it, to jot down ideas and/or long-term plotlines. #1, I find that the pen will "glob" at different points when writing. #2, Even though this is a "bold" pen, the ink does not come out evenly, and there are "streaks" (light areas) in the writing. The pen does write smoothly; however, the lines are not vivid. I gave the pen a 3 because it is well constructed and does write smoothly. However, when I tried the pen, I was initially quite pleased.The BIC Velocity pen does have a beautiful feel to it. The pen has a nice design with a nice soft grip. The pen constantly felt solid, even when I tried writing with a lot of pressure.The pen is incredibly smooth to write with. However, I would not recommend using the pen for anything that needs to meet appearance standards due to the potential of the ink constantly smearing. Easy to see and read.So I would regard the BIC Velocity Bold as a wonderful pen for taking notes at a lecture or jotting a line on a Post-It. After using this pen for a few weeks, I have not had one issue with ink ending up on my hand. The pen is comfortable in my hand. I've been looking for a good pen. The pen does write neatly and has a comfortable grip. It is a pretty good pen for the price. This pen is very easy to hold, and th ink flows easily and neatly as you wrie. Over all this a tough pen and ideal for what ever you might need to put it through. I hate a pen that is too "thin" in the ball point. It's very easy to write with this pen, since the ink is strong and smooth.On the other hand, the color of the ink is still "muddier" to my eye than that of one of my Uniball pens, even though this appears to be pretty much the same thing. This pen is like a gel inked pen but doesn't smear. Overall, I really do like this pen. I'd definitely recommend this pen. Thus, it's not the best pen for signing things, or for writing letters you want to look perfect. This is a very smooth writing pen. I had him try the 2nd pen in the package. I like that this pen puts down enough ink to see what I am doing when marking parts in my home garage, yet doesn't "flood" whatever I am writing on with too much ink. It is however a wonderful pen for a man used to writing his Last Will & Testament every single time he leaves his garage to reenter his lovely wife's house. This is simply a very nice pen at a very nice price.

I couldn't disassemble the pen without breaking it, so I guess it's not refillable which is too bad, but that's rather par for the course for gel pens in this price range so I guess it's now being carried over to ballpoint pens.I like the thick line the pen provides when writing - I am SO not a fine line person, lol.

This pen may be the "smoothest pen in the universe" because the ink comes out like it is made of oil.

I do not like this pen.
