Even with adjusting the air slightly, it's difficult to fully concentrate on your work when you're focused on not falling off. I used an electric air mattress inflator to save time and spare my arms/hands from repetitive stress injury. It was easy to assemble but I did use an air compressor it would have taken a while to just use the pump that came with it. You do need an air compressor rather than a pump to get it right so make sure you have access to one.Put together this chair is just adorable. It was easy enough to put together - even pumping up the air ball didn't take as long as I'd feared. When full of air, I "corked" it with the provided plug and attached the strong metal legs that take three heavy-duty screws each. I don't know if it is loosing a little air or if the cover is stretching out a little, or what? I am going to add a little air to the chair and see if it returns to it's initial, tighter sit. The more air you put in the ball the taller the chair will be, and the less you will sink down while seated. There is sufficient air in the ball but it sinks in a lot when I sit on it.

If it feels too firm you let some air out until it gets to the right squishiness for your body weight.I rate this product 4 stars = I Like It.

But it just looses air over time.

*The air slowly leaks out even though I followed the directions to place the plug in.Overall, this is comfortable.
