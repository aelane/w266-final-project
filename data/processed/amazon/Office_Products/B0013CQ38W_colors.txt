The colors stay fairly true to what is pictured and it blends without much trouble. I like how vibrant the colors are.When I have a chance to use them on a chalkboard I will update my review. I like the vibrant colors of this chalk and I used it on art work for the props of my daughters upcoming dance recital.This chalk is nice and soft and easy to blend, similar to a chalk pastel. The colors are bright. The colors are beautiful. The colors really pop on black and they are of a good cosistency for writing. The colors are very nice and vibrant. The colors really pop when using a black board. These are great colors -- 2 of each, covering the spectrum -- and they show up very nicely on chalkboards (both black and blue boards). The colors are vibrant, they write smoothly, erase very easily and the dust is minimal. I was a little concerned that the colors would be hard to remove from the chalkboard, but they were really easy to remove with just a paper towel. The colors are vibrant and strong. The colors were vibrant against my black chalk board and yet erased easily and completely. I love the colors included. Would I be getting 8 colors in a pack of 12 or 12 packs of 8 colors. The colors are vibrant, it erases easily, and they supply a wide variety of colors. They are very smooth, the colors are deep, and they're low dust. The colors are vibrant and true. If you're wondering how they got only 8 colors for a 12 stick package, it's because they give you two sticks or red, yellow, blue, and green. The colors stand up to all kinds of backgrounds -- perfect for the chalkboard painted labels in my pantry-- but on paper it tended to sit on the surface without imparting pigment down into the material. It has beautiful colors but it has dust, because it's chalk. I love the colors of these chalk sticks. I was quite surprised by how vivid the colors are compared to the off-the-shelf cheapo chalk I normally buy for school. These colors are still distinguishable on the chalk board. It comes in eight different colors and adds impact on heavy use boards. And the colors really are fun. The colors are astoundingly brilliant and vivid on my very old chalkboard. The colors layer beautifully and blend nicely as well. The colors are vibrant and pretty. The colors blend nicely.There are 12 sticks of chalk, but only 8 colors.
