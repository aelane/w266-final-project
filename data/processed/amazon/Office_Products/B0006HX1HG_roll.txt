It peeled off the roll with ease. This is not a huge roll of tape, but very handy to have around the house. It's clear, it's sticky, it comes on a roll? The roll of packing tape comes with a dispenser for easy cutting. This is a laughably small roll of tape for a move. It doesn't get "lost" on the roll if you accidentally roll it back too far. If that happens, it is almost impossible to restart the roll, because its tendancy to "slivering and splitting".EZ-tape adheres well to paper, but is not "extra-wide household tape". I like the smaller roll since I do not do much mailing. When I tried to detach it from the roll, the tape did split, but that was easily fixed.

This compact roll design and built-in dispenser will easily fit in a drawer and the tape is so much easier to work with.

It comes off the roll with almost no effort at all.Another important difference with this tape is the tearing of the tape.

It also seems to get stuck to the roll less than the Scotch tape.
