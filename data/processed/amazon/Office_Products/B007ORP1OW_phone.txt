They main phone units are easy to hold for a long period and aren't heavy. I've been using this phone for a week now and haven't found anything I dislike. This phone seems like a great value for the price. Stores up to 100 phone book entries. On my older phone, I had to keep switching between handsets before the day was done. This is a great little phone . But this phone is easy to hear on even for my great grandmother with her hearing aids. Once it was all set up, I was able to place and receive phone calls from anywhere in the house or outside in the yard. We really like this phone. The phone doesn't slide down quite far enough for the lower slot to catch on the lower pin. My old phone lost these if the power was off for more than a few minutes.We have no issues with volume of phone calls or sound quality. On every other phone I've used, I pick up the handset, press the "speed dial" button, then the number key. On this phone, there is no speed dial button. My previous phone was Panasonic and survived plenty of falls (had it for 4 years). After placing the phone in the cradle, and placing the wires for power and the phone-line, I was ready to go. I was able to actually upload my phone book from my cell to this headset as well. By selecting either the phone button or cell button I can use either to dial or answer either phone using just this headset. Thus, you can answer this phone or two cell-phones no matter where you are in the house (it gives a 33 foot range, but in practice I have achieved 40-50 feet in many areas of my home without an issue).I love this feature. It is not the most stylish phone system I have seen, but it is nice looking and certainly not something to be embarrassed about in the slightest.Positives:1. First, the phone is nice looking and easy to hold. The phone also has a speaker on each headset (can use this as an intercom). I rarely ever answer this phone, and generally have the ringer turned off. I only needed a phone to set up the voice mail services and for occasional use. Great phone. I have only been using this phone about a week but I really like it. Once I got my phone book programmed in I really like it.
