This is hard plastic, not easy to get in and out of. The plastic notebook looked cheap, and I'm not sure how long those inserts would last if used often. The plastic binder has a 2-1/2" spine.3. It is hard plastic with creases (to delineate the cover, binding and back) and keeps springing open. The various plastic inserts that this comes with are nice for holding media like CDs, as are the ones that contain folders to hold papers. I think it should come fully supplied with plastic pages since it only has 9 slots total.Suggestion:  Remove the sticky labels from the pages before putting them into the slots. I use the smaller plastic pocket on the front to hold my USB drive.Media File: includes a space for 2 CDs and 2 pockets for memory cards. It would have been nice if the plastic was covered by durable fabric.Overall, I find the system very useful and will most likely buy a second organizer. The plastic is too soft to write on comfortably, and the arc-shaped black clip is nicely designed but wimpy. The plastic front and back covers are thick and durable.What I DON'T like:1. The plastic is full of static so everything sticks to it, and being black it all shows.6. It's made from hard plastic that's very flexible and retains it shape (even after being piled up with books and papers). The Pendaflex I Organise IMF System consists of a plastic closable binder with a variety of slip-in inserts. The plastic sleeves on the inside also are made with the same type of plastic that has torn for me in the past.
