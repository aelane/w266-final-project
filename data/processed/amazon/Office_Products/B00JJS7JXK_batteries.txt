Once I installed the batteries, I only put 3 of the screws back, and the unit was nonetheless well-secured. As many have said, it's ridiculously complicated to get the batteries in this thing and takes a small, thin screwdriver. Once the batteries are in, it works by pushing the on/off button.The magnet on the back works great with a strong hold to the roof of my sons locker. It requires 3 AAA batteries (not included). Once the batteries are inserted, the five screws must be carefully reinstalled. #1 - it's really difficult to put batteries in. (Replacing batteries at school will be a royal pain, because I know of no one that keeps a small Phillips head screwdriver in their locker during the school year. Seriously, putting batteries in this thing was a major pain. I hope that is true, because I will throw this out before I will attempt to install new batteries. So when the batteries die, you have to take it apart before you can check the battery size. It takes 4 batteries (and you KNOW your kid is going to accidentally leave the light on in their locker) and has 5 REALLY tiny screws to remove the entire back to install those batteries. Finally got it open, put the batteries in, and got most of the screws back in, and it is a dim light, better than no light, but not that bright. I do not know yet how long the batteries in this light will last, so this may or may not be a big deal.This little locker light is very good at doing what it's designed to do - light small, enclosed areas. You have to take the whole back off because the batteries aren't stacked together.The bulbs are bright enough, but the on/off button is likes you to be very firm. I would caution you when installing the batteries to make sure you have a small 'precision' type Phillips screwdriver. Hopefully, the batteries will last a long time. It uses 3 AAA batteries (not included). I doubt it will be necessary to change the batteries frequently, but when they need changing, this is a nuisance. After trying to figure out where the three AAA batteries went and finding no instructions on the packaging or on the light itself, hubby used his micro screw driver set to unscrew 5 tiny little screws on the back.

Three AAA batteries are all you need to power this little workhorse.

But where do the batteries go?

But if you look real close, you'll figure out where the batteries go.Now that the batteries are in, where did those darn mini-screws go to?A half-hour later, I've finally got it all back together, and the light is ready for use.I would have rated it lower than three stars, except when I asked a friend, she looked at it, and said, &#34;You don't have kids, do you?
