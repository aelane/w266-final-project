The Avery Flags come through with flying colors! And the colors could be a touch snazzier--given the relatively large number of men with red/blue colorblindness who exist, it always sort of surprises me that companies don't put in SOME effort to creat less-easily-confusible color schemes for this kind of product.A completely satisfactory, if unspectacular, office product. Bright colors and really good for keeping your place marked in whatever you need. Bright colors that are easy to see and enough variety of color to organize well. I love the Avery Flags with five different colors to place in a Bible, one for each book of the Bible. The flags themselves are narrow with bright colors. The colors are nice and bold. I particularly appreciate the different colors so I can color code my tabs. The colors are pleasant, the sizes just right, and overall I'd recommended giving them a try if you use these types of tabs at all. The colors are bright and pleasant, looking good when a mix of them are placed in the same book. Love the bright colors and how they're skinnier than other sticky tabs. (4) There are indeed 5 colors, nice, bright and easy to tell apart unless you are colorblind in which case I have no idea if they have enough contrast to differentiate effectively. It makes them much easier to work with if you need to use alternating colors. There are five colors (20 of each), so it's possible to create some kind of color-coded system, if that meets your needs. The five primary and secondary colors make it easy to spot and they can even be color-coded. All of the colors are basic shades, except the blue which is more neon.There is a Box Top on the back of the package.A note on the package states that the adhesive may mark some surfaces or lift inks and to test before using.The Avery product number is #22569. The colors are very bright and, aside from red and orange, are very different colors. With the different colors, it is easy to place these on different sets of files while marking our notes in them. Vibrant colors - blue, green, yellow, orange and red; 20 of each color.
