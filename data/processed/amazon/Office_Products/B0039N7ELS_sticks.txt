But Scotch's Dot Roller is so well designed and so practical I will never go back to glue sticks again. Glue sticks can also reveal spots where no or not enough glue was used. I never liked glue sticks, they were messy and didn't stick very well.This product is the answer. Glue sticks are messier but are a fraction of the cost. It is durable and sticks well but is removed with minimal residue. Glue sticks can be messy and they can dry up fast. I hate glue sticks, but occasionally used them behind a photo to save costs... inevitably just a dab would get on the photo and smear. We have glue sticks, but he likes this better (and so do I). The adhesive sticks instantly so there's no waiting for glue to dry.It's much like double stick tape but dispenses directly onto the surface and makes a strong bond. If only it was cheaper and could replace glue sticks entirely! We all know how messy those can get and how much of those glue sticks we have to clean off the table when our kids are done with their projects.
