It has a pretty cover but the front part of the binder doesn't seem to be sturdy enough for my use as it slopes down instead of staying rigid. The cover seems to be a very silky kind of paper over cardboard, and I find I prefer that over the run-of-the-mill plastic cover, which can feel a bit tacky at times. The cover is pretty and decorative. The distinctive cover is nice because it makes it easy to distinguish from other more plain binders. This is a nice cover for a middle school girl (or older). The cover feels like a heavy cardboard vs. plastic but should be durable. The cover is printed with soy ink. It is a sturdy hard cover binder with metal 3-ring component. It is mounted to the back cover, rather than the spine, with 2 rivets. Whatever they made the cover out of is simply too stiff and likes to keep its shape- and this goes in both directions (open and shut).

I haven't used mine too much yet, so the cover doesn't yet lay flat when it's open, but it's getting there.

The cover is stiff, but I'm used to flexible vinyl binders, and this one is what it is.

I managed to not tear the cover but there's a gummy spot that I'm unable to scrape off without further damage.
