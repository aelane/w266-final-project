You can accomplish most of what this unit does using any of Brother's more typical P-Touch devices. What sets this unit apart, in my mind, is the ability to use True Type fonts from your PC. It would be nice if the unit was powered by USB as well.Changing labels is a breeze because this uses the familiar Brother cartridges. Prior to receiving this unit, I guess I had envisioned the tapes as being simple rolls that would be threaded in. The unit has some very cool features that makes this versatile label printer a really useful device:* Prints a wide variety of labels from 9/64" to 1" thick* Labels are cartridge based, so changing styles is very easy* Powered by 6 AA batteries (not included) or AC Power Supply (included)* No software needs to be preloaded on PC for basic design and printing, contained in Labeler (very cool)* Included software allows for more advanced designs and supports barcodes* Supports graphics, pictures are not too good but our company logo looks great* Includes USB cable and 1/2" starter LabelsThe labeler worked great right out of the box and was easy to set up without even having to read the directions. This unit is very easy and intuitive to use and most people will find that the  Editor Lite software installed in the unit is so versatile with many included fonts, symbols and frames they would not need to install the more comprehensive Editor software on their computer.A great feature;you can capture or import images to use on the labels but that works best with black and white line art. This also makes the unit more portable by letting you use whatever Windows computer is handy. That would really make this unit portable.Overall, this is a great product, and well worth the purchase. The unit can print on tape up to 1" wide.I did notice that for each label printed, a 1" piece was spit out as waste. Overall this unit is a good value and creates great labels.Notes:- You need to flip the little switch on the label maker to change from the Lite Version to the full version of the software.- Printer Driver will not install if you have the switch set for the lite version. The unit cuts off a small bit of label and lets it drop.

My stand-alone unit is limited to one standard font, so I really like this flexibility.

When I received the unit I followed the directions for preparing the printer to be attached to my PC...OK, here's all there was to it:1) Unpack the label printer, and power and USB cords2) Open the label printer and insert the label tape cartridge3) Close the unit and connect the label printer to the power cord4) Connect the USB cord to the unit and to the PC5) The PC (mine runs Windows XP) finds the hardware (this took 2-3 minutes at the most)6) The directions state that you will then be ready to use the label printer, but I received a prompt that I needed to restart my computer to complete the installation process.

I plugged the unit into my Windows XP computer and opted to use the power adapter instead of the AA battery option.
