While I feel that the sharpener does do a pretty good job of sharpening pencils (both #2 and novelty pencils (which notoriously sharpen up badly), my one sticking point is that if the sharpener is going to do the work for me, then I don't want to have to hold it down. If I sharpen without holding it down, the sharpener spins around willy nilly, particularly with new pencils that have never been sharpened. I haven't been able to find a sharpener which successfully stops you from sharpening once it was properly sharpened. This sharpener works as expected. There is no standing at the sharpener for 5 minutes because the pencil tip is all funky and taking forever. What I do like about the sharpener, it makes me appear to be "high Tech" when someone sees it on my desk! When I set this sharpener on the desk and put a pencil in it , as soon as the sharpener touches the blade holder it starts to rotate. You need to hold the sharpener with one hand while inserting the pencil with the other.Most of the time the sharpening blades shave away the pencil wood to a point without any pencil lead showing. The Westcott sharpener works nicely at getting the nice, sharp point and doing it quickly. If you don't the sharpener goes around also. This new sharpener works like a charm. It's a decent sharpener and will do in a pinch but if you want a nice even point without wasting any pencil length you'll need to look elsewhere. Better to have a sharpener that does just that well. You also have to HOLD the sharpener, so it will do its thing with cutting. This neat little sharpener is the size of an average apple. This sharpener has lovely sharp blades and a nice strong motor. It is a nice sharpener if this is what you are looking for. This sharpener struggles with that job. This sharpener probably works great for the average pencil, but it was no match for my graphite and colored pencils.Firstly, I require a SHARP end on both sets of pencils. The sharpener would always leave a small, flat end on all of my pencils. This is a fast and convenient little sharpener. The sharpener is battery operated and requires 4 batteries. Overall, this is a handy little sharpener (and cute too!) This is a pretty good sharpener.
