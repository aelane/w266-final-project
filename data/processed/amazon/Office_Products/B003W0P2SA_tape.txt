What can you say, best tape out there. This tape was a really inexpensive price, and is typical Scotch brand quality. This tape is heavy duty. This tape is far heavier than previously used tapes that kept &#8220;curling&#8221;. What more can you say about tape? This is a great tape but don't use it foolishly since it is expensive. I bought this to use as a tape to secure computer generated postage labels to packages but with today's bar codes on everything from apples to car parts, one may not tape over the code lest the scanners misread them! I did double up the tape, but more out of habit as I normally use their standard shipping tape. The tape is thick, and I have never had it break on me yet, even when moving heavy books.Also, if you are a frequent Amazon shopper like I am, this is the prefect tape to return the couple items you receive over the year that are defective or broken. Well, it's packing tape. This tape costs a little more than the competition but I have never had a problem with it. I can pull the tape off, leaving no residue at all. I have used this packing tape exclusively for the past five years. This tape is strong and sticks perfectly to packages. Not much to say other than it is the best tape i use for packages. Yeah, I know it is tape, but anything you put on your package (bubble wrap, packing paper, etc...) will factor into your overall shipping price. And this little tape did just that. Very clear, strong tape. Catches the tape so you can reuse it without having to try to peel it off again.I think I chipped a tooth... uh oh. The tape closes and seals smoothly and for the price it cannot be beat.The quality of the tape is excellent and it cuts cleanly when using the edge cutter. Very thick and strong, the tape, once cut, rests on two little tabs very nicely so you don't have to play the searching game for it. It's packing tape. We always buy our packing tape form the dollar store. This is sturdy packing tape and at under $3 a roll, a good deal. It's packing tape! This Skotch is probably some of the best tape made. So, I know that you know that if it's Skotch, and it's tape, then it's great. I am very happy with this tape! Also when the tape slips back onto the roll you need the Huble to find the edge, so it's not the nightmare you would experiance with say Saran Wrap. This is exactly the tape I ran out of. I like this tape. Otherwise, I like the tape. I ordered the Scotch Heavy Duty, a smaller tape and copy paper at the same time. The tape itself is fine but the dispenser is very hard to work with, and there's no option not to use it. This is great tape for when you're moving and need to tape up your boxes well. Also, the tape help provides sturdiness for the boxes when you tape them along the edges... this helps prevent the boxes from tearing.The tape stuck to boxes very well and was fairly easy to remove from the... red thing.. whatever it's called. These tape rolls are great to keep around. I have bought tape similar to this only to find that it was too thin and broke easily or it was difficult to dispense. This tape is sturdy and dispenses easily. I couldn't be more happy that this tape does the job perfectly. This tape is thicker, stronger, and can keep my heavy baked goods, books, and care packages sealed tightly with one strip. Anyway, the tape is ok I just wish it were bigger. The tape is easy to take from the dispenser and tear off at the steel serrated edge. Although the tape is clear, it is also very strong.

Very thick tape, but not the stickiest.

Don't get me wrong this tape is strong.. like heavy duty strong.

You really have to make sure this tape stays put on some box materials..
