I suspect the paper feed and paper collection plastic trays could have been engineered better. The paper capacity for the printer is 250 sheets. It does allow you to extend the paper bin out of the machine to accommodate 11x17 paper and comes with a plastic cover to stop dust from piling on the paper over time. I still worry that the paper tray may break, but that's my own hang up....it hasn't broken yet. I would also like to have seen some 13x19 paper samples as well. This paper size comes in different styles and is very expensive as photo paper.Once I got everything set up and ready I printed the test print. Pulling out the paper holder is ratchety at best and I really expected a smooth, gliding function. If Epson would fix the paper tray, I could give it a 5 star rating. I took an A4 legal-size paper and had it automatically reduce to A4-letter with just a simple change.-Its got an automatic document feeder at the top. I have yet to have a paper jam.As to the printing itself, the images are clear, the machine is quiet and all the features work as they should.Copying and scanning also work effectively. The paper tray is located under the control panel and is easy to access.Scanning:There is software that comes with this printer for scanning called ABBYY that I used for scanning documents. Yes, it supports many different paper sizes, but there is only a single tray. Loading paper in the Epson Workforce WF 7510 is almost as time consuming as changing the toner cartridge in my other printer.
