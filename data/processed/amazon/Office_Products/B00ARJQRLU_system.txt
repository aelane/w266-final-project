Before buying this I ordered a similar &#34;defender-usa&#34; system and returned it. This system is similar, two cameras and a 7&#34; monitor which accepts a 32gb SD card. I can't very well use this system. The LW2731 system uses Skype instead, so I can't add it to my camera network. I had the system up and was watching my front door in minutes. I had my system working in 10 minutes literally. The system from what I can tell is a 2.4gtz so its good but your range will be limited most likely. But other than that, it's a pretty good system.

Checked out the system and it looked pretty good.

Then I turned the system off and moved the cameras around the house to see how it looked.

When I turned the system back on it didn't work.
