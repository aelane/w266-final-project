This oil is great, and comes in a size large enough to last for a long time. This is a good oil, but I can't help but think I could have just used canola oil from the kitchen, as this product is labeled vegetable oil. Just Canola oil periodically. I use the oil every bag change or if I haven't used it in a few weeks. Well, this oil is made just for that purpose and it does a great job...highly recommended (and needed if you have a shredder)... I have to assume that this oil is doing what it is supposed to. However, the oil comes out of the nozzle too fast and in too great a quantity. The oil is needed to keep your shredder working properly. The oil goes where you point it. Well it's oil, I'm sure how one can rate this. Now I oil the shredder fairly often, maybe even too often. I got this oil because I read that it really helps shredders work longer. Shredder oil is supposedly specially created so that this won't happen. Very lightweight oil. And since oil is the content it makes a massive mess.I used to buy the Fellowes shredder lubricant in a flip-top bottle that never leaked but I remember that as a more expensive product. I decided to buy this oil because every shredder that i buy ends up in the junk heap no matter how much I pay. Initially thought that the oil was &#34;watery&#34; when squirted into the shredder via the extension nozzle, and that it wouldn't do much... but after one oiling, the shredder seemed to work allot better. Would recommend this over using vegetable oil as that may gum up a shredder. I never have to oil my scissors......wrong. It absorbs oil, water, etc, so when you run it through the shredder, it's going to eventually suck up any lubrication on the cutting wheels.You can use vegetable oils, but that is so messy. I bought the oil and use it regularly.

I originally purchased the oil for the cutters directly from Fellowes a couple of years ago; the bottle was smaller and more expensive at the time.

This oil comes in a plastic container with a nozzle that makes it easy to lubricate the shredder.

I did not use shredder oil on the first one, and after about 1 year use it froze.
