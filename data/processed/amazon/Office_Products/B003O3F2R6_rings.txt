It doesn't sound like much, but this could get annoying if you have to open and close the rings frequently. When it comes to the rings - there is a sacrifice (vs sturdy metal open at one time using lever rings of binders). You can open the rings to customize and move things around.Also - when you flip this open to take notes, it lays flat. And as the rings fill up more, it's harder to get them opened and get new pages in without the other ones already there getting off track, unlike standard binders where the pages tend to stay put better. The rings seemed vulnerable to popping out at inopportune times. But the rings are heavy-duty and can take a lot of abuse. The rings do wear down after a while and occasionally pop out once they're worn, though when the product is new they click in nicely and stay put. I don't like that I have to grab it between the rings. The rings of this binder are plastic and are called &#34;Tech Lock Rings&#34;. The rings are all separately operated. The Flex Hybrid's rings are attached to the back cover of the binder and each one opens individual of the others. It has the standard three rings, but lies flat, open, and folds like a notebook. Unfortunately, the three rings are made of plastic and must be opened individually, which discourages me from taking papers in or out frequently. The rings are plastic without a middle spring-loaded clip. Other than the rings, the binder seems fairly sturdy. I didn't find the rings difficult to open and close, but they are more time consuming to open and close, so if you need to do that frequently, that may be a drawback.

I like these rings a lot, but only time will tell how they will stand, but Five Star does offer a one year warranty.

D-type rings that have to be opened individually, and they open deep towards the bottom, on the right hand side of the D-ring.

The rings for inserted papers and pages are relatively soft plastic, and must be opened one at a time rather than with a single snap of one opening all three together.
