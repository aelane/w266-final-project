The pencil is quickly sharpened to a fine, exact point, without being wasted. I'm an electric pencil sharpener snob. That pencil sharpener broke few years ago when I asked my dad to ship it to me, but he didn't put any padding material in the package, sniffles... What I loved about that one (which serves as the epitome of how a pencil sharpener should work) are: 1) won't let you sharpen beyond the optimal point; 2) sharpened wood and lead is smooth; 3) sharpened pencil is centered. Well, you CAN shove down the pencil hard to force the sharpener to sharpen, but it does sort of stop, and the sharpening sound distinctly changes. Sometimes the pencil doesn't get sharpened at the center, but I've used this enough that I can center it pretty well. This is my first "electric" pencil sharpener so I cannot compare it to any others. This only gets the pencil stuck in the sharpener. This is nice little pencil sharpener. I honestly wasn't expecting much from this pencil sharpener. I had to REALLY hang on to and push the pencil down to keep it from spinning in my hand. One to hold the pencil and one to hold the sharpener as it spins if you don't. I would definitely recommend it if you still love using an old fashioned pencil like I do. I really like this pencil sharpener. I have been wanting an automatic pencil sharpener for school. But, it is not heavy enough to sharpen the pencil without the sharpener spinning around. So you have to hold the pencil and the sharpener. But I still don't have an automatic pencil sharpener. He was using an old manual pencil sharpener and he was wearing pencils down to the nub in no time. If you don't have a mechanical pencil or an electric sharpener this isn't a bad alternative. If you put the pencil in with one hand the torque on the sharpener is enough to try and spin the entire unit around the pencil so you have to hold the unit with one hand and the pencil with the other. This small pencil sharpener packs some punch. Just be warned: if you keep pushing, there won't be much pencil left! Cute and powerful little pencil sharpener! I picked up this pencil sharpener, because it's battery operated. You can't just put the pencil in and that's it. This is a great compact handy pencil sharpener. I, therefore, use a pencil sharpener daily.First of all the shape of this little sharpener is adorable - candy apple red plastic with black = fashionable!This little gem sharpens pencils to a glorious pointy point.Yes, you do need to have a care  because if you don't remove your pencil when the tip is sharper enough then the sharpener will just continue sharpening until you have a  nib remaining!Since  I've never had a pencil sharpener with an " auto stop" feature - this is standard operating procedure.The little housing over the batteries was a tad stiff to remove in order to insert the batteries, but not bad enough that I would ding my rating because of it. Instead of pulling the pencil in like other sharpeners it will just spin around the pencil until you add quite a bit of force to insert it.3.Can eat your pencils. I picked up this pencil sharpener because I like to do graphite drawings and I also use Prismacolor colored pencils. I needed a pencil sharpener for work, as I draw technical diagrams, and do a bunch of math calculations from time to time, so I had been looking for a small pencil sharpener that wouldn't take up too much space and didn't need a cord. After all my many so-so pencil sharpeners, it is nice to finally get one that fits the bill. I thought it wasn't working and then I pulled out the pencil and it was done! First off, this is just a pencil sharpener. Strange - the pencil sharpener arrived with the sharpening part missing!

You would think that pencil sharpeners are pretty straight-forward as far as functionality goes.

Lightly holding the pencil doesn't cut it.

So I was looking forward to trying out this pencil sharpener.
