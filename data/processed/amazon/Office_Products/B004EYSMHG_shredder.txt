While this shredder does not have a separate bin for CDs, nor a window to see paper level shredded, it is considerably cheaper at approximately $64.Time will tell how the Swingline will continue to `stack up' against the competition and whether the cost differential will be justified. This is a superb shredder. But this is a shredder made for personal use and small businesses and there are many other quality cross cut shredders out there that work just as great as this by reputable brands as well that are much cheaper. This Swingline shredder is really very good. I am comparing this shredder with the one being replaced which was very noisy. This shredder also cuts credit cards and thick paper. This is a fine shredder which I got for my office. The shredder does not do that it shreds the CD in its own slot which cuts the CD into 3 pieces now that's fine if you want destroy the CD so it can never be played but I think a lot of times people who want to shred their CDs one on cut up a little bit more disability keep in mind. This shredder cuts paper and credit cards into pieces that are each about 1/8" by 1". I have compared the Swingline shredder herein with the Amazon Basics 12-sheet shredder with virtually the same features and from my experience with the Amazon Basics shredder it would seem to be substantially over-priced. I've been using my shredder for several months now and it is a very high quality and powerful unit! This is a good shredder. This Swingline shredder is a bit small for me, but some people like that, so that is not necessarily a negative, just something to keep in mind when selecting a shredder.I have never owned a shredder with a separate CD/credit card shredder; this Swingline also has a separate container that fits inside the main container for catching the shreds from the CDs and credit cards. My current shredder shreds credit cards, but there is no seperate area for collecting them in order to allow for recycling. I would not generally pay even the $115.00 for a shredder. I like this shredder much better than Swingline's stack and shred shredder, and haven't had problems with paper jams so far. (My Fellowes shredder always fills up faster than I think, and paper will start jamming due to the backed-up bits of paper.) The manual recommends that between shredding you are to turn the shredder on/off button to off.T
