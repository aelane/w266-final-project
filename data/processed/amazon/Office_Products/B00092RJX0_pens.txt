Very pleased with these pens - just switched from Bic Velocity gels after finding a purple Pilot G2 and using it until it ran dry! The pens have a nice rubber grip and it makes it easy to hold and to use.YOu can see easily through the pen how much ink there is left. They are classy pens almost like using an old fountain pen. I bought these pens because the pilot precise V7 pens were so expensive. I love these pens and order them all of the time. Even so I still prefer it over other pens I've used recently.Thanks Pilot! When I get bored of using basic black pens, I enjoy using my multi-colored pens. I love these pens. I have used only gel pens for as long as I can remember. I love pens, and this is my new favorite pen set. The pens write smoothly and are comfortable to hold. If you like gel pens, these are a great brand and you should like them. These pens (you get two in this pack) write a very smooth black script that is fairly narrow(.07); I like the rubber part of the lower section of the pen; it is very comfortable to grip and hold; it has a retractable spring loaded mechanism (I don't particularly like that anymore as it is too easy to accidentally push that top part down and have the ink point mess up your shirt or pants with ink in the "on" position.) These pens are pretty cheap, and a heck of a lot better than BICs or cheap Papermates. These pens are great. These pens fit the bill. The G2 pens are super, if they seem to run out and there is ink in the barrel, shake the pen and voila it's back to life I really like these pens. This is one of my favorite everyday pens. I LOVE these pens. These pens are my favorite! :) The pens write super smoothly and I've been a big fan for many years. I cannot figure out what those pens are. These pens don't run on the paper, and they write fairly smooth. These pens are pretty good pens. What is there to say about these simple yet great pens? You can't go wrong with Pilor G2 pens. These pens do not flow as nicely as the uniball but needed the brown. These pens have lovely colors and I was hoping for fine but they are so fine that they're difficult to enjoy in my case.I won't buy them again & don't enjoy writing or printing with them. their easy to use and much better then ink pens and more clean. I love these pens What can I say about Pilot G2 pens?T
