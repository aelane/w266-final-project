Ink cartridges seem to last a fairly long time. From the time the box opened until I printed the test sheet was less than 5 minutes. However, after spending more time with the XP-800, I'm upping its rating to four stars. When I have time I will have to figure out how to fix this so I can choose between two printers when printing.What I like best is that the XP-800 prints very smoothly and quietly and rapidly. However, the next time I use it, the cassette extends outward as usual.The wireless connection was easy to set up, no difficulty at all. The only time Epson Connect was down for maintenance, they sent advance notice via email with plenty of notice. I'll have to wait and see over time how capacity compares.Setup is a breeze, but I've never had a printer that was a problem that way, so it's not like this is anything stellar compared to all the rest. This was the first time I've ever had a problem with installation. )This time, it only took twenty minutes. Only time will tell I suppose.The other thing I found a little annoying was, like some other reviewers mentioned, are the paper trays. As I noted with the Workforce 2540, it probably takes more time for remove all of the packing tape than any other step. I am a long time Epson printer user and prefer them over any other brand, so I was excited to try out this latest model all-in-one printer from Epson. The set up time included taking the printer out of the box, removing packing materials, installing the ADF and ink cartridges, installing the printer driver / software, and connecting it to my wireless network.Once set up, you can still print and scan wirelessly, and you still have an option for mobile/cloud printing.

Only time will address this.Out of the box, there was lot of blue tape to remove.

Every time I looked for something in the site, it gave me all the steps after I had the email address.

It was my personal first time use...
