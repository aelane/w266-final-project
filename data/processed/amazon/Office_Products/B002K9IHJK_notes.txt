Compared to regular Post-it notes, the entire backing of these labels is adhesive. They are basically heavy-duty Post-It notes that are good for labeling binders, as nametags, or really anything else that you need them for. They can easily be used as regular Post-It notes, but the whole note is sticky instead of having a small sticky portion (there is a non-sticky part so you can peel them away from each other, and then you tear that non-sticky part off). I admit to being one who has long used Post-It notes as temporary (and sometimes not-so-temporary) labels for things like file boxes. I've used these for semi-perminent notes on my laptop. This are not your normal sticky notes. These are amazing as I find myself using more and more sticky notes!Often times when I place a post it in a book or on the calendar something happens weather it falls off, blows in the breeze or something and you wonder when they will make them with an entire sticky back??? These are like post-it notes with removable adhesive on the entire backside rather than just a small strip. These are the perfect notes for placing information on a larger container rather than the standard sizes we grew up with. When I first received these, I looked at 'em and though "Meh, they're Post-It notes - what's the big deal"?To an extent, that's what they are. I use Post-It notes all the time for just about everything and I think this is a great idea. Goodbye post-it notes that come off shortly after application; hello, supersticky yet removable label pads! We are all aware of sticky notes (paper with a thin line of sticky tape on the back) and permanent labels (non-removable). I put Post-It notes, the kind with cute designs like this one Post-it Notes By 3m, Super Sticky - Leaf Water Droplet Design, 1 Pack of 75 Sheets 3 7/8 Inches By 3 7/8 Inches on my Christmas List cause I think they're so cool. If you have ever wished you had some stick notes that had more stick to them then you've got your wish. If you've ever had sticky notes that don't stick very well or get knocked off easily where you've put them then these are great. These Post-it notes would also work well for outdoor yard sale price tags on big items. Regular Post-it notes tend to detach in any moderate wind, but these would stick even in a full gale--although I didn't actually TRY that! Unlike regular post-in notes, it stays very firmly on whatever surfaces you put on. Like Post-it notes, these are a great product and I bet they will become just as popular. I use post-it notes all the time, so I was glad to see this product. Regular post-it notes do not work well as a labeling system for these containers. Older Post-It notes were only sticky on one edge, which made them useless in many situations, especially for long-term note storage. Now, Post-It has come up with just the notes for this -- super sticky labels that you can remove. I have reviewed several of the Avery sticky notes of this sort, ones that are stickier than regular notes, still removable, with the adhesive covering the entire back surface. Just as the commercial demonstrates these sticky notes adhere to most hard surfaces and can be removed many times over. Basic Post-it notes cannot hold a candle to these and I will find it pretty difficult on going back to the regular stuff. I got the Post-it Super Sticky Label Pads to try as I am constantly using sticky notes everywhere. I'm constantly writing myself little notes and sticking them on the cabinet on my desk.
