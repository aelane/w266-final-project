I will update as time goes on but for now this is for photos, the MX512 is the only scanner with a paper feeder which is great when you have to scan more then 1 thing and still can print a mean photo when needed for something less then framing like for a school project, and the MP490 will keep on being the everyday printer! This has only happened to me one time, and it was because I didn't use the extender and was printing multiple sheets. Setup wastes so much time. That will undoubtedly change in due time. Only time can tell if this Canon PIXMA MG5420 has a longer printer head life. When it gets over the warm-up time, the actually printing time itself is pretty fast. If the slow warm-up time does not bother you, then I would say this is a fair entry level All-in-one at this price level. It takes a long time to get started. It just worked the first time. However, at this time, a full set of replacement cartridges (by Canon) will cost you about $69.This Canon device has a minor warming/startup process that produces some noise. It really does take a long time (over a minute if it hasn't been used in a while), compared to other printers I've had, to start printing after hitting print.It's sleek, but pretty wide for a home printer at 18"The textured black top is a dust magnetall of the functions didn't work when using the wireless connection, like the ink indicatorsome reviews said it was thrifty on ink, but two of the color levels went down considerably after just a few 4 x 6 photos, so I'm not sure about how long the colors will last.
