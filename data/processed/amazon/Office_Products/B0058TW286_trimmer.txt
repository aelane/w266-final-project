The trimmer is very easy to use and it cuts like butter. I used to have a same sized trimmer (different brand) in plastic, and it broke after I attempted to cut many sheets at once. I was very disappointed; this trimmer has not given me the same results.I tried 12 sheets at once with this, and it trimmed nicely and evenly. Other than that, this trimmer is one sharp and solid product. I'm very happy with this trimmer! This trimmer is great! When I'm not using the trimmer, I can put on the blade lock and not worry about cutting my fingers. The trimmer is large, so you will need a pretty big space for it. If you need a metric trimmer, you can certainly use it, but it is clear that this trimmer was made primarily for inch measurements.6. This is a pretty solid, heavy-duty but lightweight trimmer.

The trimmer easily cuts 15 sheets with little to no force, and will cut 30 sheets (advertised) but requires medium to hard force.

This trimmer should be taken into consideration when you are looking at a purchase.
