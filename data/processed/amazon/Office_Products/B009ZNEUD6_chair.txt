This chair is strong and sturdy and I really like the attractive polished (brushed) aluminum base and arms. The punematic chair post dropped right in.When I got my mits on the shiny base I was delighted to find it was made out of aluminum, and not brittle plastic. Get the chair on a hefty markdown; otherwise, take a look at other models in the $600 to $900 range.Compared to $60 and $90 chairs down at the local Staples or Office Max, though, the Lota lifts head and shoulders above them all. This chair arrived in a pretty damaged and somewhat flimsy box, but the parts were all there and the assembly was easy enough. We absolutely love this chair compared to the stationary one we had at our desk before. It's also an aesthetically pleasing chair to be certain. So I was really excited to try out the HON chair, and so far my impressions have been largely positive. The chair didn't have too many parts that needed to be assembled together, but it did require some dexterity and experience in working with small tools. This chair is particularly well suited for more public office environment, or the places where there is a high-volume use of office equipment. First off, this chair was packaged the way you would expect a return to be packaged. Sitting in the chair was fairly comfortable although not without some unease as a result of poor manufacturing and packing.Now that Hon has sunk to the bottom of quality manufacturing I will no longer purchase any of their products for my office. Now THIS is a real chair!! I can't imagine why you'd design a chair like this!Functionality:  The seat is SUPER firm and flat without any contouring. Let's say you were standing up and you wanted to move your chair by pulling on the arm. This chair seems sturdy and well-constructed, though I have a note about the assembly (see below). The chair is extremely comfortable. That said, I find this chair very comfy. This chair heats up me arse and turns it into a tropical jungle. When I fart in my fancy chair at the office it flies right through the comfortable mesh and quickly dissipates. If you need a chair where the arms need to go low to fit under a desk, I'm not sure this is the chair for you.I would classify the cushion as firm (at least for now) which is nice for me but I get up and walk around a lot at work and it might be too firm for someone putting in 8+ hour days in a chair. or 2: very good and expensive.This chair is in the good and expensive category.The cushion is superb, very very firm but very comfortable, out of about 8 hon chairs, this cushion is my favorite.
