These are file folders! While these are fairly thin, my file folders seldom get put to much stress while residing in our file cabinet or when sitting my desk.These are perfectly functional for my needs and are a fairly good value as well!Recommended!CFH What can I say about folders? If you're going to max the folders out with paperwork, you may want to get a heavier stock, they're a little flimsy. I expected these folders to be flimsy because of the relatively low price but they are as sturdy as they come. These folders are solid and work well. I usually use folders once, as I sharpie mark the tabs, so don't need heavy dutyfolders.These are just what I was looking for, and the quality is more than adequate, andwith a hundred of them, should last a very long time. They are folders, nothing amazing, nothing out of this world, nothing revolutionary, I think it was cheap, that might be why I bought it. folders what can i saythey work great and hold a lot of papersgood for organizing and they fit good in my file cabinet

The folders are great and would get 5 star except I've found that a few of them may end up bent during packing when I've ordered them personally or for work.

These are file folders, and I use them for light filing.
