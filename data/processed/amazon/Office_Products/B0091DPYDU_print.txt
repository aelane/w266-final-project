This replaced an Epson Workforce 840 that ended up unusable due to clogged print heads. The print quality continues to be very good and it is fast! It feeds print jobs or scan jobs automatically, so you don't have to feed pages one at a time. Set up was relatively easy too.The print quality for this machine is stunning, especially compared to a HP printer (within the same price range and with similar features) that my family owns. The print outs look great. The print qaulity is really good, and being able to print both side of a paper is also a plus it also has a handy SD slot and several formats. The print speed and quality are fast and good. The Epson Workforce WF-3540 Color Inkjet Wireless All-In-One (print, copy, fax, scan) is an excellent product that, so far, has satisfies all of my business needs.Everything about the product -- from its packaging through its many product features -- represents high quality. The print quality is very good, but once in a while I get streaks, but all that has required me to do is clean the ADF screen. Why does this happen?A: To keep the print head clear and ready to print, the printer uses a small amount of ink from all the cartridges whenever it prints. The print head needs to be kept charged to prevent air bubbles from entering. The print quality can be adjusted to suit your needs ranging from draft to presentation quality.Negatives - this does have a larger footprint than most printers but a much smaller footprint than other all-in-one printers.Overall, I have to give this a five star review. It also features Epson Connect, which lets you print and scan remotely from anywhere you are, and Goggle cloud print, which lets you print from your android phone remotely and even lets you allow others to print to your Epson.Be sure and bookmark the complete User's Guide at Epson dot com.

Epson provides a print yield after the first set of cartridges has primed the machine.

Epson Connect allows me to print and scan from anywhere, and I can email print directly to this printer from anywhere using its own personal email address!
