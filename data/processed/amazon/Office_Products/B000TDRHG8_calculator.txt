It's very hard to review a calculator because they tend to have so many functions and features that it's hard to do a quick review on it. This calculator doesn't have memory expansion although it is programmable.I do wish that they had put the stack manipulation buttons closer to the Enter Button, that's my biggest gripe.Overall, if you grew up in the 70s or 80s, this is a great updated calculator to the titans of that era. The 35s is an outstanding scientific calculator for a great price. The HP35s is the second HP scientific calculator which I have purchased since  X'mas 2003. I purchased this calculator to replace a 50g that I bought, but really didn't like or use very much. I have been an HP calculator user for over 25 years. This calculator is powerful enough for most daily number-crunching, but is simple enough for regular use without becoming tiresome (the 50g for example). This calculator to me represents HP attempt to regain some of their former glory in the calculator world, and in my opinion they have achieved their goal. The calculator feels a bit more fragile than the earlier generation and is missing some of the well thought out HP calculator innovations that the earlier alphanumerics, such as the legendary HP-41, hhad. Now the calculator has hung-up with SYNTAX ERROR. It's got to be hard being a calculator salesperson these days. Classic HP calculator quality, it feels solid and the buttons work as well as should be expected for a serious math instrument.It is switchable between RPN and Algebraic input, which is a huge plus.
