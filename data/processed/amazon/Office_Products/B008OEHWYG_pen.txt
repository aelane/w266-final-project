A pen that is not only a pleasure to write with but has ink that does not smear easily, that is what I am looking for. Each pen's color is indicated by the tip of the cap as well as the bottom of the pen making it easy to pick out which pen you need. Overall, a really nice pen set in five beautiful, rich colors, that would be great for any type of writing, including letters, envelopes, scrapbooking and journaling. The pen and ink provide a very fine, smooth, silky finish. Furthermore, this pen does not feel as comfortable in the hand (a vague complaint, to be sure). This isn't my first Uniball pen. They're definitely not worth $3+ a pen. This is one reliable pen. I wish I could: a comfortable pen with beautiful ink is a pleasure, but blotting, smearing and scratching is a nuisance. When I stopped and gave the pen a moment or two, the ink would continue to flow as usual. This is indeed a great pen for signing checks or legal documents.The pens are quite attractive - neither cheap-looking or expensive looking, with the color of the ink incorporated into the design of the pen so it is easily apparent.They are thicker than the average daily-use pen, but not overly thick.
