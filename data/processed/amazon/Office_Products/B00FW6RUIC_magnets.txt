The magnets hold it in place on my fridge very well. You'll also get two magnets(which I think are the cutest part of the board.) The supplied magnets are strong enough to hold it up properly without it moving around.Important:  To get the most out of this board, turn it sideways! However the magnets provided to attach to the back of the board are really weak. The magnets are very cute, though. You also have to assemble the magnets to the back so that you can attach it to your refrigerator or other magnetic surface. The magnets are so weak that the slightest bump moves the board. I attempted to add 2 magnets similar in size to the ones that come with the board. It comes with two nice magnets which is OK; also a mark/eraser which, I must confess, I have not used. I used the magnets to hang it on the side of my refrigerator. First off, I love the magnets. the magnets that come with it are OK, it is nice to have the little strip of cork to use but the board does not come with any thumb tacks so you need to buy those too. I had to reinforce it with other magnets I had laying around. The magnets do not come pre-assembled so you can position them as needed.The good:- it is a great idea to have one of these available to write things on for other parties in your house- The white board part works great and is in itself magnetic, so you can use the two magnets to hang some extra stuff on- The mini dry eraser fits well on the board and writes wellThe bad:- The frame is a bit cheesy, it has very obvious cheap plastic looking connectors where the corners are put together- The magnets are not strong enough. There are also two decorative magnets you can use to hold things on the magnetic dry erase board, though again, I don't think the board is big enough for that purpose. The magnets are not strong enough to support the weight of the board.With that, I had to take the magnets and adhesive off. I especially like that you can use either magnets or markers on the white board.
