I laminated my paper insurance card and other ID cards. They really work best with paper documents. I used to use clear contact paper to laminate things....not so hot. The paper backing has a grid on it which is helpful when cutting the sheets to a smaller size, especially using a paper cutter. I wish I'd had these for my old paper library cards!These particular laminating sheets, however, are NOT very thick. I switched from regular paper to cardstock, then laminated that and the end result was perfect.I've been using the new tags now for a few months and they've held up just as well as the heat sealed versions, which means I don't have to pony up a bunch of cash for a new heat laminator. The old paper was an odd size (not 4x6, 5x7 or 8x10), so I had to cut the laminating sheets to fit. It was so easy to peel the paper off the back of a sheet, place the document on it that I wanted laminated and then smooth it out.

However unless you have a large dedicated "paper cutter" it may be difficult to cut a straight edge (depending of course upon your skill wielding scissors).As other reviewers have noted, these are not for making stiff ID cards.

Works well on paper.

The laminating paper itself is easy to cut so you can trim your projects easily.I would recommend these for school projects and newspaper clippings or other small personal keepsakes.
