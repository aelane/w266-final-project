There really isn't much to say:  assuming you have decent label printing software, these labels label. When it's an Avery label! A label isn't something that cannot be improved upon and Avery continues to be the leader in the finish of the actual label, the adhesives, and their "TrueBlock Technology" which makes the label 100% opaque to anything under it. If they get wet before I try to remove the label, some adhesive has to be scrubbed off.I doubt Avery matters for the freezer application, but if you want a professional result for more traditional uses, Avery and name brand printer toner are a must.I've tried several different generic brands -- from all three big office retailers -- and the letters get smeared or flake off when applying the labels. I usually just remove the label if I'm going to re-use a file folder, because I'm just going to covering up the damaged area with another label anyway. The perfect label. Used over an existing label or writing, they are truly opaque. I just applied the new label to the old paper label insert and then folded over the excess.I recommend that you investigate the "Design and Print Online" feature available on Avery's website. Searching Amazon, I find that there is also a 1500 label package but I don't see anything smaller than the 750 size. The label is the perfect height for the tabs on hanging file folders, but it a bit too long, so I just fold it over the back and it works perfectly.

Since I usually print only one label at a time, I'm pleased a sheet will go through the printer many times correctly.

A label is a label, whats the point?

2) If you try and remove the label on your file folders, they do not easily release and you'll peel off some of your file folder with the label.Again, this may be a useful product, but very disappointing that Avery continues to outsource all their customer support and manufacturing!
