This laminator is one of those things you wonder how you lived without before. I wanted a laminator primarily for use when creating hiking/climbing maps I print out on an ink jet printer using Topo! I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this laminator. It's my first laminator, so I'm not sure that it's unusually so when compared to other similar units. Obviously, this compact laminator is limited to letter size, but for such a size this is an excellent product with.Recommended for smaller jobs. What this is:- A solid, well built laminator meant to be usedWhat this is not:- a light weight, cheap home laminator (hence, the $160+ price)The unit is solid, heavier than I expected. This laminator does take a while to cool down, so keep that in mind when pulling it out to use it. I liked the laminator. Right now I would give this new laminator 4 stars; the first one zero stars if possible.
