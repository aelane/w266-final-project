When you need  a piece of tape there is no fumbling with a tape dispenser while trying to hold the paper to the package, you simply give a gentle tug to an exposed pre-cut two-inch piece of tape and it frees itself from the dispenser. Occasionally a piece of tape will stick when you pull it out, pulling more than one strip out at a time, but this was the exception. It is right there, with the next piece of tape just waiting to be pulled.If I had to rate this product based solely on the elimination of the common problem associated with misplacing the tape dispenser, this simple device would easily earn five stars. You get a perfect sized piece of tape, and you can use it one handed! while you tear off a piece of tape from a regular disposable dispenser). Grabbing a piece of tape couldn't be simpler. This makes it hard to remove a piece of tape from the dispenser. Doing so leaves you with a pre-cut piece of tape, with some of the adhesive scraped off (or with visible scratches on the non-adhesive side), and which doesn't lie as flat and invisibly as would be nice for present wrapping (presumably what you'd need a wrist-mounted one-handed tape dispenser for).Also worth noting - unlike with a box of kleenex or a post-it pad, leaving half a piece of tape hanging in the air for a while will degrade it's adhesive - so the first piece of tape you remove from the dispenser after using it for a while will only be sticky for about half its length.Still - where other designs are available for a one-handed tape dispenser? You get the perfect piece of tape and a new piece automatically comes out and is waiting for you next time! If you need a long piece for some reason, it's not happening with these. If you need a longer piece, you're out of luck. And if you need a smaller piece, you have to go hunt for scissors, which negates the purpose. Not to mention you have to try tearing a perfect piece of tape all over again- meaning you are losing time as well as tape! Once loaded, you merely touch the piece of tape sticking out with one finger and it's out and ready to tape! Each piece of tape is 3/4" by 2 inches long, which I found to be adequate, but I would love it if they could make the tape 2 1/2 inches long, which is more what I am used to! One piece of precut tape is always ready. Sometimes, however, more than one piece of tape comes out as a continuous stream if you don't pull fast enough.This product is good because it potentially reduces the amount of tape you will use for projects, especially when wrapping gifts.
