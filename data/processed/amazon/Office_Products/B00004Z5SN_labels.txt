These laser labels print well, don't smear, and stick well to envelopes.Why did I give them a 4* review? When I tried this, the top labels stuck out fine, but the sheet didn't quite fold on the line so the bottom labels didn't stick out as well. These labels are really awesome.Convenient, practical, good quality, and they make life easier. These labels can do so many things and you can use them for so many reasons - the list is endless.Highly recommended for office, home, school, workshop, playroom, etc. These labels work great for my needs. These labels are nice. Avery labels are easy to use, rarely smudge, and peel off easily. I use address labels for addresses (obviously), but also for all sort of things. Overall these are very good labels and my complaint doesn't really count since they directions say not to run the sheet of labels through the printer more then once, but I do. Great labels. These labels are no exception. I would recommend these labels and I would buy them again! Yes, these labels are just as they are described, but even better than I expected.From past experience with printing labels, I figured I'd have to spoil a few sheets to "get the system zeroed-in. Anytime you have to print labels, look to these Avery labels. I print a few labels at at time on a page so I may often put the same sheet back in my printer several times. The labels did not get stuck in the printer.As the sheet includes just labels (no margins), they peeled off easily and could be subsequently appliedquickly and neatly to the envelopes. I use labels on a regular basis, be it in the office or at home. Now Avery has enhanced the labels by making them smudge proof and easy to peel. And these labels really are that. These labels worked flawlessly in our printer, then just bend the backing and the edges of each label are there and ready to be peeled.Cut my labeling time nearly in half!I was a bit concerned that "easy peel" would mean "not sticky", but the labels adhered nicely to the envelopes, with no corner lifting at all.Great product! These are good, standard solid labels from Avery - template suggestions are always on the package (so helpful) and I've used both the 3M version, Avery version, and branded store versions (like Office Depot) - they all work well as address labels - if you are wondering how to choose, I'd make your decision based on price, and features such as the Easy Peel (which makes using a LOT of these go much faster - think Christmas card mailings, wedding/shower invitations, etc)...as well as other features like (is it for a LASER or INKJET) printer? )I've been using Avery labels for over a decade, and this latest generation is a marked improvement. These labels don't have that "remainder" - just the labels. It makes peeling off the labels easier, cleaner and faster.They fed fine on my laser printer and inkjet.People that complain about smudging on the 1st page need to clean the printer more often with a cleaning sheet, or pre-feed heavier stock. I highly recommend these labels. These labels are great - good quality, the ink doesn't run on them, and they peel off easily from the backing.They are a nice, bright white and are suitable for professional use. These Avery labels are easy to use. These particular labels use their 5160 template even though the box says 5260 on it. You can print 30 labels per sheet. As advertised, each is easy to remove.If you are looking for white labels for use on a laser printer, these are perfect for addressing envelopes. They are cumbersome to use if you only want to generate a few labels at a time, but if you need them in large quantity, this is the way to go. They are very good labels. These 1" x 2 5/8" labels have many uses.

The Avery Easy Peel Address Labels are pretty good labels for the printers.

These labels work perfectly.

They are address labels, but you can use them for a variety of different reasons.
