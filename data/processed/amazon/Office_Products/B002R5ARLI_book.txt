that being said, the book is very nice and high-quality, but it's not a replacement of a real math (or arithmetic) textbook. but if you're not creative enough or is so math-phobic, then this book could help you introduce math to your young child. It's not just a book of numbers but features colorful, clean and pleasant graphics and features some fun activities to develop counting skills (cut out some pictures arrange them) and some early math. I would definitely recommend this book for anyone wanting to give their pre-school aged child a head start on their number writing skills. The book only teaches 0-9, so if that's a problem for you, then don't buy it. I read through the book and showed it to my husband. While the book does cover simple addition and subtraction, today's Kinder classes are covering more advance concepts such as "Why is it addition?" This book lacks the coverage of basic concepts such as adding on, why 5 = * * * * *, and completely skips addition, moving stright into abstract subtraction. This book is simple enough for a preschooler to work on with an adult. This book is prefect for preschool children. The book's recommendation that it is suitable for students up to the 2nd grade seems a bit off as I think most kids will have already covered this material in school by then. Unfortunately the book seems to be geared more for preschool aged children. In every book I've seen the stories are not helpful because they are little poems that take way longer to say than it takes to make the letters. This book was very fun and educational for my daughter. Perhaps this would be a good book to take on a long car ride (bring scissors and a glue stick), and discard when it was mostly done. I figured we'd give this book a try and see if she'd be game for learning to write her numbers. Surprisingly, she loves this book. The book is extremely colorful and has a lot of content. This book certainly won't hurt to try, and for the most part, I enjoyed going through it with my kids. I got this book for my son who is really small 15 months.He manages to say 1 2 3 and is learning numbers till 10.He also knows finger counting.So I thought this book would be a step in the right direction. If you want to continuously teach this book and your child is in kindergarten you may not be able to. book for a few years now with my pre-schoolers, I finally got around to using this book with the older children. I got this book to use with a student with special needs. To be fair - I used this book with my preschooler and found it a bit (but not terribly) over her head. Most of this book is dedicated to proper number writing (a la handwriting/printing practice). This book is about learning to write and form letters/numbers and then early math. With this book why wasn't asked much because she could see why.
