The new colors are not very useful for me (I write on legal pads most of the day), but they colors themselves are better than expected. THe beautiful colors are a bonus. Definitely different colors but dark enough to always be very legible. If uninterested in colors, I would suggest theuni-ball Vision Elite Stick Bold Point Roller Ball Pens, 4 Black Ink Pens (67180PP), which are amazing pens. The colors are bold enough to use for regular writing, but also colorful enough to use for editing or marking up black printed font. They are just different enough from the normal black or blue to be "different", but they're not overly bright flashy colors. They are dark, rich colors that provide good contrast against white or yellow paper; it is easy to read a page full of writing. It's more like gliding than writing.These new colors are wonderful. I like wild colors, but sometimes feel like I should have some more "normal" colored pens. The colors in the variety pack were great - all usable for business or casual writing.The not-so-good: As a left-handed writer, a pen's ability to avoid smudging is quite important. The colors are listed as "black-infused" - as a result, the red, brown and green are indeed dark tinted (the brown ink *looks* more black than brown), something which users may prefer or dislike, depending on how colorful they wish their writing to be. The colors are not too bright so they won't hurt my eyes when I review my notes for the book reviews that I do. And the colors! The colors are rich and fun! I was wrong.The colors can best be described as "muddy". These colors are just plain ugly and unappealing.My daughter received a no-name set of 50 rollerball pens in different colors as a gift a few years ago. The colors are attractive and more adult, rather than cutsie as a child would love. I could barely distinguish some colors from each other and they really didn't, to my eyes, match the description. The colors are deep and rich--much more jewel-toned than the picture. The colors are pretty and I can write so easily with them. If you want different colors of ink, these are really nice and rich. The colors are unusual, which makes them good for notes which need to stand out: important info on a desk calendar, labels, notetaking for a class. Just be aware that the colors are very saturated and not at all bright. Actually, all the colors are less than impressive. The colors are all satisfyingly dark and rich. But these colors are dignified enough I can envision using even the red pen to sign my checks.The pens are fairly attractive. I was thrilled to see these being offered in new colors. They are not bright bold girly colors (I like them too) but muted rich colors. Funny how now it is just the opposite!Overall I would probably get these again just for the colors. The colors are nice, and the pens write very smoothly.I would definitely purchase these pens again, I am pretty picky about my pens, and these were right up my alley! If you can't see the colors, they are of course purple, blue, red, green and brown, which I thought looked like gold,and when I wrote with it, I see mostly black..but then, I looked a bit more and I do see a very dark brown lurking in there somewhere!It doesn't take a lot to make me happy and if it makes my work life go a bit smoother and I get the feeling of a new toy, it's got 2 thumbs up from me! Each of the five mixed with black, the colors are a delight: dark, rich and subtle. They're grownup colors, sophisticated enough to use in almost any application. The colors that came in the package are blue, brown, green, purple, and red and because of the inclusion of black in the colors they have a different slightly muted look as opposed to other pens with colored inks that tend to shout their color at you.Also the pen writes smoothly which means that if you write extensively with it, your hand won't tire quickly.Highly recommend this product. I like that all the colors are dark enough to see easily (very important for my aging eyes), but the colors aren't so dark you can't see which color you're using on the paper. I love the colors and how they fit in my hands. I often use the different colors for various crafts and odd papers.The ink doesn't feel unnecessarily vibrant, or obnoxiousness hues that are difficult to read. I especially like the bold colors. I need the colors to differentiate what plants I am using and the different parts of the landscape and the bold colors really make to design pop.The ink flows very nicely and has not smeared. Not only are these colors beautiful, they are unique.Each is infused with black so it has a depth and richness I haven't seen before.The point is medium and writes boldly and smoothly, which makes them perfect for holiday or birthday cards,  journaling, art projects, and signing letters or documents.I am a die-hard Pilot G2-07 user, but I will enjoy using these for their flair.A great present for your favorite calligrapher. The colors are rich and dark (this is a multi-color set) and the writing is smooth.The pen itself is a nice width that doesn't stress my little hands and these actually have a textured area where you grip to give a better grip when writing. The colors are unique: blue/black; brown/black; green/black; purple/black; and red/black. They are dark colors with a hint of the cap color, except for the red, which is obviously red. So these colors are different from what is normally on the shelf, and they are beautiful!Finally, the uni-ball creates a smooth, unbroken line with no drips, no smudges, and no breaks in the writing, and at the same time, the ink dries fast so there is no smearing or nasty ink on your fingers or hands.Just an excellent product! The five colors are rich, and because of their blend with black are quite dark, not bright and tacky.The red is a brownish red -an excellent choice for teachers and editors who don't want to use a flashy red for corrections. The colors are blended, and the description of each color shows that it it blended with black. That means that the colors are subdued yet bold, but not flashy. They write smoothly without skipping, and the colors do not smudge. I'm glad that the colors are ones I would actually want to use. The colors are a nice touch.The ink dries very quickly, though not instantly- especially on slick surfaces. The colors are very vibrant and not light at all; any of them are suitable for official documents, checks, etc.Uni-ball has always been good with ink flow, from start to finish. They are not typical pen colors but I love them because I like to journal in different colors and these suit me perfectly. Those who prefer conventional colors might not really like these though.The ink flows well and the barrel is light which is a big plus for me as I don't care for heavyweight pens.

The 5 colors in this assortment are infused with black ink, and this gives the color a unique appearance.

Imagine colors half-way to black for brown, purple, green, blue, and red.Airplane safe ink: Well, I didn't test this myself by taking my pens on a plane ride.

They are classy looking and the colors are unlike anything I've used before (other than the blue, which is very reminiscent of blue-black fountain pen ink).
