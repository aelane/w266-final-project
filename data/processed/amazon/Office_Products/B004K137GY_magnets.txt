With the magnets attached, it's 7/8&#34; thick... nearly 50% thicker then the second thickest whiteboard I've ever owned.Other then that, the board itself is as expected and the marker comes off with very little effort, so it 'works' well. Two magnets are included, mine had a striped rainbow appearance, not silver as illustrated. The magnets and the pastel blue border really gave this product a &#34;kid feel.&#34;The Amazon description calls this a 9x11 inch magnetic whiteboard (frames may vary). The magnets that hold it onto my fridge do hold it there, but not strongly. The two magnets that hold things on the front surface are only strong enough to hold paper. The magnets simply aren't strong enough to hold the weight. I do not know why they used such weak magnets for the back side because don't most people stick this to their fridge? The two magnets stick well enough to the board, although we don't use that feature much.As many have mentioned, the magnets are not a good way to mount this as it won't stick well to iron parts because the magnets are week. The magnets were easy to apply with the included stickies but they aren't very strong. The magnets that are supplied to mount the board to a metal surface just do not work well on my refrigerator which is where I wanted to place it. When we applied the magnets to the side of a smooth metal file cabinet the board stayed up ok but started to slide a little if you touched it too much.The little decorative magnets that come with the set are cute but we just stuck them on our fridge - there's not a lot of room to write on the whiteboard and add a piece of paper with a magnet too, we just use the board for writing. I stuck the magnets to the board as directed, making sure to face the magnets in the right direction. It just slides down and off.If you don't want to use the magnets, adhesive pads are provided. The magnets stick to it no problem. It comes with 2 colorful magnets you can use to post paper notes.
