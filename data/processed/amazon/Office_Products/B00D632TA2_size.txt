The Quartet Cork Bulletin Board is the perfect size for a kitchen or home office bulletin board. It has good size and solid construction for the price point. Good size, decent quality for the price. It is a nice size and works well in his room! I was drawn to it's size. I really like the size of this board. Prefect size for my needs. The size is good and cork is solid. It's a nice size, not too big and not too small; it's just right for me. Plus the size is nice because things don't get crowded or overlap. It is very lightweight and the size is generous. It looks nice, is a good size size - big, but not too big-  it's lightweight, and inexpensive. It is light for its size and comes with the mounting hardware.The cork is soft enough that you won't struggle (nor will your child) struggle to push the pins into, but not so soft that it falls apart.
