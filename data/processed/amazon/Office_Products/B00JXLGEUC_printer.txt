I do have another printer that the envelopes can go into a tray in the front, I have my printers in a bookcase so its hard to have to slide this out to feed in envelopes. *After owning this printer for two months-and having regular printing needs-I replaced the ink with Epson cartridges only to discover the nozzles were clogged. The printer does the rest.The paper tray holds a LOt of paper you'll be refilling it less often than with older models. I always run out of black in first, and the printer software will ask you if you would like to use some of your color ink to mix it together to make a black ink to keep printing for a little longer. Since I use eFax, I have not tried faxing with this machine.Unfortunately this printer is a bit of an ink hog. This has proved to be an excellent printer for us! This is a fantastic printer, but I have some qualms with it.First the good:* The print quality is great. This printer has twice the paper capacity (even if it's not in one tray) and the larger color touch screen on the control panel really is nice. This Epson printer required a download of their mobile app from the Google Play store for my Galaxy Note phone and the Epson Print Plug In from the Amazon App store for my Fire HDX tablet. Overall, I like this printer a great deal. Unpacking and setup both went smoothly as I connected the printer to my wifi network, entering my password on the printer's keypad. This printer is a nifty little workhorse and might be fine for some. The printer itself doesn't give you any information about this, you have to go to the start up manual, which also doesn&#699;t tell you much except to go to the Epson website and figure it out for yourself.I did not try the Fax machine since I don&#699;t have a land line anymore.Overall an excellent all-in-one system for a very reasonable price. I suppose it fits, as this printer's strength is the all-in-one capabilities. I previously kept my printer on a tall dresser, and had no problem using it, but with this one, you need to look down on the controls, so we had to move it. This printer has the smallest ink cartridges of the 3. Some of the printer setting options would cause Firefox to hang so badly that the whole Firefox process required restarting (using Task Manager).After verifying that my truly excellentEpson WorkForce 645 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printerhad no difficulty printing labels, I decided that the WF-3640 software must be corrupted. We are using this printer in a small office environment and so far are happy with it and have not run into any snags with it.Set up was simple and fairly quick.The print quality is above average and definitely adequate for the basic print jobs we use it for.It is not complicated to use and has user-friendly controls.I like how much paper it is capable of loading. However&#8212;I was pleased with the old printer and used it on a daily basis, and so far I am loving the newer version. My printer was defective upon arrival -- I could not complete the initial setup due to error 0xE8 (undocumented anywhere in Epson support materials or elsewhere on the Web) or (when that error didn't occur) paper jam errors. It looks like a nice printer with a lot of great features and once I receive a working unit I can write a more meaningful review. This printer satisfies this requirement nicely and setup was fairly quick however my husband had a spot of difficulty getting the ink cartridges in and needed to go online to get it done correctly.I took care of the wireless setup by downloading the software from Epson which made the wireless setup easy enough. This printer touchscreen interface is easy and very fast compared to prior printers I've owned. I've never had a printer that worked this fast and it's helpful because we have make a lot of copies and do a lot of faxing for home-officing.There is an easy-open back panel that allows you to fix any paper jams which is really nice.There are two large paper-holding trays which is important to us because we print a lot.Aesthetically, it's very pleasing to the eye and looks first-rate. Just a great printer. I was impressed by this printer. Basically you just unpack the printer, plug the printer in and power on. This is very helpful to me because I'm able to put the printer in any room that I choose (including the basement as I do at times) and print from anywhere in the house. I love this printer!! It stinks.So when I was able to request this printer, I jumped on it. The printer gives you a URL to enter in your browser so you can access the online services. I hope this solves our printer problems. Epson had made this printer more economical to use over the previous similar models.

You'll need to identify the printer's local IP address from the network settings screen, then enter that address into a browser.

This has worked perfectly.I'm very pleased with this printer.

I also love that the printer is wireless.If I were to change anything, I suppose I'd want the otherwise quite accessible &#34;Start Here&#34; guide to also talk us through setting up the various options to be found at epson(dot)com/iPrint, or at least to provide some kind of overview of those options.
