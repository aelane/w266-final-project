I deleted the printer from System Preferences - Print & Scan by clicking on the minus sign. I tried restarting the printer, restarting the Mac, re-installing the driver, and cursing at the printer. Would the printer cause paper to curl? When this Samsung printer is up-and-running, it works like a dream, with great wireless printing, scanning, fax, and copying; however, the wireless set-up is a nightmare. My printer gets occasionally disconnected from my router, and, unlike my other devices, doesn't automatically connect when the network is up-and-running again, although I only have to turn off the WPA and redo it rather than hooking up everything again. During set-up, I couldn't get the printer to perform wirelessly, and customer support didn't seem to know the layout of their own machine. I am really admiring this printer! This is all in a modestly sized printer - it actually has a smaller footprint than theCanon PIXMA MP990 Wireless Inkjet Photo All-In-One Printerit replaced (but is a bit taller). This is the only printer I've ever dealt with where the wireless settings must be reset at practically EVERY use. When I go to print, the printer is disconnected from the wireless network and I have to use WPS to re-authorize the printer for my network. it adds the printer via the USB connection but doesn't tell you that you also need to add a wireless queue/selection for the Mac). For those uninitiated in printer set-up...well, you'd be hard-pressed to get this printer up and running unless you are lucky enough to have (and understand how to use) the WPS set-up on your wireless router. What this means is that you cannot print like an AirPrint enabled printer; you have to print THROUGH the Samsung app. I would give this printer 5 stars except it does not take advantage of Apple's Airprint technology (probably Apple's fault, not Samsung). I am not exaggerating when I say that this printer has caused my frustration meter to explode into yelps of rage. But I didn't select this printer for its wireless capabilities, and I simply use it plugged in with a USB cable. I do not recommend this printer unless you enjoy collapsing into fits of rage and despair.--UPDATE, Sept. 2013:  The paper doesn't jam anymore. Then it updated my printer's firmware and now I can't use 3rd party toner anymore! If you plan to put the printer near a physical network hub and don't need wifi in the printer, considerSamsung SCX-4729FDwhich only lacks wifi. There is no physical printer manual included but there is an html version on the CD and Samsung website. Overall, the printer is attractive and fairly quiet for a laser printer.Now some tips on driver installation. It is possible to do this from the printer keypad, but I recommend the cable if the computer is nearby. Finally, when searching for the printer during installation it wouldn't see it at first even after the printer was on the network - but I chose the next option "Set IP Address" which made it immediately appear. Once the printer is set up on the network, skip using the USB cable option for additional computers.If you want to scan or fax also, install the Scan Driver, which alone will allow you to scan from the computer using scan options from graphics programs and the like.

It's not necessary to use the printer, though, and the regular Samsung software is all I've needed to get the job done.If I never have to configure this printer for another network again it'll be too fracking soon, but now that it's working, I love this printer.

-- The printer ships with a 1000-page starter cartridge.

Unlike the comparable Brother printer (mentioned above), which requires replacement of both a printer cartridge and toner drum, this printer requires only a printer cartridge replacement.-- Like the quick setup guide, the machine and control panel overviews should be included in the box as hard copies.
