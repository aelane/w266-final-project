Then I took the corresponding dots off the plastic and stuck those on top of the dots on my dashboard. These little dots can hold a decent weight while still giving you the flexibility of being able to take the item off the way for whatever reason. These are basically velcro dots. They recommend 4 dots per one pound of weight for what you're trying to hang so they're not going to hang a heavy picture frame but they should come in handy for numerous small applications. 4 dots can hold a pound of weight, so with this set of 16 dots, you're good for 4 pounds. The small dots stick well enough for fashion use. They are black dots with permanent adhesive on one side and either hook or loop material on the other side (like Velcro). These are basically Velcro dots with sticky adhesive on the back.

These velcro dots do the job very well.

These fastener dots could be used for mounting items such as picture frames, on walls.The fasteners also grips and allow a release so if a person wanted to place their TV remote against the side of their TV or at the side of a TV table, it works and a person would always know where to look for the changer, or their spare glasses, if they wanted a place to have their glasses against a cabnet by the phone.I like it because it could also be used  outside the home so would be good for having some items fastened to the table when having an outdoor picnic.The use is to use four dots for each pound of weight.

Put two dots on the top of the remote's back and two elsewhere and there is a perfect hanging spot.
