These folders are such a good idea, one wonders why no one thought of this before. However the in between folders will not be flat; they will be squished against the front folder. The folders are a standard durability. These folders work well to divide categories within one folder instead of using multiple folders. I really like that each these folders contains three 1/3-cut tabbed sections. I find these folders incredibly handy for keeping handouts organized. These three folders make for easy selection among the different fillings:  one for each family member's taxes (blue for male and red for female) and an extra one for all those healthcare associated mailing we are receiving thanks to recent changes. Having folders with individuals dividers within the folder is a innovative and useful idea.I used my three folders (maroon, blue, and gray (?) The folders are have 1/3 cut tabs and are letter size. I haven't used these folders yet for a very long time, but I don't anticipate they will be useful over long periods. The folders will do the job I suppose. Instead of my notorious nesting folders within folders or having an accordion folder expand the sleek lines of my city/office shoulder bag, this organizer folder is great alternative.The Organizer Folder is pretty sturdy, easy to handle and likeable tools of office management and organizing stuff.When I sweep my inbox into my bag to "manage it" on the commute home, I have one organizer folder with the tabs ACT, READ, FILE. These Smead Organizer folders are brilliant. Basically, they are manilla file folders with three tabbed dividers built right in for a total of four sections.The back is the full height of the tabs and the front is cut low so the tabs are visible. The folders have actually 4 sections and 3 tabs, each section can expand to 3/4 inch as you put more papers into it. Instead of having four different folders you can put related materials into one of the Organizer Folders and not have to worry about juggling multiple folders. The folders are open on three sides and can be slipped into a filing system or carried on their own.The dull red, blue, and gray colors are inoffensive and suitable for office use, but not especially attractive.Joining the folders at the bottom was a clever idea, but I have strong reservations about how they will hold up when filled to the promised 3/4 inch expansion per section. These folders make a superb alternative.However, you do need to be cautious if you are filing non-standard-sized sheets of paper. The folders are stiff and if you try to put something thick in them, they rebel. Better to think of these as three folders in one - not as expandable files.And finally, there are two holes that run through all layers/dividers except the front.
