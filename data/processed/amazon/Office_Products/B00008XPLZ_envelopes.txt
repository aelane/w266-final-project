These envelopes were about 1/3 the price for the same thing at local office supply stores. They are good envelopes and I would have bought again but they were out of stock. They're envelopes. If you need envelopes they will work just fine. These are standard envelopes that work just as one would expect they should. These envelopes have worked out well. These envelopes fit the bill--good quality, great price, the glue works--what more can we ask of the poor envelope? Thes white envelopes.

These are really nice envelopes for the price.

These envelopes just came and I am not thrilled with them.

These envelopes only have glue about partway up the flap so I will have to use a lot of tape to get these shut securely.
