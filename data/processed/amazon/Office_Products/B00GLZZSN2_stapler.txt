This is not an upholstery stapler. I can now add their pneumatic stapler to the list of well-designed, solid tools. I tried out the stapler on numerous little side projects where I could test it out, and I have not been disappointed. The stapler is a nice tool -- good feel, seems solidly constructed and easy to hold/use. We broke open this stapler and were pleased it was ready to go with 2 sizes of staples so we did not have to wait for a trip to the store to get started!They dropped in easily, as stated on the description, and it sunk each staple so that it was flush with the wood we were stapling and none of the staples had a raised profile where the staples were placed.They went in effortlessly and smoothly, none jammed and we were finished in no time. I paid about $20.00 for a good mechanical stapler and a box of 3/8 inch staples. I use a stapler to mount paper and cardboard shooting targets out at my private shooting range and dragging a compressor there would be out of the question. I've had the same electric stapler for about 12 years.

The Surebonder stapler I have, that is very similar to this one, has that and performs better.

The Arrow stapler is a bit prettier (if you care about stapler appearance).

I haven't used either stapler on hard wood so I can't comment on driving power.
