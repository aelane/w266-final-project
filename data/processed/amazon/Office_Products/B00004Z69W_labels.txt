If you have MS WORD, you can just go to labels, select the #8660 and start typing away. Believe it or not, I use these labels for my home brew beer bottles. Kidding aside I love these clear labels and recommend them to those who wish to hide the background. Very handy, attractive labels. I love these clear labels; you can't even see them when they are affixed to an envelope or to anything else. These labels were easy to use. These labels are excellent -- 100% clear.PROS:--Sticky but easily removable--Labels are lightweight and thin--Labels look sleek/high qualityCONS:--Labels are a bit delicate--Price is highIf you are in need of clear labels, these are a great option! I wanted these labels for an alternate use. What's good and new:1) These labels are as close to being completely invisible as possible in a label. I've been using Avery labels for years, primarily to make my own return address labels and as someone that sends out a lot of SASE, it saves a lot of time. Avery's Easy Peel makes their address labels that much easier to use. I use Microsoft Word to print labels. These labels work well with my 5 year old HP inkjet printer and dry time is fast. The clear labels allow you to use non-white envelopes with a very professional look. I used these labels to make address labels for my save the dates. Well, we used these labels for our wedding invitations and RSVP cards. These exact labels are not like that, they are not truly transparent. Not only were they easy to print, the labels can be removed easily. The clear labels are wonderful for giving your envelopes the appearance of being stamped or printed on without the cost. These new labels have an "easy peel" design which makes it much easier and faster to peel off the sheet. Avery labels haven't let me down for all the years I've been using them. The labels are semi-transparent white on the sheet, but clear once adhered to the surface. Put the Avery labels over the printed test sheet, hold up to a strong light source, and see how it lines up.4. I use these labels to do marketing campaigns for my small landscaping business, and I was so impressed with how crisp and clean they look. These labels are made to be used on your printer with the Avery Template, and the results are spectacular! These VERSATILE, economical labels are a real find! These clear 1x2-5/8 labels are perfect for doing formal invitations - weddings, reunions, aniversaries, etc - any application where you have a premade invitation and an address database where the outer envelope is colored and would look like junk mail with a white mailing label attached.The clear label allows the post office to scan the address reliably (provided its not a halloween party invite with black envelopes - zero contrast there!) Seems we never have enough labels around here, between sending out invitations to one party or another or my new writer sending cards to family (I like to print out sheets of addresses she can easily put on an envelope by herself whens he has a letter ready to mail since she's only 6 and sometimes her writing can be a bit hard to read this way she can put one on and an envelope with a stamp and put it in the mail box herself, this has greatly increased her reading and writing by being penpals with all our out of state relatives). These labels are perfect for any or multi-colored designs you want for identification, addressing or application add-ons.Easy to use, just great and clear backing is good for any solid color page application. I would not buy these again due to worry over the labels falling off during shipping. I received these labels and the first thing I did was print out a page of address labels with my own information on them to test the quality. I reprinted the labels using standard ink quality and everything came out perfect. These labels match the quality and I could easily recommend using these for anything from mailing bills to mailing wedding invitations, they do a great job and the quality of the label is really good. The Avery Easy Peel 1 x 2 5/8 Inch Clear Address Label 750 Count (8660) are fabulous labels which have given me no problems. These clear labels are really and truly clear when applied, and they are extremely easy to remove from the sheet. Just tried out these labels on a mailing that I did. You can't go wrong with Avery labels. Printing on these labels is a snap. These labels worked out very well. I would reccomend these labels for any label uses. Unless I look real close, I can't tell if I printed the labels right or not. Great labels. I love using clear labels on things I like to look really nice. I really like Avery labels, as I've never had a problem setting them up to print properly. But these labels presented none of those challenges. I don't find that I crinkle the remaining labels on the page like others have commented on. The labels do the job that they were intended to do. I think these labels are a very good all purpose label, not just for an inkjet printer, as you can use these by hand too.Not only to label file folders,or to label cd cases, but I would also use these for just about anything I want to label, like when I buy something in bulk and freeze it. I have some labels just like this, but they are white. But if you want to use labels, the white rectangles look so ugly. Print your labels, fold along one of the lines, and the edges of ten of the labels are quickly exposed to make peeling super easy. These Avery INKJET labels worked just great in my older HP 7760 inkjet printer. There clear labels worked well for the invitations and didn't look at office like. We were able to peel the labels from the printed sheets easily. These clear, matte finish labels from Avery work great in my HP 1610 inkjet printer. These clear labels can be used for a variety of projects, particularly in the Arts & Craftscategory. About three out of 100 labels were messed up. I recommend these labels. I'm happy that we chose these labels for our Save the Dates. I always requested Avery labels at the office - they are extremely easy to print and apply. The Avery Easy Peel labels are really easy to work with. The labels are easy to peel off the sheet as well. I have also used these same labels in the white version, which work equally well. Those address labels are almost always illegible by the time they get to me. Avery always makes great labels and gives you the best templates and software to go with them, so it's no surprise that I'm very pleased with their clear easy-peel address labels. The clear labels impart a more professional appearance, and while I don't know it to be a fact, I think recipients are far more likely to pay attention.Finally, the easy peel feature prevents both frustration and inappropriate words in the office. Avery labels (the white paper ones) have been a staple at my desk and in my kitchen for years. I prefer the clear labels to others, as they give a neat effect on birthday card envelopes. I like these clear labels. I LOVE these labels. These labels are much, much better than the previous clear labels and simply work. The labels get darker every time you run them through the printer. Once printed, the labels are simple to remove and did not tear. These are a must have if you're wanting to put labels on colored envelopes or otherwise want a nicer finish than a colored or more visible label. I've used Avery labels for years including the laser version of 8660 until recently when my laser all-in-one bit the dust. I also just ran out of pre-printed labels of all sorts (including the freebees and the donate bait).The 8660 is a standard label in MS Word and Open Office, and that glable in UBUNTU supported them as well.W
