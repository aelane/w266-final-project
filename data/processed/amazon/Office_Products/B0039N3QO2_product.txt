This product turned out to not what I initially thought it would be. I think this product will find a niche over the long run. so, this product is perfect for someone like me. Great product and reusable which means they are a good investment. This product is a great idea. I highly recommend this product, even if you do not have an immediate need for it. I was very excited to get this product because I have a wall at work where I tape up photos of the kids. I got this product because I only allow my 5 year old to hang her school work, art, and etc on a limited real estate of cork screw board because I don't like using tacks on walls. But overall, I'd highly recommend this product if you want to hang something up but not commit to tack or tape that would ruin your painted walls. However, since this is a rather new product, I don't think any of us can really say anything about this claim from practice. Very versatile and useful re-usable mounting product. So, I recommend the product (quite frankly, I love them) but they are not a mounting solution for everything! I have also tried a similar product from 3M but it dried so hard that I took off some of the paint when taking it off. Overall, a solid product. This 3M product is so much easier to work with. (I would never consider using ANY product like this on wallpaper, so I hope no one is considering that option!) This is a nice product that is useful to put up pictures, posters, some papers and anything light-weight around the house or office. I can't believe it has taken this long to make a product like this that REALLY works. I used this product to mount photos and artwork and like the outcome. Just a good little product with enough "give" (they are sort of squishy) to use in lots of little places where you need a tiny bit of "filler" and a little "stick." Therefor, this product is another great addition to my quick household solution.These tabs holds 1/4 lb per square inch, and each tab is exactly 1 inch square. Thank you 3M for a really great product. This product was given a real-life try-out by a friend who has created a learning center in her kitchen for her seven-year old son. Nice product so far as I can tell! These Scotch Reusable Tabs are a new product, at least to me, and are a good idea for several reasons. In particular, my product came with a $1 off coupon adhered to the package which I intend to use ... again!These are particularly nice for places that magnets don't work, like SS appliances, and where tape or pins are a nuisance, like the walls of children's bedrooms. This is really a cool new product! I've used a product called Funtack some time ago. I think this is a pretty cool little product.
