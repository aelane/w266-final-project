This Dirt Devil Micro Shredr shreds paper into very tiny pieces which is amazing. Removed more paper shreds and it worked for a half a bin. You simply pull out the paper and just insert the opposite end and it completes the job. So far, I haven't had a hard paper jam that was as hard to remove on competing smaller paper shredding products. So when I first started tackling a copy paper box full of old files, this shredder seemed a little slow. So far, I have not had paper jam and have not used the reverse button, but it is available if you need it. I find myself pushing paper in and expecting something to happen and nothing does. While I primarily got it for paper, shredding expired credit cards or family records and photos held in CD/DVD format is part of the new reality and I'm glad to see it handles it well.5.

Also, you have to push the paper down rather deeply into the very narrow slot before it engages the shredder.

That's partly because it cross-cuts the paper into such tiny, tiny pieces that it compacts easily.

(It shreds it so finely that I used it to shred colored paper to fill cascarones!)
