This is a very capable label printer. Nicely done, and very convenient to use - no trying to bend the label to expose the backing. This is a good label maker, we haven't had any issues with it so far. I love this label maker. The label protective paper is a little tough to peel off from the label sticker.The label itself sticks securely to most surfaces. I was pretty excited to be getting this label maker when I found out I could print iron-on labels with it. The label isn't itchy or rough. I will never use another label maker and  will definitely recommend this one to my friends. The Epson label was 1.2" long, the LetraTag was 1.375 long, and the Dymo label was 1.625". We've all used label makers, or at least most of us have, so I don't feel the need to go into the basics. The Epson LabelWorks label printer is a compact and convenient label printer that lets you print professional looking tags and labels in just a few minutes. This is a great little label printer. Other than that however this is a good label printer and while I haven't found and real practical use for it at home yet, it comes in handy at work when labeling our gaming machines to make it easier to find out which wire at the Network switch goes to which machine.This is an very well designed label printer and I would recommend anyone looking to purchase one to take a look at this one. I haven't used a label maker since the old Dymo Label days. But fairly or not, I expected a better-looking label to come out of this.I've rated this product four stars, which is a compromise position: five stars for the product's usability, and three for the labels themselves. The Epson LabelWorks LW-300 Label Printer is a good basic label maker. This label maker is very easy to use. This may sound trivial, but with my Brother P-Touch label maker, I always had to cut off the blank pieces on each end of my label. But if you need to change the label configurations often, the simplistic interface may be a deal breaker. I've been very happy with the Brother label printers I own, and this is the first Epson label printer I've tried. THis is a neat little label maker. I've owned other label makers before, but never have I had one that is this versatile and well-designed! Setting up and using the label maker for the first time was a snap! They just make the label maker complete in that you can use it in almost every aspect of organizing. There is also a glow-in-the-dark label tape - how cool is that? In general, this is a very nice, mostly simple to use label maker.Without reading instruction, you can turn it on and make a label.If you want to do anything else, it gets more complicated and sometimes very complicated. You remember those old label makers with the dial on top and you'd spin it to the letter you want and punch a letter into the thick, unsightly tape. Well, this isn't that label maker. Being able to quickly change the label tape color allows me to add color coding to my filing system. I've used some label makers where I had to dig through menus to get to what I considered common symbols (double quotes, braces, etc.). I really wasn't interested in a complicated label maker, and Epson did a great job of creating a good label maker that is easy to use but also has a ton of advanced features for those people who want them. The label print quick and are sharp and clear. The label cartridges are very easy to change out, and I was able to test all kinds of different labels with it. The Epson LW300 is a great label printer at an affordable price. There are many different label cartridges you can buy - each includes the labels and ink in a self-contained unit. It comes with one label cartridge- the white plastic tape. The label tape can easily be removed for repositioning and then reapplied. I had to look up how to delete label names and how to do all in upper case.The one tricky part came when I went to remove the backing. I wanted a versatile label maker to use in every area of our house, from the laundry room to the garage. The Epson LabelWorks LW-300 Label Printer is the easiest to set up and operate and the most versatile label maker I've ever used. This label is just incredible.The size, the options on different labels.They included the batteries, 7 different labels: black on white, white on black, plead design blue, plead design pink, night glow, etc.It prints very fast and clear.Double line when font size is not too big.It is just wonderful.The label sticks just right to any space.I use them to print labels for cables behind network equipment, kitchen bottles, just about anything you can think of.It is also reasonably priced.The cutter works fine too. Ok, I will admit that I have not used a label maker in YEARS. These make the label maker extremely multi-functional. What I appreciate most about the Epson LabelWorks label maker is its easy to understand format. The label maker has several fonts to choose from and it is simple to switch back and forth between fonts. My old label maker left at least 1/2" on either side, so this is definitely an improvement.My next investment might be a power cord, but honestly, if the batteries continue to last as long as these seem to be, I don't think I'll actually need it.Very happy with this! Excellent label maker. A great label maker, very versatile, highly recommended. You can do so much with this label maker. The Epson LabelWorks LW-300 label printer is very easy to use and set up. I haven't used a label maker in years. This was the first label maker that I got for personal use. I love the black label with the gold print. I have three different label makers. I had been using aCasio KL-780 EZ Label Printerand I had to go over each label with tape in order to get them to stick and stay. I did a nice label for school with a border and stuck it on his cup, and it hasn't come off, not even when I washed it (by hand, not sure how it would hold up in the dishwasher, but it feels like it would still stay attached).CONS... only because I should list a couple things, not that they are big issues:- AAA batteries... I have to iron directly over the label for about 15 seconds and it sticks like glue. The Epson LabelWorks LW-300 Label Printer is a very nice label printer.Takes 6 AAA batteries (I received them in my box but I dont think they normally come with the batteries)You can make all sorts of labels and tags.The label it comes with automatically is white with black lettering.There is several options on this- which I was surprised to see.There is 89 different frames you can choose from or no frame at all, there is a heart frame, stars, sports, holiday, and many others!You can change the fonts.You can change how long you want the label to be, write mirrored, horizontally, very neat!There is a lot of symbols you can choosefrom as well, such as numerous Prohibition symbols, Food, household, sports, activity (plane,music,etc), holiday symbols (Christmas,Wedding,Bday,Baby,Love,Flag,Halloween,& more), shipping symbols, animals,zodiac,emoticons, office, safety, and so many more!There is detailed directions for using the  printer, it is easy to figure out, after checking out the instructions.I was lucky enough to also try other cartridges for the printer...Clear with black ink!Glow in the dark with black ink!Black with gold ink!Blue and white plaid with grey ink!Blue with black ink that is Iron On!Pink with black ink that is Iron On!All of them are very cool!Very easy to change the cartridges!Especially the iron on labels- PERFECT for labeling clothing, jackets, backpacks, etc for school or daycare!The only thing that I would prefer to be different would be the size, it is about 5 1/2 inches by 5 1/2inches, 1 1/2 inches thick, its kind of bulkybut it does a lot.Labels could be sticker as well!I still say 5/5 stars!I just noticed the price $39.99I am very surprised at the price, it is a lot lower than I expected for this!Great deal! This little label maker from Epson is Easy to set up, and easy to use. Gripe #2: When previewing your label, sadly your fonts and styles aren't applied on the screen so you have no what-you-see-is-what-you-get preview. A label maker was the perfect solution. I browsed the many many label makers available on Amazon.com (boy there are a lot). )I was able to print a label without reading the instructions, but was more comfortable operating the printer after reading through them. I've used P-Touch label makers in the past, and I like those very much. I never expected a label maker in this price range could deliver so many features. For some of us out there, you know who you are (hint if you're reading this, I'm talking about you), label makers are a bit of a guilty pleasure. This label maker adds a bit to the fun side of the equation, plus the results are generally great. The LW-300 is a powerful, easy-to-use label printer. Too many label printers are impossible to figure out without the manual in one hand, and the more features they have, the harder they are to use. Unlike other label printers I've used, it doesn't print extra inches of wasted tape around each label. I see it's actually called a label printer and that would be more appropriate because it's definitely nothing like the old label makers where you turn a dial and punch each letter you want. This is a great label maker for your basic to intermediate label making needs. As far as label makers go, the LabelWorks LW-300 is nice. We tried changing the label cartridge and the batteries, but we still got the same error message. The label maker worked fine for another day, and then the same message appeared "motor error".
