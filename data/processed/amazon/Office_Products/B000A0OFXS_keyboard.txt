You can tilt the keyboard stand either way; a negative tilt is supposed to be better so I tried that. It helps support my keyboard to make it easier to type and the gel wrist rest is soft and really helps my hands as I type. I have a logitech keyboard and if you've had one you know how flat they are and same with most other keyboards these days, I'm use to the keyboards that are more like typewriter keyboards and not like the flat notebook keyboards that tend to be the trend now. If it seems like you're on your keyboard 24/7, you'll like the relief this 3M gel wrist platform offers. Because I'm on my keyboard so much, I'm a prime time candidate for carpal tunnel syndrome. Every single keyboard I've ever used, except for Kinesis Contour keyboards, had positive tilt feet/legs. I already had a keyboard pad when I received this tilt adjustable keyboard pad. My keyboard already has a tilt that I like, so I am using this in the flat mode. The keyboard wrist pad has a sticky underside and it sticks to the plastic plate instead of my desk. But my keyboard has a keypad on the right side of my keyboard that makes it wider than say a laptop keyboard. And this works better for me because my keyboard is also thin. I like my keyboard offset a bit (see posted image) to the right and there was plenty of room to set things up the way I like. I have a tilted keyboard (I use the wireless Logitech gaming keyboard) and thought it was pretty comfortable as it was. After working with my keyboard and using the 3M Tilt Gel Rest Platform, I realized that this was something I needed but didn't know I needed it. My keyboard fits on it nicely.Overall, this is a nice product. There are probably other adjustable keyboard platforms out there for a lower price, but you may not get such a nice wrist wrest to go along with it. I've been using this keyboard platform for several months and it does the job quite well for me. This keyboard rest platform is a solid, very hard surface on the bottom, and a wrist rest that is a bit more firm than I like: it's a gel wrist pad, but the one I have is much squishier and more comfortable. This will hold it steady and also give the keyboard a comfortable angle which is easy on your wrists. Plus, the keyboard always migrates and I have to put it back into place.I really like this product. The keyboard won't move around, the wrist won't move around, and you won't have to keep adjusting your keyboard all the time. This is a "serious" keyboard platform. It will probably last forever, certainly longer than your keyboard.

This is a reasonably comfortable keyboard rest with a gel pad for the wrist.

If you prefer an ergonomic keyboard (which I do) it doesn't fit properly in this.

It has been frustrating to have on my keyboard.
