I love them.And they come in different colors. The colors in this pack are a nice, bright pink, a yellow with more oomph than the usual Post-It yellow, eye-catching lime green, and a cool Mad Blue. The colors are vibrant to make discrimination easy (as opposed to those Avery labels where you can't tell red from orange). The colors are almost too bright for me. The bright colors made it easy to see the label and the temporaryness meant that I could remove them once I had been moved in. Bright colors, perhaps a little too neon for some, but you'll definitely see them on whatever you label. With the four included colors, you can also come up with a color-coding scheme, for example, yellow for financial, blue for work-related stuff, pink for family-related matters, green for everything-else. I like the colors because they stand out (use a larger font) and I like the fact that they are sized for a Word template so that I can make nicer looking, more attention grabbing labels in hopes that family members will pay attention to them when putting something on a shelf.Recommended. The colors were bright which is great and I like the idea I can run them through my computer or hand write on them. Very bright colors, high quality. The colors are at least different from the usual plus they are fairly bright so they will stand out. The colors are bold so they stand out to ensure your eyes point directly at them when trying to find the print you need. I really like that you get 4 colors in one pack.I'm very happy with the 3M labels, which stick really well in the cold, even on non-porous surfaces. The colors are bright and fun and make it super easy to categorize things. The colors are bright, but not eye-piercingly so, and even pencil marks don't smear on them. Nice colors and sizes, too. The colors are bright and can have a variety of uses. While the bright colors help items stand out, they don't make quality postal mailing labels. I can easily apply different colors to different loads so I can tell at a glance what is in the box. The colors are rather neon, so make sure that is OK by you. I have to be honest though, I don't particularly like any of the colors. I would've preferred normal primary colors or even pastels for a more professional look.The dimensions (1" x 2 5/8") are exactly the same as the Avery 5160 address labels so Microsoft Word and other apps/templates will easily work with them. Nice bright colors - they stick to things well but remove easily with no gunk left behind, and no damage to the label when removed. BUT they are easily removable, too.I LOVE the colors - very bright and vibrant just like some of the cooler post-it notes - magenta, blue bird, lime and bright yellow - very nice and easy to use. The colors, four in the package, are bright, but translucent, so you can see what's behind them.I'm switching to these labels for all my organizing, and will be so proud to have labels I don't have to peer at or lose! The colors are bright and cheery and the labels work well--it's POST IT so you get what you expect--greatness! So, prepare yourself for the very vibrant colors that will assault your eyes when you open the package! Besides the easy to see neon colors, these labels go anywhere and on anything without leaving a sticky residue when removed.They can be put on plastic bins, paper folders, even wood. I like the colors: yellow, lime green, bold pink, and aqua blue. They work as intended and the bright colors are easy to color code your videos, books, bins, or whatever you need. The colors make them great and fun for labeling things around the house. If they were primary colors and not neon I'd use them as gift tags on my Christmas presents. Or those who like vaguely neonish colors in general.Or you could cover your spouse in these as she sleeps and when she wakes she'll think it's 1985.They are plenty sticky, don't leave much goo, and do what they should; unless you need the colors, however, you'd get a lot more value buying the white ones, which offer far more labels for the same price. The colors are great for reading black text. Not only that, but they have colors!!! They stick well, and they are easy to write on.The colors are bright and not hideous. First off, I love the great, bright colors that these labels come in. The colors are vivid BLUE, GREEN, PINK & YELLOW. The colors are eye-catching, and the package comes with 3 sheets of blue (my fave) and 4 sheets each of pink, yellow, and green (or Limeade). The colors, althoug a bit too bright for my taste, help with sorting out the parts when needed. I have always loved the Post It's in bright colors. Plus the colors really make them stand out. I definitely plan on purchasing them again when I need alternate colors. These are the best colors to use for making anything stand out. Their bright colors will help you to quickly identify or locate any item. I'd like to see them made in primary colors too, in addition to neon. Great vibrant colors will really stand out for color coding purposes. The colors are pleasant enough for around the house use.Do be careful about getting these mixed up with regular non-removable labels, as these would not be appropriate for some of those uses, such as mailing and postage.Great to see these on the market... Also, these come in nice bright colors -- blue, pink, yellow, and lime that successfully allow color coding of files.Additionally, they are easy to use on a printer (both laser and inkjet), or with a regular old inkpen. They also come in multiple colors per package, so you don't have to over-buy to get color coding.the one minor criticism i have of this technology is that if you use partial sheets with a laser printer, the unused labels seem to weaken in their attachment to the backing paper sheet. The colors look good and the labels printed nicely.This is something I'm going to use a lot from now on. They come in 4 colors in the package of 450. Bright colors and easy labeling that doesn't fall off. I'd limit these bold colors to things that need to be easy to find at all times.Incidentally, if you are a small business and making promotional material, a sparing use of bright sticker like this might help getting attention. Vibrant colors. The colors are good for color coding, though the "neon" is the muted colors I see in the traditional highlighter four-color packs, pink, yellow, green, blue. The brilliant colors -- green, pink, yellow, blue -- are a godsend for me. Third, the colors alone will entice the kids into using these for school and organizing their stuff.We used these for a bunch of CD's that we had laying around...with content and no markings. The colors of these tabs are so lovely that I will steal them from my library's office and use them for my pre-K artclass. The colors are wonderfully vibrant and make it much easier for me to sort my vials into categories, something I could not do previously. You get four different colors in a pack which is handy for organizing or color-coding. The colors are very, very bright with the blue being the most toned down of the set.T
