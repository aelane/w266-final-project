As you might expect, this wrist rest is very light because it is made of foam. I had been using a gel wrist wrest but my son keeps playing with them and sooner or later (the last one actually lasted quite a long time) the outer edges start peeling... It did provide good wrist support, while I went without one it was a noticeable difference. This wrist rest comes in handy for writing research papers and the dreaded college application essays.Antimicrobial sounds great and all, but the foam part on top can get slightly dirty by gathering dust and other things. This wrist rest is relatively small compared to others I've used. It bends on it's own when you hold it up and for a wrist rest it is feather-weight. Before I discovered wrist rests and then the ergo keyboard, my wrists would hurt after typing all day. This is a foam wrist rest, not a gel wrist rest. The wrist rest is the perfect length for my HP standard keyboard, but I did find this long for use with my Apple wireless keyboard.

Seeing this 3M foam wrist rest on Amazon Vine, I thought why not give it a try. Well, I can agree that this is a comfortable wrist rest, and I don't even detect any strong smell unless I stick my nose to the wrist rest's surface. However, I find this foam wrist rest to be inferior to my gel wrist rest on one important count: cleanliness. With the gel wrist rest, all I need is to wipe it with a damp cloth, and the non-permeable surface is clean as new. But this form wrist rest has a cloth surface, which is permeable. This wrist rest attracts lint and other small dirt like magnet, and thanks to its black color, the dirt is very visible. Its a nice wrist rest, which was what I was looking for, and definitly helps cut down on the carpal tunnel, so that does the trick for sure! This wrist rest is very comfortable and the perfect size for both my keyboard and my wrists. I don't really notice wrist strain while on the computer, but I figured maybe it's just a little more comfortable. Very comfortable wrist rest. I was excited to try this wrist rest after a few weeks of pain in my wrists. The foam wrist rest is great on my wrist. When I first started using my wrist rest, I kept pressing the wrong keys on the board. I use this wrist rest (that's a tongue twister!)
