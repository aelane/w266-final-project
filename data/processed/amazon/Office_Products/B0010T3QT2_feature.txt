Still, it is this reveal-a-peeking-snitch feature that makes this envelope a sensation and nowhere on the box does it tell a customer that it does this. The primary feature that distinguishes this product is that these envelopes are tamper-proof so that you know the envelope was not opened since it was initially sealed. The self-seal feature is unique, at least to me, as there is no strip to peel off. These envelopes feature a couple of (moderately) innovative enhancements. It's novel to me as I haven't seen this feature before.Overall, I think these are good envelopes for the Reveal-N-Seal feature alone, but I would be very cautious if I have to pay extra over regular envelopes to get the safety features. It is a nice feature not having to lick the envelope to seal it. It looks as if this feature needs work. My favorite feature is the self-sealing flap. I do like the Reveal-N-Seal feature. The feature I like best though is the adhesive, instead of having to pull a strip off which you then have to toss in the garbage, these have a self-adhesive flap to fold up and fold down and you're sealed. There is an added feature that reveals the word "opened" if someone tries to open it up without your permission.
