The plastic cover that wraps around the binder is very loose, particularly on the back side.In fact, this is the loosest plastic covering I have ever seen on a binder, to the point where a piece of paper tucked inside (between the white notebook and the clear plastic backing) might easily fall out of the back if turned upside down. This also works will with clear plastic three hole sheets as a photo album. However the plastic overlay was attached in such a manner that it is obviously doesn't fit giving it a cheap and amateurish look. The plastic sleeves seem a bit flimsy, not likely to be too durable if your notebook gets rough treatment or heavy use. It is white plastic covered with a clear plastic covering (into which you can insert a title page or decorative art to personalize the generic binder). This clear plastic extends inside to give you two slots to use as interior folders. I will say that the white plastic binder may seem a bit sturdier (not to a whole different degree, though) and the covering is better adhered to the product. I'm not sure when or how this happened, but it did let me see that the plastic cover is not thick or strong at all. Has a clear plastic insert space on the front and back cover, as well as the spine. Even less helpful are the cheap interior plastic pockets, one of which was ripped off even before I got it.This is a dirt cheap binder, and it looks and feels it. The clear plastic continues on the inside creating sleeves on the inside front and inside back to hold more information or notes.This binder is great for organization of large projects. It does thave two clear plastic slots for shoving in some papers at the front and back.
