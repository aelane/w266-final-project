This file sorter is excellent for bills and things that only need to sit on you desk for a while, like bills or invoices, before getting filed away. I have a Bulletin Board file in my file cabinet and this folder is perfect for me to file alphabetically the papers for  the different &#34;boards&#34; that I put up. This file sorter I use for my IMPORTANT paperwork. This could fit in a file cabinet, in a folder .... that might be one of the best uses for it. Since the file is larger than the letter size sheets of paper I need to file, this works quite well. The file is expandable and opens like a book. This file sorter is handy for my office desktop. It is a file sorter kind of like having a bunch of letter size manila box bottom folders attached at the bottom. However, it works great in the portable file box I use. Nice file system but papers fall out too easily. This file sorter allows you to separate everything right when you get it. This file organizer is heavily made and adaptable for many individual uses. You can't toss this file around and expect your things to stay inside, but with normal handling it should actually serve you pretty well. The file itself is surprisingly expandable, and the dividers are alphabetically labeled. Each file expands to an inch or more at the bottom. I use the file for student grade sheets. The file stays on my desk, so I don't worry about the contents spilling out of the sides, but that might be an issue for others.
