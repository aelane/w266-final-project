I've used Prismacolor pencils for 10+ years and they are still the best colored pencils I've ever used so they are in fact worth every penny. After using these pencils for a while I soon found that I wanted to expand my horizons and I invested in the 120 pencil set. Of the colored pencils I've used over the years, these are the best I've found.Prismacolor Premier colored pencils have a soft lead, so soft that you need to tread lightly as you apply them, or the lead is easily broken. You will enjoy these pencils as long as you realize that you can't power them onto the paper, and that the lead will wear down quickly because they are so soft. I could never get it to look any better then poor, these pencils stepped up my little bits to the point I don't have to be ashamed for people to see my little doodles. I use the pencils up quickly, so having two sets is not a waste at all. These are by far the best colored pencils I have bought and totally worth the price and they don't smudge I will not buy any other colored pencil again but this brand These are nice pencils. 48 pencils fit nicely in my art bag. I got blending pencils, and the appropriate paper - plus some fixatif from Prismacolor. I might just learn to draw with colored pencils and do some masterpieces. These pencils are more suited for use by artists & aren't necessary for average use.I am totally impressed that these pencils can be used to draw marbles that look transparent like the ones on the cover of this bookMasterful Color: Vibrant Colored Pencil Paintings Layer by Layer.By the way, all you artists probably know this, but in case you don't know...these pencils need to be sharpened before you use them. These pencils are just the right size for my hands, and the soft core leads produce beautiful colors and layers of colors on paper. The pencils did not disappoint.
