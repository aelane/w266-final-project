There is a color LCD panel so you can see what will print when you are printing out photos. The color quality and sharpness are great...Epson photo printouts are among the best. Making color or black and white copies of documents is easy. the color prints are beautiful! It has the individual color ink cartridges that I think is important because ink isn't cheap. The color is bright and the images clear.UPDATEWe still love this printer. The shiny sleek black color is awesome as well.The set up for this Epson was a total breeze! The color of the black from a scan after being printed is fine, lighter than a regular printed copy. Scanning a color photo was just as quick but a little longer to print. But the color was good. *  The color is pretty good compared to other inkjets I've used. And if you run out of color, the printer asks you to continue in B&W. It is a color ink jet printer that holds about 30 pieces of paper, but it is built to perform.It prints 8.7 black and white or 4.5 color pages per minute.
