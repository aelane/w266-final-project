I've been wanting a chalkboard for quite some time now, to teach my daughter how to write. This chalkboard is the perfect size for small spaces! :)I would definitely recommend this chalkboard for others to use for pictures, for writing practice, and for those living in small spaces! The 14 x 14 chalkboard is the perfect size for a menu and looks nice on my wall. So decided to try this black chalkboard with some wonderful bright color chalks I just got.I love the effect of the bright colors on the black board. I like the chalkboard and I have had no problems with it. This chalkboard is lighter than a slate board, because it's, well, not slate. Awesome chalkboard!It took me all of 5 minutes to hang. We like this chalkboard. This is a great little chalkboard. This is a nice little chalkboard, &#34;little&#34; being the operative word here. This is a handy little chalkboard that looks pretty good on the wall. This chalkboard is nicely made. This is really a lovely little chalkboard. This is the perfect small chalkboard (the size of a standard letter) for leaving brief messages in the kitchen. This chalkboard looks great, and the price is right, but there are a few things that should be noted. The Quartet Chalkboard is a neat little chalkboard you can hang on a wall or attach to your refrigerator with the included magnets.The wood frame makes this chalkboard much more attractive than the typical cheap chalkboards with plastic frames. Communicating by chalkboard is not the latest and greatest technology - but it works! It is a nice small chalkboard which, of course, can be rewritten over and over again.Because of its elegant appearance, it is something which may be used in a very nice setting without looking out of place. It seems like I will have to refresh it with chalkboard paint, which is not worth the effort since I can turn something I like into a chalkboard (e.g., a picture frame) and not have to deal something I find unattractive. It LOOKS like chalkboard, so I'm sure that if you got those fancy chalkboard pens it would suffice wonderfully. This Quartet Chalkboard is a nice chalkboard to hang in your kitchen, bedroom, or to have kids use for drawing. But overall, if you are looking for a nice but affordable chalkboard for anything, I would recommend this one. This is a very classy-looking chalkboard, and at 14x14 it's a great size to display the day's specials at a restaurant, or to display announcements at a message center. If you're looking for an inexpensive chalkboard, this will meet your expectations. Otherwise, it is a cute little chalkboard and will make a good addition to your home organization. This is a nice little chalkboard. As a chalkboard, though, you can write on it. This is a very nicely framed chalkboard. Great little kitchen chalkboard to put my kids chores on! To be honest, that just isn't as much chalkboard as I thought it would be. After using the chalkboard I found that after a few uses this board looks dirty and smudged and it is not as smooth as a traditional chalkboard surface. The Quartet Chalboard is a small chalkboard that looks nice in my decor. This little chalkboard (the exact size of a standard piece of printer paper) has become a fun addition to our home, especially for our kids. I have been using this nice looking chalkboard for the past four weeks and I love writing in the old fashioned way. This chalkboard is really pretty nice-looking! This is a standard small chalkboard with a faux wood frame.Due to the frame the actual usable chalkboard space is 6 inches by 8.5 inches.Comes with 3M stickers and magnets so you can either attach it to the wall or use magnets to make it removable.Works like a standard chalkboard so it's just average. Really sweet little chalkboard. I have wanted a chalkboard to write my daily notes, meal planning and such for my 1950's Inspired Kitchen (think Steak N' Shake decor).This is not made of genuine slate but a simulated product that is super lightweight. This chalkboard makes a great photo prop! ), but was relieved when the chalkboard arrived to find that it is a clear sticker, easily removed with no residue left on the frame!My only complaint is that the writing surface itself is not real slate, and I don't think chalk writes quite as smoothly on whatever the material this board is made of (feels kinda like countertop laminate).Overall the size and price of this chalkboard make for an affordable prop! While this chalkboard is cute and looks nice, it is far to small of a writing surface to be of any practical use. I'm not sure how much you can critique a small chalkboard that sells for only $6. This chalkboard looks nice hanging in our kitchen, but it is a lot of frame and the writing surface is only about 6&#34; x 8&#34; - not really enough to make lists and such when writing with chalk.
