it's nice to have a wireless printer after setting it up. Google Cloud Drive (and normal wireless printing, as well)If you don't know what Google Cloud Print is, I'm not going to explain it here (look it up) other than to say this: I have a Linux laptop and my laptop was unable to successfully use the printer to print a document. AirPrint Compatible' is a fantastic wireless printer that gets the job done well. I like the wireless printing from my laptop and automatic double-sided printing and so for that it is a nice addition to my home office. I have this set up using the wireless option, the printing is fast and reliable, and I like the double-sided feature. The wireless  works very well, and remote printing from a pad or phone works flawlessly. It was super easy to set up with wireless network and phoneline for fax. The wireless aspect was easy to set up.

Set up the wireless, and went to add it to my Mac.

I just used the built-in wireless to add this printer to my home network.

I never gave though to the "wireless" aspect as being nothing more than one less cable to deal with ... until I downloaded the free Epson iPad app and started printing docs from my iPad immediately.
