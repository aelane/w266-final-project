They are the lightest of the pouches that Fellowes manufactures and are recommended for notices and photos. I have tried the 5mil pouches but found them to unnecessarily thick and stiff for most of my purposes. I have also used pouches made by Scotch and 3M, but continue to return to the Fellowes products. What I CAN say is that these pouches are reliable, apply cleanly and evenly and after using many of them, I am pleased to report that I have yet to throw away a single one that has become 'creased' in the laminating process.These are, for my purposes, the right brand and the right thickness for most imaginable routine laminating needs. All the pouches I have used have been Fellowes brand, and I have had great luck with all. The smaller pouches worked great with 3x5 cards I used and the regular letter sized worked fine. Some of the pouches have sharp corners, so I always have good scissors to round the ends off with. You can tell looking at the pouches if you're going to be cutting them past the point where they'll be waterproof; that is very helpful. These pouches are first-class! I have aScotch Thermal Laminator 2 Roller System (TL901)and was hoping the Fellowes pouches would work well in my machine. I did find the pouches to have a bit of static, which made it a little difficult to position the paper inside. These pouches are perfect for small laminating projects at home!The 3 mil. pouches are quite a bit thicker and are awesome for things that you want to be more sturdy. After using laminating pouches for years, I wouldn't consider myself an expert on the item, but I am expert on what suits my needs and what is acceptable to me. These pouches did not work as well as expected, in fact they were a huge disappointment. I generally use Scotch and Universal pouches and these Fellowes pouches were far inferior, actually ruining some of the laminated photos and pages. These pouches laminate very nicely. The pouches remained absolutely clear so the print appears vivid and easy to read.I would be pleased to use these again and would have no hesitation in recommending their quality to others. I like that the pouches have a curved edge and are not perfectly square as I have children who can turn the most innocent of items into a eye poking dagger. The pouches work with other brands of laminators so these may be an economical alternative. Fellowes pouches sealed nicely without bubbles. When utilizing the pouches, I used aScotch Thermal Laminator 2 Roller System (TL901)as the lamination source. These laminating pouches are fantabulous. The pouches are clear. It works, don't get me wrong, but smaller pouches is just more ideal. The pouches are available in 3 mil, 5 mil, 7 mil, and 10 mil thickness.The 3 mil pouches are thin but not the thinnest. The thinnest pouches I've seen are 1.5 mil. For a hundred pouches, the going  price on Amazon is quite reasonable. The Fellowes pouches did do a good job sealing on a single pass through a budget laminator. These pouches work well and the fact that they are a letter size is a definite plus. The pouches are also offered in 7 mil and 10 mil, but with more of a jump in price. I tested these Fellowes pouches next to 2 others I still had on my shelf - Scotch's (Scotch Thermal Pouches 8.9 x 11.4 Inches, 100-Pack (TP3854-100)) and these 'no name' ones (3 Mil Clear Letter Size Thermal Laminating Pouches 9 X 11.5 Qty 100 (UNV84622)).I have no complaints with these Fellowes Laminating Pouches; in fact, after several tests with all 3 pouches, I could not tell a difference between Fellowes or the other two kinds. These laminating pouches are of good quality, are very clear, and they do the job.A
