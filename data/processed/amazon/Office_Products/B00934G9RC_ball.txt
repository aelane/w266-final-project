I've never used a ball as a chair and got this product mostly because it seemed like an odd idea and I was curious. If you are wondering about purchasing one, its exactly what it looks like - a ball chair that won't roll around while you sit on it.Two problems I have with this chair:First, not as usable as I wanted it to be. Inflating the ball, however, will take you a long time with the included hand pump and I don't recommend that you use it. The ball is very comfortable and the mesh fabric of the covering is breathable and soft. You must insert the deflated ball into the hole of the seat, and use the pump to inflate it "till its smooth" dont overpump. You can move the ball around, without rolling to the side and braining yourself on the edge of your desk. It is not heavy and can be picked up and carried easily.Assembly:You must insert the deflated ball into the hole in the bottom and pump it up with the cheap pump they supply to you. The ball is stated to be "anti-burst", so it can be inflated to any degree of firmness. We have three other ball seats in our house, they are all loose to roll around, never have popped one yet and they get daily use. We like it, if it popped you could just put a new ball inside. I don't use the ball for all-day sitting in an office setting, instead I swap out the Zenergy Ball Chair for my office chair a few times a day for about an hour. The ball inside the woven cover is burst-proof, which is, in my opinion, a must-have quality in an exercise ball. I inserted the ball as per the directions and pumped it up using the provided hand-powered pump. The ball is covered with a red, mesh type fabric that is more attractive in person than in the Amazon image in my opinion. I have used a ball at my desk at work and the Safco Products Zenergy Ball Chair is way more attractive. Pumping up the ball with the hand pump provided was a workout, and I am not in bad shape. I got this ball because I used to love those 'kneeling' chairs, where you're forced to sit up straight with support for your knees and your bottom. The ball is supposed to be puncture proof, and hopefully that is correct, because we do have cats with claws. Once the ball is inflated and the plug put in place, you screw the legs on and you are done.I find it comfortable for my home office. I was curious to see if this was would be more "comfortable" since it's more stable than just having the ball alone.First off let me say that this was very easy to put together. You can always re-inflate the ball if it gets a little bit too flat. The ball might be a little undersized for some bigger people. The ball, though, is really ugly and air seems to seep out of it, even though it is an expensive exercise ball. The ball also seems to be durable and able to accommodate even a very large person. You stick the deflated ball into the cover and pump it up and then screw in the four legs to the base to turn this into a chair (easy peasy lemon squeezy).
