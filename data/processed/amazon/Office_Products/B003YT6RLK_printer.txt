This is a good printer. This is my third HP printer and I have to say that each improves on the prior printer. All three continue to work wonderfully and I do not think I would buy a printer from another company. The printer prints quickly and clearly. I am very happy with the printer. Setting up any printer for Windows is tedious. I am using this printer on a Mac with added Windows OS so it must print from both OS. This is a fantastic printer, although the document feed is known for jamming everything else is fantastic and works perfectly.A++ I really like the printer. It is extremely difficult to get inside the printer to remove the jammed paper.

When I set up my printer for the first time, nothing I could do would make the sheet feeder, feed.

Also, this printer jams more often than any other printer I've ever owned, mostly from the internal tray.

I've never had a printer that didn't snug up the paper stack.
