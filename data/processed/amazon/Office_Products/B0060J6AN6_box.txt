If you store the box for a long time in a dusty area, stuff newspaper or tissue into the handle holes to keep out the dust. And then, I realized that the box wasn't quite fitting the way I wanted -even after following the instructions three times, and doing all the folds necessary-- as the pieces were a little too cramped, causing the internal parts of the box to warp a bit. If you look at the box sideways you can see inside without taking off the lid.CONS:-- HARDER TO PUT TOGETHER THAN USUAL. I know this box was designed to fit into furniture with "cubby holes", but I still wish the boxes were a bit larger to at least fit stacks of 8.5 x 11 papers. I have found this box to be very valuable for the storage of my linens - durable, easy to assemble, and with the added bonus of the 'see through' section. The box walls are double thickness cardboard and the box holds its shape well. This makes it so that when pulling the box off the shelf, the grip is smoother than grabbing the ragged edge of cardboard. to get into the box easily however.Outside of that, they are the typical storage box you assemble yourself. They might be nice if you won't ever move or use the box, but then why bother?They are said to fit most cubby systems and their sides are sturdy. They can be used as a single box placed on the living room floor or under the coffee table for pet toys (what I wanted them for) or to put on storage shelves to store items that are easy to retrieve but that you don't want to display. (Please be aware that this box is not designed to hold wet items.) One box I decided to put a few books in but that was actually too heavy and the corner started to rip. A box is a box, and this box is okay. I get it; the box handle is designed to help you pull it off a shelf. The box was easy to put together - just popped everything in and it's shaped up, and the handles were easily popped on.

You know how you assemble the box by folding up the sides and then folding the upper half of each side back down into the box?

The assembled box is sturdy - the plastic handles at the end not only make it easy to hold the box but they help hold the ends together.The box has an attractive black and white print, though the idea is that you won't be looking at it all the time.
