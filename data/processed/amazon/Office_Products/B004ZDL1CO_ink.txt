The other is that the ink color is noted only with a small circle near the clicker. Balanced and comfortable to hold, the ink doesn't smear or smudge (even for a lefty! The ink for me didn't leave any smears or blots as others have had problems with. The ink is smooth and dark. It is not too thick and the ink dries immediately. It starts smooth and continues with solid ink, even writing very quickly. I checked and the ink IS waterproof.I gave them only 4 stars since they are not "revolutionary" as claimed, and that they have a tendency to smudge. The ink flows very nicely from the tip and transfers very well to the paper.The ink does not glob. The ink also has a tendency to form globs which have to be wiped away.On the plus side, the pen is weighted nicely and feels comfortable in my hand. The ink bleeds through the paper. The ink flow is not consistent (sometimes it looks like a pen running out of ink). The ink blotches badly and randomly. The ink flows well. The ink dries fast and does not smudge. While writing with it, it apparently bust, because she had red ink all over her hand. I haven't noticed any ink blobs. The ink flows smoothly & evenly.....no skips. I don't know what Paper Mate's secret advanced ink system is, but it just doesn't work. Being retractable is a plus because ink doesn't get all over my purse and wallet. The ink flow on these pens are very good. They start writing immediately and the ink comes out nice, smooth, and crisp. The ink flows evenly and dries quickly. The ink flows thick and smooth but doesn't get messy or cause streaks. Also, the ink is more likely to smudge if you touch it after writing.Overall, I would not switch to these pens, and I can not recommend them. Most importantly, though, the ink just flows, so the pen glides smoothly across the page. The ink is of good quality and writes very clearly with minimal hand pressure and delivers crisp and clearly visible lines; recommended.1.Zebra Z-Grip Retractable Ballpoint Pen, Medium, 1.0 mm, Clear Barrel, Black Ink  12-Count (22210)2.Cross Contour, Satin Chrome, Ballpoint Pen, in a Gift Box (AT0322-1) The ink colors are basic, but bright and clean and the flow is honesty silky and nice.Is this a Cross pen? Though the ink does start as the pen hits paper, there are areas of light and dark color in the writing. Have not had the ink blot problem that others have had, at least not so far.T
