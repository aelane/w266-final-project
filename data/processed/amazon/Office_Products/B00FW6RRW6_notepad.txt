This is a neat looking magnetic notepad, that works exactly as you would expect.When opening this with a pair of scissors, watch out for a tiny elastic band at the bottom of the notepad. This skinny notepad fits nicely on my fridge. This notepad is pretty much as described, but I am hard pressed to see the value here for the price paid. This is a handy notepad that fits nicely on my fridge, but, I'd like it a lot better if the perforations for tearing each little sheet were along the left side rather than the top. All in all a great notepad. This magnetic notepad contains three separate sections. This is a really handy and cute notepad, which I have no problem sticking to my fridge door. I cannot recommend this notepad at all. A very nice magnetic notepad for the fridge or any magnetic bulletin board. This is a decent notepad. This is a cute notepad. They didn't hold well, and the notepad fell off the fridge or slid down it several times, til I added some additional magnets from my stash at home. This notepad is right up my alley. I would recommend looking for a notepad a little more conducive to everyday use. Otherwise, this is a standard notepad. I would rather the notepad just be blank which would give more room for writing. I am using this notepad in my work locker and it has a couple features that are well designed. When I received this magnetic notepad, I was concerned about the magnets, which are flat rectangles attached to the top and bottom of a long and very thick note pad, would not be strong enough to hold it to a metallic surface. It's a notepad. This notepad is somewhat handy, at times.
