Karge 1/3 tab gives good space for writing or putting a label on it. They have a large tab to write or label the contents, like a regular file folder.Highly recommended, practical and handy item to have on hand! There is a round tab at the top that helps keep papers in place. The tab is supersized and there are places to hold business cards and a Cd. The super tab pocket at the top is a very nice touch as I am just the type of clumsy oaf who spills papers out of the top of a folder when I start rooting around on my shelves and desk. They also have a tab in the center that will help to hold papers in place. There is a larger than normal tab that can be written on. The tab at the top felt flimsy to me. What I don't like is the tab at the top. The fold-down tab to "lock" in your papers is awesome. You never have to switch.The tab that holds the tops of the papers down works just right. I particularly like the tab on the inside  that helps to hold your papers in place. These come with a big tab for labeling, an inner opening for business cards and an inner opening that is five inches that can be used for other items.The "Lockit" flap looks like a half circle sticking out of the top of the folder. The tab on side is for labeling the folders, just like file folders. There is a tab for you to write on or add a sticker to label the contents. The tab that holds paper in place is a nice feature as long as it doesn't block anything important on the papers inside.

The tab is twice as big as a normal tab on a folder.

Well they can be, but then it smears.The big tab on them is nice.

A large tab on the upper-right hand side makes it function like any manila file folders.
