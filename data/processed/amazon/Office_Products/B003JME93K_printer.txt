We love being able to use a central printer with all of our devices without having to complicate our life any further with networking beyond our wifi router, and I love being USB cable free.The only tick I have ever encountered happens when I send something to the printer while it is coming on. This has been my main printer for over two years and I am very pleased with the printing quality and the speed of printing.Pros:1) Sets up quickly.2) Set up on my Router for wireless somewhat quickly.3) Works well as wireless printer.4) Superb photo quality (I use high quality photo paper).5) Scans quicky and does a great scanning job.6) Copies docs very fast and I am more than happy with the results.Cons: (One MAJOR)1) This printer DRINKS INK! All I wanted was a printer for photos. I will be replacing this printer. The printer does wonderful photos and it is a joy to use. Avoid this printer and HP. I got this printer at a decent price. I give this printer a full star because the scanner works nicely. You have to stop what you're doing, go open up the printer, pull out the offending piece of paper, and then hit the okay button. Great little printer. I had this printer for a little over a year and every time I print something, I always have to set it up over again. Well, it didn't come with the printer so why are we going to pay extra for something like that? A wireless printer should print and work WIRELESSLY.I gave up on setting up this printer and as time went on, it was recognized, but then if you print, it would say the printer isn't responding or has an error. I swear, it's so hard to find a budget-friendly 5-star printer. This is a decent low-end printer with a few very cool features, and satisfactory but not stellar performance. It would be the ideal printer for a small family, especially with children who like to print things (and what kids don't like to print things). That'll be nice because I may occasionally bring it home.WIRELESS:Setting up this printer as a wireless printer was extremely easy. I got this printer to replace my old HP Photosmart C4635 so there will be some comparisons made between my cheap printer and this new one. It is a generic USB printer cable so if you are replacing an old printer then you should be able to use the old printer USB cable. However, if this is your first printer, you would need to buy one and they got some cheap ones on Amazon. The printer is extremely light and fairly easy to set up. It was easy to use and you can either scan from the printer itself or use the software that comes with it on your computer. I bought this printer for a condo when I had thoughts of transporting one of my other printers from home. So far this printer fits the bill perfactly.
