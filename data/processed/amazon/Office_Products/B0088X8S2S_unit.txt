I am currently on my third crosscut unit, which is on its last legs with an ineffective paper sensor. On my unit I have to really push at it, to turn it on.This seems to be a fairly well designed shredder especially for the price, and looks like it should last a while. I wish this unit held a bag because the micro shredded papers goes everywhere every time the bin is opened. This limits where you can use the unit. The unit needs to cool off far too long and too frequently. This is not a unit for commercial use to say the least. I was surprised that the unit shredded the paper as though there was no staple attached. This unit makes cross cut micro confetti out your documents so your identity will definitely be protected. I don't like waiting for the unit to cool off so I can use it when all I'm trying to do is shred the day's mail.

I found this unit to be esthetically pleasing.

The unit I received appears to be unused, brand new.

The unit comes with the wheels attached.
