A good little product and one I wll continue to use. This product has pads of sticky notes of different sizes and colors stacked and bound together. They are perforated so that you can removed them  - but it is not totally easy to do this.The product looks and seems odd to me.Various colors are used - orange, yellow, green, blue and hot pink. But,this product allows the user to choose the color then tear it off at the top. This product begins with traditional paper sticky notes, comparable to 3M's Post-It brand except the sticky strip on the back of these is twice as wide as on Post-Its. But the product is expensive when compared to other standard 3" x 3" note pads such asAvery Sticky Notes Cube, 3 x 3 Inches, Assorted Bold Colors, 400 Sheets (22546). Excellent product!!! This is a unique new product from Avery. Great product! Overall, I like this product. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has to leave themselves reminders in many places and occasionally needs a longer sheet to write a longer note. I have to say I was a little skeptical about this product.
