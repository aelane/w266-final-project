If you are working in an office of more than 1 or 2, you'll have to designate someone as the paper loader, because the paper trays could be damaged by a rough handler. Also, while it says great for an office, I'm not seeing it. I think for a busy office you'd want a heavy duty printer separate from your faxing and phone lines.Lastly, the *** reference above is to the print. For office use, the printer looks to have the ability to last. (Or in an office setting, one for Legal one for Letter sized.) Then scan as a PDF and email it back to the office. However, for office use with color illustrations and casual photo printing, you will be very happy with this printer. I would highly recommend it for a small office environment. I would question it for office use because of some of the limitations below, but otherwise it is great.I am familiar with the Epson installation, so I understand some confusion people may have with the process. For office use I feel the ink cartridges should have a higher capacity.Also, Epson advertises that you can send double sided documents to the scanner and fax; this is true. This would also hinder an office. For office use I would definitely look at a printer that has a duplexer (assuming you will be doing double-sided printing.All in all I enjoy this little printer. It's very annoying in an office where faxes are sent several times every day. In office use the the text is high quality and very economical with the super size black pigment cartridge.
