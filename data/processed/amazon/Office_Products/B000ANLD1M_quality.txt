These are good quality labels. I believe them to be the finest quality with most extensive format selection within their niche. However, the quality is consistent and it is very good. High quality labels. They are of great quality and ink stays on it well. THey are durable, high quality and fully frustration free. These are good quality labels but you can find generic brands for less money and I have never really had a problem with cheaper, lower quality labels.These have 2 labels per page and if you cannot disable a bottom receipt portion from printing out, you will waste a label. Print quality was good, pealing them off was no hassle and running them through the print a second time caused no problems.

The quality has always been superb, but they're just priced too high for me & that's what I'd planned to say along with 4 stars (5 for quality, 3 for price).Well, I'm glad I printed a few first.

If quality is worth the extra expenditure to you, then these Avery labels are without a doubt a good buy.

These high quality shipping labels are really useful for covering old markings when you reuse a shipping box.
