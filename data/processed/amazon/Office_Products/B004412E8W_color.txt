I have not tested their color resistency (i.e., will water cause the folder to leak color onto something else, such as the important paper inside. I like them because they add a little color to my otherwise boring file drawer. Otherwise, you're probably better off with standard color or plain-manila folders. The color selection doesn't mean that much to me, but it is nice and I'm sure many who buy this product will appreciate them. You can also do color coding by type of files (red for tax documents, yellow for school stuff, blue for receipts, etc.) I use these to color code for different classes. Now I at least know what color of file to look for, so I cut down my search time greatly. By uniformly using a certain color for each product, we will very easily be able to identify the records pertaining to that particular product when a customer calls for service.

This is great for color coding different types of files and then keeping those types of files together.

No color transferred onto the paper towel until I dabbed it and then a very slight bit of red appeared.The flaps are easy to write on with a regular pen however because of their brilliant colors the writing can be difficult to read especially on the red and green folders.

I am a color coded person - red means "URGENT", yellow is marketing, green is personnel, etc.
