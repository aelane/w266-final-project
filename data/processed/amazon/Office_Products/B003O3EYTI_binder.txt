What I really like about this particular binder is the heavy stiff plastic that makes up the sides and binding of the whole thing. This binder is absolutely huge, and as others have remarked, is nothing like the ones we had in school. It's a sewn binder with some dividers added and a couple of pockets on the inside. HOWEVER, since this is clearly labelled as a &#34;binder&#34; and *not* a &#34;system&#34; (like the old ones were) I have to disagree with the haters, and say that it lives up to its name. It's just a binder, no pouches, no zippered pen & pencil pouches... simply: binder.That said, it does its job. This three ring binder comes with 5 full sheet vinyl subject dividers. Just the same simple 3 ring binder with 5 dividers. This is the sturdiest Mead binder I have gotten  this year. Overall , it is a nice and practical binder. The binder is covered in two shades of ugly black fabric. Nice binder, but bigger and bulkier than I remember from my childhood. Still a good little binder that seems sturdy.

I love this binder, and my only regret is that it wasn't available in the past years.

It's an ok binder for school and it will keep your folders and papers in place (although having to buy Trappers separately is nearly unforgivable...at least include a couple of them).

This binder is overpriced.
