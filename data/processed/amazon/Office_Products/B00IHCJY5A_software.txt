Then, on using it, the software for setting up scans comes with two choices and neither is any good in terms of being intuitive or simple or helpful. If you're familiar with Epson software (I own 2 other printers by this brand) the set up is typical of this company. &#34;Firmware updating&#34; only seems to be required for those not in the USA, the software will auto prompt for any updating needed for drivers (if you're a US resident), so you can ignore this brochure that's included. You're instructed to install all software first before hooking up the scanner. After the software installation, you simply plug the scanner into the computer. But it's the software where I was a little disappointed. The software took a good bit to install as well, but at twenty minutes or so, it wasn't egregious. Just awful software and documentation, particularly related to the wireless setup. Googling, I found it redirected me to the standard Epson software updater... which did not provide any firmware update, nor even provide any feedback on the firmware. Close Document Capture.The software functionality is typical Epson, with options squirreled away in several different tabs and buttons, and not all options available in all places (e.g., Epson Scan vs Document Capture job setup).Note: If you're a Mac user, there is no software included to create searchable PDF's, one of the top features listed for the scanner. The software issues, difficulty in setting up a Wifi connection other than via WPS, inability to switch between Wifi and USB modes, and the lack of an included carrier sheet drops one star for me. The accompanying software was easy to install and is easy to use. This software isn't too bad about that.Paper documents: When I printed up a couple of paper documents that had been scanned, it was hard to tell the copies, except that they hadn't been folded to go into an envelope. To be fair, the ScanSnap software has its own issues, but it looks like Fujitsu made more of an effort to integrate all the parts so it is relatively seamless.Someone with developed technological skills would find this hardware useful, but there are better choices. I tell the software that it did not connect. The software is relatively self explanatory, with a few &#34;modern&#34; features I haven't seen with my old scanners. The software supports a few different cloud services for scanning directly to upload, including Google Drive, and this feature worked well. The best software is made to handle errors with many consumers will ultimately make.The scanner is quiet and fast and like most things Epson is very well made and offers great value.

You have to just keep fooling with the software - it's not what I would call user-friendly.

This is not convenient2) the software itself is rather confusing.

This is important, because if it does not, and you mistakenly say it does, there's no going back during software installation to fix that error.
