The rings sit flat on the back cover instead of the spine, if that matters to you. The rings, unfortunately, are some of the stiffest rings I've ever encountered &#8211; this thing is quite hard to open and close! And I much prefer D rings to regular round ones, makes for better alignment of contends and holds more. I have also had the rings of the binder get stuck after only a few uses which makes the binder all but trash.This binder has a one year guarantee and seems like it will stand the test of time. If the rings give out, I'll update my review. The rings also close with a small cylindrical extension into the other side of the ring, which I think should be more effective in keeping the rings straight than the alternative ridge closure system I've seen on other binders.I think the D-ring is probably good for holding a bit more paper since the left (ring) side won't be as high off the back of the binder. Conversely, the circular rings are probably easier for flipping back and forth through pages. It is plenty heavy and the rings are strong and have a easy open design. The rings and clasps on the inside are made of strong metal some of these are real cheap but not these.Wilson Jones binders are the best out there! The rings close tightly, and the paper does not get caught on them. The D rings are mounted so that the pages stay flat when I open it up. The D-rings  seem stronger than old fashioned O rings, in addition to being able to hold more sheets of paper. These rings help to prevent that.The claim is that these Polypro Binders last up to 10X longer. It also has the wonderful D rings with the dimple to hollow closure. It has D rings instead of the round ones, which means it will open and close a bit better in my opinion.The front/back/spine are clear plastic over the white binder plastic allowing you to add your own customized inserts. D rings are such an improvement over the round rings.

Well made it features powerful D rings that open easily and close securely.

The rings hold tight so papers don't go flying down the hallway, making your kid look like a nerd.

The rings close shut tightly and securely so that no paper can come out.
