These are great removable labels that can be used for retail or home use. These labels live up to the great quality I have come to expect from their company. These labels really look sharp and professional they are printed with a laser printer (feeds flawlessly in my Okidata C3200 Color Laser Printer) and includes our company logo along with the sale information.The package contains ten sheets, each with twelve 2" x 2.5" labels that have to be printed all at the same time (according to the instructions) and have a removable backing on the "tab" section to expose the sticky surface for attaching to a shelf. These labels work best in a laser printer. I like to use Word to make labels. Unlike with labels though, you need to print the entire sheet because it can't be fed through again once you pull it apart.The individual labels can be a bit confusing at first. I recently discovered these labels and I LOVE them! The other is to produce labels in-house that requires downloading a wizard or blank templates or pre-designed ones for Microsoft Word, Adobe software, or Apple Pages. There are 120 large labels, plenty for 10 or 12 different applications. The labels are quite small, but the size makes them perfect for shelf labels. These labels are perfect for in-store displays. Just perfect.The only caveat - these labels are marketed for using with a LASER printer so hopefully you have a color laser printer laying around for superb results. I have not yet tried these labels with our inkjet but with a laser printer they look SHARP as though printed via a local commercial print shop.These labels are 2.5" by 2" and come 12 to a sheet (4 wide by 3 tall). These are great removable labels from Avery! I had to search in the "labels" category for the correct template. I would like bigger labels and perhaps better stick because they don't stick well to textured surfaces.But they are cute discreet labels that work well in my pantry and office.
