The clear plastic pockets on the inside are useful for stray extra papers. The pockets on the inside wall of each side of the binder will tear within a couple of uses. The four interior pockets allow you to tuck loose papers. It has see through pockets on the outside where pages can be inserted. It also has clear double pockets on the inside front and back covers. *Clear pockets on the front, back, and spine of the binder to display title pages, contents, index, etc. *Two pockets each for the inside of the covers to hold additional loose paper/documents. *Clear pockets are resistant to toner or ink transfer which prevents printed pages from getting stuck.Slight drawback:*Clear pockets may tear after repeated use.Overall:We've been using these binders at our office for paper documents without any problems. The 3 outside pockets let me insert (or not) a 8x10 picture on the front and back, in the spine I usually put a book mark I have acquired at some bookstore in the past 12 months - lots of great memories. The two inside pockets are terrific, I am hoping they will change them to full page instead of the current third of the page they are.I usually use white or blue and the color adds to the display. There are 4 inner pockets for extra storage and the outside of the binder can be fully customized.I took advantage of the Wilson Jones template builder on the companies website. There are four pockets inside but I doubt if I will put stuff in it because with the binder already full, if I do put papers in the pockets, it will just make the cover bulge. I also love that there's 2 pockets on the inside of each cover, one that's at the usual height, and another further up with the first one on top of it. Lastly, there are two staggered pockets in the front and back, this allows for easier organization of your papers. I noticed that the plastic pockets on the exterior front and back are a little looser on the top which allows for inserting a sheet of paper or cardstock and removing it without a struggle. There are also two clear plastic pockets for holding miscellaneous papers on both the front inside and back inside; the top pocket is about five inches higher than the bottom pocket.My binder looked mostly brand new when I opened it out of the packaging, but it did have some grey marks on the inside cover, and the outside front cover was a bit pushed up at the ends due to tight packaging. The inside pockets are great for organization and there are four of them, making it really good for organizing any subject.The rings are secured because you have to press at both ends to release. I especially like the double pockets in the front cover, which make it easy for my child to keep her piano music organized. I love the pockets on the inside so I can separate papers that do not belong together. I also like that it has four pockets on the inside (two on the front cover and two on the back cover). Con is that there are not any pockets on side to put papers in. The four pockets (two on the inside of the front cover, two on the back cover) are strong. There are pockets on front and back that you can put in a photo if you would like or something to let you know what is in this particular binder. There are two larger pockets on the inside as well as two smaller pockets below the larger ones to hold receipts or such. There are two clear plastic pockets on EACH inside, one taller and one shallower for shoving in some papers at the front and back  (since this is such a huge binder, the front pocket is actually extra wide) for a total of 4 pockets. It has clear pockets to slide whatever identifying paper or design you would like in there.
