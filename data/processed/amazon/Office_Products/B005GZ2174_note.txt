The sticky note that has been thus accidentally removed is a familiar problem.The Post-it Super Sticky Full Adhesive note is like the mirror image of the original. Likewise, the note may remove a bit of ink from the surface of the document to which it is adherent. This won't replace the traditional sticky note because you can't use these and leave part of the note sticking out of a book or a binder but they are something I will buy and use often. I love this Post-it note for two important reasons. I can not make a quick note when I'm fiddling with the edge to try and get one off quickly. I don't have to worry about them falling off and my note getting lost..and as I work a lot from home and have to send actual paperwork back and forth, it's just perfect for my needs.I may even try them as gift tags for our holiday presents... I have always struggled with post-it note style post-its because the glue was never very reliable. This obviously prevents the sticky note from curling up, which can be annoying in many instances. I stick the note right above the row of knitting I'm working, and I move the note when I'm done with the row.

The entire note is sticky... not just the top 1/2 inch.

The ENTIRE note can be placed somewhere without the thought that it will be removed by someone just simply brushing by it.

If you want to make a note of when things have to be mailed put on one of these and put a paper clip or rubber-band on it and you have a reminder.They might be more money then the store brand or generic but they are worth it as they work well do not leave any residua when removing and I love the new rounded edges to remove them.
