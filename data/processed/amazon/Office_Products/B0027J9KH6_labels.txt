It even integrates with Mac OS X and allows you to print labels by selecting anyone in your Mac's address book. The labels are best used for shipping, or things that require temporary labeling (less than six months). These labels WILL fade after time, and will fade very quickly if left in direct sunlight or in an overly hot environment. Generic labels won't work because you need an activation code on the labels. The generic labels themselves retail for a penny, so you are basically paying them 8 cents per stamp.We use about 12 stamps per week, so the fee is going to be about $4 per month. I am glad I purchased this Label Writer for labels. I do use it to print labels. I use the large labels to mail flats, and the smaller labels for file folders and some envelopes. You can also print 4X6 labels for most of your packages. I use non-Dymo labels available elsewhere on Amazon since they're a fraction of the price and work perfectly.This replaced a single-feed 450 that I had (and which still worked perfectly). Also, Dymo would much rather you use their own labels at 2 or 3 times the cost of the generics you'll find on Amazon, and that's just annoying. I already own the Label Writer Duo (labels and tape printer) and wanted to add another printer to avoid swapping labels all the time. You will want to buy more labels when you order the labeler. I've used 'compatible' labels for years without a problem, and they are considerably cheaper than the Dymo brand.caveats:The labeler WOULD NOT work when plugged in to the USB port on the keyboard (I confirmed this on 3 different Macs). You will need to keep labels loaded at all times to avoid this.The power supply is external, if consists of a power brick and a standard Unpolarized C7 Cord.
