For simply marking a box fragile this is fine, but the colors don't pop enough like fluorescent stickers.Poor implementation of a good idea. I would not use it exclusively to seal a box I was sending out without reinforcing it with stronger tape. The other box looked like a mummy and was not as professional looking. So it CAN'T be used as your primary box sealing tape. To be honest, it didn't quite seem like it was thick/strong enough to hold a very heavy box securely. I don't know if I would use it exclusively to tape up a box, but a quick circle around the middle of a box makes it easy to identify. Since a box has 6 sides and you never know which side will be facing the package handlers, I choose to add a strip of tape all the way around the box in two directions to cover all sides. Simply secure your box or package with the tape you normally trust to seal it. The box was medium large and heavy so I taped it with regular clear sealing/mailing tape and then put this tape over that. With the box jostled around, dropped, loaded and unloaded in our car, there was no problem with it ripping or coming undone.The tape itself reminds me of the Priority tape from the USPS. As far as replacing your normal box sealing tape with this? It's not as good as normal box sealing tape, and it's more expensive.
