We are very happy with this stapler. The Paper Pro stapler is one of the smoothest staplers I have ever used. Before trying the PaperPro EvoLX Desktop stapler I was using an old fashioned Swingline, metal, heavy duty stapler that required picking up and pressing with all of my hand or leaving on the desk and slapping really hard to staple one document. I never knew a stapler could be so easy to use! This is the first stapler I have used that is truly effortless to use and does not cause any strain or pain in the palm of my hand. Also, the stapler uses standard staples, which makes it even better. Really good stapler. This stapler has outlasted all my other staples combined. A stapler is a stapler, right? Actually owning a stapler seemed like a big commitment and a lot of responsibility for somebody who has spent his life using the standard-issue staplers passed down through generations of workers, but I was ready for it. Have you ever had a stapler that you wanted to hurl as far as possible, due to constant jamming and poor performance? When the same happens with a stapler, it isn't quite as consequential, but still a little disappointing. There is no warning on this stapler and I would have expected that there might be.The stapler is light and this makes it feel a little non-durable. Loading it is tricky, since you must turn the stapler upside down and slide the lower housing back. I'm expecting to carry this stapler home when I do eventually decide to retire. While this is not the most intuitive stapler to load, once you figure it out, it staples like a champ. The stapler doesn't have great directions for loading the staples. Turn the stapler upside down, pull up on the black bottom section, and then slide it back. You also can't open up this stapler so you can use it on bulletin boards, but it's very good at regular stapling. Overall, it's a very nice stapler especially if you've been hassling with an old-fashioned heavy metal one that you have to thump with your palm for any kind of effect. This is an easy stapler to use to staple items. All in all it is a great stapler that only takes a little amount of pressure to use. This stapler is spring powered and will easily make the 20 page claim. This is a very easy-to-use stapler. It's quite light and, because it's more curved than your regular stapler, looks more compact on your desk. It's not an electric stapler but it's not quite a manual one either. This stapler is great. I cannot accurately describe how to open the stapler. Take your stapler, take out all the staples and press down.. it is even smoother than that!It comes with 1/4" staples, (I am unsure if it works with longer staples all the staples I have here are 1/4").Some notes:1) It is not 100% metal, the top is plastic, however he rest is metal, and the body where the staples slide is thick cast metal.2) You CAN NOT use this to staple to a wall flat surface.3) To load the stapler you flip it upside down, slide the body away from the base, and load the staples into the body itself, points upThat's about it.. this is a GREAT stapler!A note about taking your frustrations out at work on your stapler:We have an all-metal Swingline staplers here. If you use a stapler a lot at work, you know that some are a little hard on the hands if you are putting together a bunch of briefing packets at one time. This stapler works VERY nicely, over and over again. But, be warned that even though the stapler CAN do more than 20 pages, due to the physical length of the staples they don't fold over and will stick mostly straight out the back. Every stapler I've owned eventually jams, and then you have to pry out the jammed staples.The second best thing is the ease of reloading it. It's a trouble-free stapler that hopefully will last for years.Note: My first sample stapled only intermittently, but Amazon replace it promptly, and the new sample works perfectly.Update: a year and a half later, this stapler still works perfectly. I use this stapler a lot. I didn't think it was possible for a stapler to get even easier than what I had. That is, this only works as a regular stapler. Given how light this stapler is, I was pretty skeptical that it would be a keeper. And I mean zero - like how a regular stapler acts when there aren't any staples in it.The only minor issue I have with this stapler is that you refill the staples (which are standard-size, by the way) by removing the base (not the top). good stapler This stapler works as advertized: it requires less force than my old Swingline and it can do 20 sheets in a breeze.There is a quirk however that is unlike the "standard" staplers that get the staple to go through as you press down. A solid, attractive stapler that suits my modern aesthetic.Easy-to-use as advertised, putting a staple through multiple layers of paper without any effort on my part, but without the loud sound of a power stapler or staple-gun. It is an excellent stapler far tougher then my old metal relics. I am amazed at how well this stapler works. I didn't expect a stapler to surprise me, but using the PaperPro made me feel happy about stapling. This is a manual mechanical stapler that works almost like a electrical stapler. this stapler is totally effortless. This stapler is effortless to use. With this stapler, all you do is turn it upside down and easily slide the body across. This is a lightweight stapler that really does fire a staple through 20 pieces of paper. Seriously, I would have never, ever believed I could be so excited by a stapler. LOVE this stapler, it is incredibly easy to use. With this stapler it is a breeze, every day but Sunday - then I have to use the big, expensive electric stapler.That said, it took an engineer and a librarian close to half an hour to figure out how to get the staples into the thing. I would highly recommend this stapler to anyone with hand strength issues like arthritis or carpal tunnel as it takes literally no force at all to use it.As some other reviews have pointed out, the instructions on filling it need a lot of work but other than that, this is the stapler to have. I found the PaperPro EvoLX Desktop Metal Stapler to be a good stapler but with a twist - its mechanism. This stapler, like its cousin the PaperPro Evo, has a internal spring setup similar to a staple gun (but much less powerful) so that no matter how many sheets of paper you are stapling, it always takes the same amount of pressure to activate.
