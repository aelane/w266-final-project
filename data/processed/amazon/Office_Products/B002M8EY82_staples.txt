And it is easy enough to load staples into once you figure out it is a little different than the old one you are use to. I took the staples in and out multiple times but though I could see them loaded, the stapler would not staple through my 3 sheets of paper. I finally loaded the staples directly into the stapler, versus putting them in the slide and lo and behold it worked. Standard staples I had for another stapler worked fine. Using regular staples, we zoomed through the project. One major plus is that it uses standard staples, so it is very inexpensive to refill.I'm a little hard pressed to say how different it is from the previous model, but this isn't much of an issue, since I really like both of them. It uses standard staples so you don't need to buy different types from what you may already use. With this one, you drop the staples into a channel. There were just enough staples for a single load, one row, so I started stapling. It uses standard 1/4-inch staples, which are up to the task for up to about 28 sheets.Opened up it can be used as a simple tacker, useful for posting notices on bulletin boards and such. It is so easy to use and staples effortlessly. It truly staples many sheets together without having hanging staples sticking out that rip off one's skin.This is one of those items you do not realize you need until you try it. It says it "uses standard 1/4" staples" on the box. It's incredibly annoying to have to rip staples out of a stack of paper because it either jammed, didn't go through correctly or both.
