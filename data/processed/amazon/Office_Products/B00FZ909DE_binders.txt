Definitely worth it over cheapie binders. I work with binders frequently at work, and they get a lot of wear and tear from removing papers constantly, and refilling them back up. I usually get the regular Avery black binders, but decided to give the Wilson Jones brand a try.First, and foremost, the binder seems HUGE. I use binders for collecting research and have several of different brands. These binders have D-rings that supposedly hold up to 25% more paper than round ring binders, and last ten times longer than a comparable binder made of vinyl, but judging from the appearance, I'm not sold on this information. Polypro binders are more eco-friendly than vinyl binders and last up to 10X longer. Built to last, these binders have 3 never-gap round rings to provide spill-free document security. We normally get our 3&#34; binders from C ostco. These large binders work well for that purpose. I have had to throw many binders away due to warped rings, or rings that don't shut completely. I have several of these binders that vary in size and so far I have been impressed with the quality in relation to the pricing. When purchasing binders, one needs to consider the use you have intended for them. I use mainly heavy-duty Avery binders and they always contain that cover sheet and a sticker on the spine that states the thickness of the binder.
