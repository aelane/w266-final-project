I have never adjusted either gun. The gun is small and lightweight enough to be easily maneuvered into fairly tight spots.It also worked very well with fir and poplar. This gun ended up working great and getting the job done. I loaded the gun and it did not shoot out any staples. The gun worked very well.When I loaded up two (2) strips of staples it jammed. What I DIDN'T expect was how easy this gun was to handle and use! I mention that because my electric gun has a wonky control dial and I always get 3 or 4 staples in rapid succession-- not the case with this Arrow.I can't believe the price on this-- the gun feels a lot more substantial and well-built. Great little gun! The gun is consistent in pushing the staples into the wood.Hubby does wish that there were a swivel on the compressor cable connector. )After all that was cleared up, the gun works great and is easy to use. )It's a fairly solid gun, but for lightweight projects.
