Luckily, I have both & they work well on these file folders. If looking for erasable hanging file floders trySmead Erasable FasTab Hanging Folders, 1/3-Cut Tab, Letter, Moss, 20 per Box (64032) I have dealt with file folders for many years and the tabs on them are the most important part. Make your file system even more organized by searching out some different colored markers. When I found I didn't need a file folder anymore, I often grabbed a sticker or label to relabel it for a new task. These are adequate file folders with an erasable writing area that is tested to work with permanent marker and white eraser. Sturdy file folders with double the label area compared to regular file folders. These terrific file folders really are erasable, simply use a white eraser or a bit of rubbing alcohol.There is a gloss strip on the tab, as long as you stay on it, and use a marker like a fine Sharpie-type, it can be wiped off.So neat and easy!

And I write all over the file folders, phone calls, names, dates, important information, so they aren't reusable anyway.I tried using these as a temporary storage filling system while I was doing the health insurance stuff and our taxes.

However, it is amazing in and of itself to have erasable file folders and the technology to do it requires using a permanent pen (I use a Sharpie) and a white polymer eraser to remove the writing later.I have no trouble with smudging or removing anything I have written on these folders and I particularly like the larger "super" tab.

There ends up being an ugly smear.These file folders have extra large tabs, making the labels easier to see, and they are reusable, so that the label area can be cleanly erased and written over, again and again.There is no degradation of the manila paper either when you erase on these, as I did when I tried the erasure aspect of these out.
