These are probably the finest dry-erase markers I've used. These are good solid markers. These markers write in deep bold colors and erase from dry erase boards easily. Some cheaper markers, the tip will tend to dry a bit as you're writing. Love these markers to go with my dry erase board. I get tired of the standard large markers, since I'm not teaching to a class or a group of people far away, just making notes for myself. I really like these dry-erase markers. It was great to have markers that you do not need to worry about the smell, especially if you are using them constantly. Broad-tip markers are fine, but it's nice having something a little finer if you're actually writing out a bunch of software kind of stuff.These are fairly reasonably priced and look / perform great. The markers are similar in size to the previous packaging (see example of the old packaging B0040HXRMC). The Enduraglide markers not only maintain optimum color, but they erase fully, even when the writing is left on the board for days. It's great!You can use these markers to write notes, or if you have small children, have them practice their handwriting, saving paper and trees!These markers write smoothly and the colors are consistent, unlike some others that make inconsistent thicknesses.Here is a major win for these: The tips can't get smashed into the body! Only 4 markers came, even though the product title says 5-pack. These markers are excellent for saving space. So far, I've been pretty satisfied with these markers. These markers are comfortable in my arthritic hands and I am able to write on the board with them for quite a while. However, the typical markers are the same style ones you use in grade school: thick writing with that toxic smell. For actual writing these markers are fine. These markers work great with the Quartet dry erase board, they glide with ease and don't streak. I've always used Expo markers and so I suppose that's the standard I judge these by. They erase very clean as well - perhaps cleaner than the Expo markers (which seem to leave a stain on the whiteboard at times). These markers work great. It is easy to write and erase these markers. Overall, I like the markers and am happy with them. These erasable markers offer more control and fine detailing points than regular wipe off markers. What I like best about the markers is that you can see how much ink is still left in the pen. These markers can be used on any dry-erase boards or non-porous surfaces. I am very happy with these dry-erase markers. These dry-erase markers aren't that exciting but they do have some thoughtful design features: they are a nice, smallish size so they don't seem like a child's art project markers, they have caps designed to prevent them from rolling, they draw a medium-width line, and best of all you can see how much ink they have left! These markers write very smoothly, have no overpowering scent, and erase easily. These premium markers definitely have the best color I've ever seen.They also erase really easily, which is super awesome.I'm only an occasional user of whiteboard markers, and these seem to be lasting fine, but I can't comment on how they would hold up to heavy use. After using these, I have discovered just how crappy the markers are that came with my dry erase boards! These markers have fairly good saturation and a rounded tip for easy writing. My 7-year old uses these markers daily while practicing spelling words and the tips have not smashed down despite repeated use. We've had markers that remained uncapped overnight and they didn't dry out. Unlike many dry-erase markers, these don't erase themselves when you write through or over them. These markers are just what you expect. These seem to write longer than regular dry-erase markers without drying out. * The markers glide more smoothly than any others I've tried -- it's like they have more of a wet feel than most dry erase markers -- but they don't smear easily, either. The Quartet EnduraGlide markers write smoothly in bold colors and erase cleanly with ease. These markers are serving us well. These markers are smaller with fine points. I've used Expo markers in the past and always had the problem of them drying out so quickly and staining my dry erase board, but I don't have that problem with these! These aren't what I'D call fine-tip markers, but I don't really want fine tips for a whiteboard anyway. This is what all markers should do, but too often you get faint marks, fuzzy lines, and an unreasonable attachment to the whiteboard.I tried to figure out some reason for the flaring shape, but it appears to be purely decorative. We accept that these markers die. We accept this do we not?These markers are like a new generation of marker pens. We use three out of the four markers right now, and will use the other once one of those runs out. These markers have rounded tips that make what ever is written look sharp. I have left writing from these markers on a dry-erase board over night and it was easy to erase the next day.These are fine dry-erase markers. These markers are currently 4 for $6.99 so about $1.75 each. That's significantly more expensive, but these are definitely better markers. They erase more cleanly (cheap markers leave residue and shed dust). These markers work better than any other dry erase markers I've used - the ink is bold and flows consistently. Not much to say other than all markers work well and I definetely prefer these over the big bulky ones and the pencil thin ones. Too often Dry-erase markers are way too watered down and skippy. The markers do have very visible bold colors, and the point is fine enough for printing and even some cursive on the white boards we have. I've previously used markers from another manufacturer that just happened to be what was available to me via the department/organizational logistics team. These markers produce vivid colors that are easy to see and distinguish on both white and gray backgrounds. However, since these markers are smaller and hold less ink, they may not last any longer than bigger markers with wider tip. I recommend these markers, though only for smaller white boards and/or for close viewing (for example, on a personal whiteboard next in your home or next to your desk). Especially if you use them quite often.These markers are considered "Fine" tip but to be honest, this isn't my definitions of a fine tip. I did not like these markers at all because they are translucent - sheer, difficult-to-see color that makes writing difficult to see at a distance. For me, these markers aren't the worst but also not the best.
