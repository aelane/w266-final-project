I used to only buy Mead paper when I was in high school and college, there was no doubt that it was a thicker paper than most others. This paper will definitely do the job you need it to do but so will some other cheaper brands (currently it is $2.99 on Amazon). This is filler paper that comes pre-punched with three holes to be inserted into a 3-hole binder.The paper is thick enough that you won't see through it and can write on both sides. This paper is on the thinner side and there are only 200 sheets in the packet. This paper does not provide anything special for the extra money (it's currently $2.99 per 200 sheets on Amazon). The paper is pretty good &#8211; it&#8217;s not the really thick paper I remember from my own youth, which was so course that I could actually see the pulp fibers in it with the naked eye! It seems to me to be good, normal, wide ruled paper. Come on, paper is paper and ruled refills are rule refills.True, but there is a bit more to it.It all depends on how you like to write. (I know, anachronistic) thus, I need paper that will not let the fountain pen ink, that is liquid instead of a gel like ball points or gel pens, seep through the paper.I'm glad to say that this is a solid paper, that holds the ink and has proper texture.I recommend it without reservations. This paper is really well priced, but it seems a little flimsy. I wouldn't mind paying double what this costs to get paper that's just a little thicker. It is perhaps not the thickest paper out there so if you are looking for something thicker, you might need to look elsewhere. Still it is fairly standard paper. I am sending this paper with my daughter for her school. This is paper. I've been using Mead lined paper all my life. The paper is the perfect size for binders and manila envelopes.The Amazon price is a bit steep, as I can get paper cheaper at big box stores in town. Keep this paper in a dry area, as the lines can run if the paper gets wet. This is your standard 3 ring binder paper that is Wide Ruled. This is standard wide ruled filler paper. Also the Mead paper seemed a little thinner/ lower quality. This paper if so thin that it's totally transparent when you hold it up to the light. The paper might be a little thin but the printed lines were great, not to overpowering and no misses. I have been using Mead paper since I was a little boy and it has always done a great job. This budget-quality paper might be OK for elementary school kids, but I'd recommend heavier weight paper for anything else. Mead knows paper. This paper is perfect for school kids. It is just plain old lined paper. But it is such bad paper. Be careful of paper dimensions. The paper is thin and rips easily. It's notebook paper &#8230; What's to say. This notebook paper isn't the best that I've used. The wide ruled paper is perfect for some children that write bigger. Other than that, the paper has no other flaws and works nicely as notebook paper. I got this paper for my first grader to practice writing with. I never thought I would complain about binder paper, but this paper is pretty awful. The paper, while it serves its purpose, is really quite thin. I wouldn't recommend using pen on this paper, and heaven forbid you try to use marker or anything liquid on it. However, with wide ruled paper, most people who use it are little kids...and if your kid is like mine, erasing is practically a full arm production. The paper is not durable enough to withstand the erasing of a six year old or from people who are vigorous when erasing.That aside, the paper does serve its purpose. You can get much higher quality paper at a comparable price. It's notebook paper, so what's to judge? The paper is very thin and the writing shows on the other side of the sheet quite a bit. This is wide ruled paper and is easier for grades 1-3 to form their words on.There are 200 sheets of paper in a pack with drilled holes and fit perfectly in a 1 inch binder. This is basic filler paper. Our paper has all the holes, margins, and lines in the appropriate places, and the lines were dark enough to be visible. This is good paper and the price is very reasonable. It seems like paper is always in short supply around here. We need a quality paper and this seems to do the trick.This paper is thick enough and smooth so writing on it is effortless. Decent paper at a decent price. However, I find the paper to be thinner than expected which may be an issue for those who exert significant pressure when they write or those who rely on their trusty eraser to get them through the day. This is much thinner paper than I remember from when I was in school. If you want paper that will last, then you may want to shop for something thicker. Additionally, I also use it a backing paper with nice stationery, so that I don't use more than one sheet of nice stationery for a letter--I use the nice piece as the first page, and these cut to size for other sheets. This is traditional wide-ruled, three-hole paper. Cheap enough to toss and to use as scrap paper. I feel this is below average notebook paper here.T
