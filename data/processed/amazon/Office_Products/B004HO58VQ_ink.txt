Not so economical on ink but great photo quality output comparable to lab qualiity photos. The ink cartridges snap right into the print head itself.Unfortunately, it seems as though all the printer manufacturers are playing the same expensive ink cartridge game, so I guess I can't put too much blame on Canon for this. The ink seems to run out with very little printing. I know my ink cartridges aren't leaking because otherwise there would be ink filling up the wells around where the cartridges feed the print head. I thought maybe this was an ink clog (it might still possibly be an ink clog), so I ordered a cleaning kit. The ink was the wrong color and left a green cast on photos that I printed. I also tried some compatible ink cartridges that I bought through Amazon. And the ink color was definitely off. I absolutely could not believe how fast the ink was disappearing. I used up several ink cartridges without doing any printing except for nozzle checks the last few times I turned the printer on. I know this because I was carefully monitoring the ink levels while turning the printer on and off and printing only a couple of nozzle test pages.One of the worst losses I've suffered isn't the money I spent on the printer or on ink. I went through a LOT of ink cartridges in a very short time. There must be some good ink out there and some way to use good refillable cartridges, but I don't know what. I already bought some bad bulk ink from PrintPayLess, for instance. Bad ink is a common problem! The ink is extremely easy to install, and I am very impressed by this system.

All the the colored ink cartridges have by now been replaced by much less expensive cartridges (with chip) purchased from abacus24-7, in some cases more than once, however, I can see no change in the quality of the printed photos.

I have used their ink for several years with good results and the same is true with this printer.

It comes with ink, which is a bonus.
