68 gel pens what is not to love. These gel pens have come a long way in terms of price point and quality. These gel pens work just fine, and feel comfortable in the hand. I very much prefer gel pens to regular ink pens. Most of the gel pens I have used have been blue, red or black - this collection has more colors than I have ever seen and is perfect for all kinds of artistic work.Typical of most other gel pens I have used, these pens write very smoothly. The gel flows very smoothly and the pens write without skipping or blotting. The gel also dries reasonably quickly which cuts down on smears. These gel pens come with a wide variety of good, fun colors, which is the first thing that I look for when getting multiple packs of pens. I bought these gel pens because my daughter and I like to do crafts.

These gel pens are really just average.

I especially like gel pens.

I'm delighted by these gel pens but to get an idea whether they'll work for you depends on whether you'll use them in similar situations.
