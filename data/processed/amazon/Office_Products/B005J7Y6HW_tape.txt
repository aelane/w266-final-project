It supports 6mm, 9mm, and 12mm tape widths. I have been able to try out various tape cartridges, too.I have to say, if you decide to invest on this label maker then absolutely DO make it worth every penny and purchase the extra tape styles. The standard tape holds up to two lines of text depending on the font size. I love the glow-in-the-dark tape and plan to use it to label my doorbell. The tape clips close to the end of the text for the label. Installing the tape cartridge is easy as well. It's clear the tape cartridge can only go in one way, and then you just give it a little push to snap it in. The only negative is that the tape costs more than it should and is tougher to locate - but the product is excellent and supposedly the tape is longer and lasts longer(?). So buy some more lable tape on line and store it.

The tape cartridges were a piece of cake to pop in and out of the LW-300 (you pop off the back cover, pull out the current cartridge, put in new and snap on back cover... 10 secs).

It also seems to waste less tape than the Brother does, which is a nice feature, since the tapes aren't cheap.

Unfortunately the tape will only fit two lines (and there's an enter key to go from one line to the next) so what I've been doing is to put my last name and street address on the first line and the city, state and zip on the second line and it works fine.I've also made labels for those cords that come with your electronic toys that don't have any name on them and you can't figure out what goes with what.
