And then your pens stay put in their little case instead of rolling all over the desk and being knocked behind furniture by the cats.The second-best thing is that there are 36 colors, which is a good wide selection. I was really excited to get these pens. These pens have lots of colors and have a very smooth ink delivery. I love BIC pens. The pens are nice and the cool and warm colors are beautiful hues and shades. The pens come in a clear plastic case that opens into three parts, and each pen is securely gripped by the case. It allows you to store the pens inside it in a compact fashion that lets you tuck the packaged set away in a drawer or even vertically, like a book. Otherwise, you're paying for pens you won't be using. It holds then pens in order and folds open for easy access. The pens themselves work fine. The pens are very nice to write on other material besides regular paper, otherwise they bleed through very easily.

And as much as they do bleed, the pens are not running out of ink for us very quickly.They may say permanent, but they aren't sharpies.
