These round labels are made of a thicker, glossier paper than ordinary labels and the finished product is beautiful--they print to the edge, so there's no ugly white border around your label when you're finished.Use Avery's online template designer to pick a colorful design for quick jobs; just enter code 22807 to get started.The finished product is very professional looking, as though you'd sourced the job to a professional Print Shop. I have tried these round labels before and I find these to be much improved. I like the round labels to use on various homemade items that I make for Christmas and other holidays. Avery has made a nice round label which is glossy white and can be used on an ink jet or laser printer and results in a brilliantly colored image that will not run.I used the template which works with Word. The round labels are perfect! These round labels encourage you to create labels that are not text-based, however, so Microsoft Word may not be your first choice of editor. I also figured that since they were round, I'd have a harder time lining everything up correctly. If I had a pre-made round image ready to go that I could have just pasted on there I probably would have been fine. They look so much more professional than if it were a round logo on a square white label. The round white stickers can be used to make beautiful highlights for any package or document. These Avery round labels print just fine on my Canon deskjet printer, but I do have the same problem as other reviewers in trying to align the template just right. We had a round logo that was in a square document but it went in with no problems.
