The 3M Easy Adjust Desk Mount Monitor Arm (single mount) was simple to assemble, snapping together like kids' plastic blocks. This mount was easy to put into place, and it did a nice job of both adequately supporting my 28&#34; monitor, and allowing me to adjust it's position or swing it out of the way. The VESA mount comes with finger-screw bolts so you don't even need a screwdriver. I did find that the VESA mount had too high of tension even with the tension screw completely loosened. Basically, this mount will work for almost any desk size. Because of this I had guessed this single mount would be similar. Even the VESA mount screws are supplied and they are thumb type (BRILLIANT).Totally recommend!Thanks for reading my review! This mount makes it easy to move this behemoth around, I did attach the arm with screws but it may have been just fine with the clamp. The 3M Desk Mount Monitor Arm is a very stable, solid mount to use when you are looking to make more space on your desk. The mount itself is extremely stable, having survived both my husband and teenager taking it through its motions with our 17" widescreen HP monitor. The mount comes extremely well-packaged, with individually labeled boxes inside the large shipping box. I did not use the knob-style mount screws came with the 3M Monitor Arm and used the ones already attached to the monitor. These knob-style mount screws were very thoughful and this would make the installation process smooth.The 3M Easy Adjust Desk Mount Monitor Arm was a perfect monitor arm, but I deduct one star for the price.
