Soft handles, rounded tips, no exposed screws, Microban protection (I had never heard of that before). the handles are soft for little hands and big hands too and they fit little hands just perfect.they feel like they will last a while too, great price for these. The handles even fit my hands and I use them quite often! The handles have soft plastic with of bit of grip texture that prevents slipping when being used.With these scissors, we've cut paper, thin plastic, string, card stock, and so much more super easily!The stainless steel blades are rounded at the end to ensure safety when cutting. The handles are comfortable for child or adult, to the extent that if you have to cut fifty-eleven sheets of construction paper, your fingers won't wear out before you're done. The handles are also brightly colored, which appeals to the child in me as well as the children around me. The handles are, obviously, soft, making them easy to grip in little hands. The handles are also brightly colored, making them easier to find on the floor of a classroom or under a pile of papers. The handles are coated with a rubbery material that has built-in grooves to keep fingers from slipping. )The handles are slightly "rubbery" and the texture makes them easy to grip. I also love that the handles are antimicrobial so they are germ resistant, which in a classroom is fantastic because we all know kids don't have the best hygiene with hand washing. The handles are also "infused with "Microban" protection to "inhibit the growth of bacterial odors. They have soft handles and open and close easily. The handles are very comfortable, and it was nice that they accommodate both left- and right-handed users.As other reviewers pointed out, don't get excited about the &#34;storage rack&#34;.
