I put these markers out for my granddaughters birthday party along with a ton of t-shirts and let the kids use the sharpie brush tip fabric markers to decorate the t-shirts to take home as gifts. I couldn't resist giving these markers a try -- Lord knows I have enough regular Sharpie stains on some of my t-shirts! The markers slide fairly well across the fabric, if it's pulled tight (ours were banded onto heavy cardboard). Overall I REALLY like these markers! I am impressed and will definitely buy these markers again and recommend them!I love that the pack comes with all the colors you need to do pretty much ANY craft project! These are good fabric markers. These markers are nice for calligraphic drawing. Most fabric markers do not come with true flexible brush tips like these, which fine artists will love, but which may be wasted on very small children.The colors included are:- 3 "neon":  pink, orange, and yellow- 4 regular: green, blue, purple, and red- 1  black markerThe tones of the red, blue, and green markers are not as rich and pure as I would like, and the black could be stronger, but this is just me being picky, most kids would not notice. The markers were easy to hold and the colors applied boldly and sharply. These fabric markers are great fun -- bright colors, easy to use, and hopefully, fade-resistant. These aren't as precise as regular Sharpie markers, and because the stain is liquid, it does tend to run or bleed a bit. These magical markers had every color she needed and allowed her to easily design her masterpiece as the ink seamlessly flowed onto her canvas of creativity.Soon it was complete, they had crafted the best present for Grandma that anyone could imagine. I played with these markers a bit to get the feel for the Brush Tip... but couldn't write my review until I actually used them on something and washed it.So let's talk through the process. But the fabric markers were far easier to draw with. I like these markers because they have vibrant colors a good variety and the ink flows well and make your work of painting easy.I recommend it and definitely will buy these markers again, is a great add when you have kinds and need to do projects for the school, and you never know what will you need and these markers help a lot. These markers are great! The markers also work well on paper. We tried these markers on t-shirt material. These markers seemed simple enough to use and had a nice variety of colors. The markers were "brush like," which made for easy use. I think these markers would work best on "harder" fabric like tote bags, bandannas and sneakers. All in all, I thought the markers worked fine and would be great for decorating various items. I enjoyed using these markers; they gave good strong colors with little bleeding. These markers make it easier, but given the texture of your average cotton tee shirt, it takes a little practice to get the best results.On the very positive side, there was very little bleeding on a 100% cotton tee. Additionally, the markers kept going for quite some time, without drying up or running out of ink.As far as the performance in the long run, it is best to run your art project through the drier for 10 to 20 minutes at a higher setting before wearing or washing. Using the markers on a light fabric is a little difficult if you're going for detail. We used these markers to entertain some teenagers and gradeschoolers, making designs on t-shirts. With these new markers, the process was fun, because the round paint brush style nibs made them easy to handle, there was no bleeding on the canvas, and there was no mess to clean after we used them. Since the markers are stains, we could easily layer them, so the drawings look professional. These fabric markers are great identifying the grand kids things.And of course they're enjoying adding their own personal imprinton some of their cloths, the ones their allowed.I now can tell the difference between the kid's socks, that's a blessing in itself.Personally I'm benefiting with a non bleeding marker, that will resist fading.The uses are endless. I would highly recommend these fabric markers. The markers have bright colors reminiscent of highlighters. Some of the markers seemed to more readily release color than others. But, overall, these markers permit the creation of permanent design work on fabric. She commented that other markers she used either would not blend at all or the colors would bleed. These markers seem cool b/c they're designed to write on fabric and not wash off-however, most sharpies do this already anyway! I used these markers to mark canvas tote bags -- prior to finding these, I used regular Sharpies. These markers are somwhat fine tipped. The markers worked very well to fill in the spots, but I am waiting to see if the color will fade after multiple washings (as it has with regular Sharpie markers I used before hand). The markers stay within in the designated space without bleeding outward. Thus, these markers are excellent for creating designs on clothing.4. Permanent markers are permanent (duh! Even though these markers are specially designed for clothing they do not meet our expectations for quick, easy, no-fuss, results.The tips are a major bummer. The Sharpie is probably one of the most necessary , if not the most common, markers of its kind in IT and in ADMIN because of its utility and its quality.Used by anyone wanting to write on almost any surface for practical ( and mostly legal) reasons, the Sharpie pen is a CD and DVD creators best temp marker.It comes as no surprise then, that this pen is now available for use in the world of art in fabric and I would assume, many other types of Graphic arts areas.With the STAINED ability to supplement work on screen print and basic deisgn prints, you do anything from direct to fabric creations with plimsolls, and detailed work on shirts with advanced print designs that require a hands on approach if you want people to see you creating. I used these markers on some older table napkins I have that no longer "cut the mustard" as far as being blemish-free. The markers seemed to soak into the napkins quickly and the colors were very intense. These fabric markers are a lot of fun and they work very well. I used these markers on t-shirts, and after washing, the colors slightly fade but still show up well on the shirts.To understand how these markers will show up on fabric, imagine the shirt is a piece of paper and the marker is a crayon  Just like crayons, it is difficult to fill in a space on the shirt with a solid color without having some slightly white spaces between the brush marks. Also, these markers are not to be used on papers, etc. I haven't used fabric markers before or even regular Sharpies on fabric. The markers come in the basic primary color spectrum and are the same size as regular Sharpies. Writing with the markers was different from tie-dying, which is what we did last summer. These markers do a great job! She found that the markers are usable, but the way the tips are designed, it's hard to get the necessary degree of control. I brought out these markers one summer afternoon when we hosted a crafty playdate.
