So your printer can be in another room or across the room if you'd like it to be.As far as the ink goes, I love that you can buy just the color you need and not the whole color scheme every time because the ink colors are all individual cartridges. This printer is faster than any I Epson I have had and I have owned at least four others.The scanner quality is beyond anything you'll ever need unless you are an archivist and impressive. This is the fourth Epson printer I have tried and I have found all of them to print consistently well and be very easy to set up and use. Overall, this is an excellent printer of great quality and value. I first saw this printer from my Sister who had one and was really impressed on the quality of photographs when printed. Since I got the printer I have printed a 8&#34; X 10&#34; Picture and 4&#34; X 6&#34; Picture of myself and the quality is as good as if I went to a photo shop and had it made. Also being wireless makes this a wonderful printer for my use. I own the XP-310 Epson printer, not this model. The printer is also a back-loading printer and it's compact and folds up easily if you need the space.Of course neither the 2540 nor the 2530 can quite compete with my 845, but they are in their own class of printers. I would suppose it is set to medium as the printer is neither slow nor fast, but it's not a production printer either at about 6 pages per minute. We have only used the printer, the copier, and scanner functions and all have worked just fine. This compact printer is perfect for home and small office use. Overall I am pleased with this printer. ?That aside, you really can't go wrong with an Epson printer. I have a similar printer that I use in my small office. I am very pleased with my new Epson printer and would highly recommend it to anyone. This Epson WF-2540 is one great printer! I like this printer and the all-in-one features that are provided. And, to be honest, despite this printer holding less paper in its tray and having a smaller and non-touchscreen LCD screen than the WP-3540, I'm confident it could satisfy my business needs just as well as it does my household needs. I guess that helps keep the printer's footprint small, a distinct advantage, but doesn't allow you to perform large printing jobs.Cartridges are so expensive and printers so cheap, that they are almost disposable. This is an excellent printer for family use. I do Wish the LCD was able to tilt as if you need to place the printer more at eye level or above, it's very hard to see and read it as it is facing 45 degrees up.Comes with driver/scanner software CD but as of this date it needed updated on install and did that on it's own as it installed.Four ink cartridges all the same size, for myself, I like the black to be larger as that is what I use most, but....  Epson does make XL capacity replacements but for some reason they do not have them here are Amazon yet.I hope Amazon adds high capacity cartridges here at a good price soon.In the mean time, a nice deal on color three pack for standard capacity here however;Epson T200520 DURABrite Ultra Standard-Capacity Color Multipack Ink CartridgeSingle standard black here;Epson T200120 DURABrite Ultra Standard-Capacity Black Ink CartridgeONLY scanning item I was disapointed with was that when using the Epson scanning software, the "film" option is not available within the software as the scanner needs to have a film holder accessory plugged in (I read) and this unit does not work with that accessory. The Epson WF-2530 has been my best printer to date. Yet this little printer (which is incredibly small for an "all in one") has won my heart many times over! I use my printer for art project printing and I'm very pleased with the saturation of color as well as the fact that prints do not bleed, they dry almost instantly. This printer exceeded my expectations on the following counts:* Quality of prints for color, prints are sharp, saturated with accurate color & they do not smudge. I take my printer on the road and this one is very light & unobtrusive. I've decided to retire my NX430 and use this printer full time for all of my office needs. The printer finds your network, or it did mine, and printed right away from it. What I really liked about this printer is it fits under my desktop kiosk. I love this printer fax copier. You can scan from the printer to the phone, tablet, PC, email, online, file, pdf, image etc. I have selected to install the printer wirelessly and when the software asks to pick the printer to install it would suddenly stop working, and just crash each time. So now I had the printer on the network, but I was not capable of printing from my computer since it failed the Epson Net Config installation.Then I went to Start ->Devices & Printers -> and clicked on Add a Printer. It found the printer, and the installation went smoothly. The printer is on the network now.PrintingQuick and easy. This is certainly not unusual for a modern printer or scanner. At present, I have the printer at work in my office and don't want it on the network for all to use, so I did not test the wireless or the ability to print from my iPad...yet.The software installs with a disk and takes a while to load. I have another Epson printer we keep in my wife's office and it has a tray that isn't as easy to reload as I would like. I will probably sell that one too!If you need a printer to use mostly for photos, this probably won't be what you will need. You'll love this printer for the first few weeks... until you start running out of ink... and you always seem to be running out of ink. Only then will you get it.Contrary to what it may seem, ink for this printer is *not* cheap. I like my printer to shut the hell up until I need it. This printer is so far superior to my last one - a Hewlett Packard ink guzzler that printed smudgy envelopes - that I am very pleased to have it.I only encountered one problem setting it up. and would recommend this printer to anyone. I love this printer. I found the printer quite easy to set up and love the quality of the printed pages. It does print quickly much better than my old printer. That being said, the printer does what the company claims and it makes fine copies, prints, scans, etc... This is a good printer that prints, faxes, scans, copies and has Wifi and Ethernet capabilities. I bought this to replace a Kodak printer I've used for the past couple of years. This printer has many fine features: copies, scans, faxes. I often use my printer as a copier, and in this area the Epson really shines because it has so many settings to control how light or dark you would like the copy to be. My last printer, an HP, only had three dark/light settings, not enough to enable me to copy sheets that have a color background without using up a lot of ink. I generally keep the printer on the lightest ink setting, and it uses that for both copying and printing. (If you leave the printer on its lightest ink setting and then print in Word's draft mode the result will be almost too light to read.) The Epson WF-2540 is a good, but not great printer. This is a loud printer and it is pretty slow. This printer is a good value as it has many capabilities, but it is somewhat slow and noisy and paper feed at the back (from top down) is not ideal. This Epson printer was unpacked about an hour ago. This is a very good, multi-purpose printer, copier, scanner and fax machine. I decided to install the printer as a network printer (wired, not WiFi). The printer was instantly recognized when I connected it to my switch/router.One of my primary complaints about the Artisan 800 is the ink. I was pleasantly surprised to find this printer "Cloud Enabled," so setting up Google Cloud Print was a breeze. Compared to my Brother printer, this was almost silent! Now on to the bad...I don't understand why printer manufacturers continue to design printers that feed paper from a near vertical output tray on the back of the unit. I've had the printer for a little over a week. Using this printer on a regular basis could get quite expensive.This would be a solid four-star printer if it weren't for the build quality. It could be a much better printer if it were made better.I will, of course, update this review should any long term use issues arise. Perfect for the "upstairs printer"! I set this printer up and as soon as I went to use it, there was a loud beeping sound and the words &#34;scanner error&#34; appeared on the screen. This 4 in 1 Epson printer was easy to set up. This is a good printer... but the area where it is placed in my computer desk... (on a sliding shelf under the desk) makes it difficult to have the paper loaded from the back. My other printer was a front loader of paper to be printed and would return the printed page front too... I can recommend this printer to anyone who has optional storage placement for their printer. If you are looking for a printer that takes up little space, provides lots of options, performs well and is priced around $100, this one is an excellent choice. I got this printer as my other multi-function from Epson did not have sheet feeder, a really useful feature to have on your printer/scanner versus having to do one-by-one with a flatbed.I didn't have any problems at all with either my iMac or MacBook connecting to the printer or scanner. My other multi-function printer with sheet feeder was quite a bit larger than this printer. I can live with it, but a faster printer of the same size would garner the full 5-stars from me. I just set this printer up today, and I like the attention to detail from Epson. I'm hoping that this printer will have much better longevity than the Artisan, but at less than half the price, it's worth a shot. The printer took the odd media flawlessly, and the print was excellent.In other tests, I found the printer to be surprisingly good. The printer starts quickly and is fairly speedy in printing text. Easy to set up but the printer is too slow for my needs and the scanner glass cover does not stay open on its own. I purchased this printer for my girlfriend after having had good experience with the more expensive Epson Artisan 837 printer. So far the printer has worked well. It's about as big as my old printer and sits in the spot designated for it. If you plan to do the same, make sure you've got a USB printer cord because they do not ship one in the box. This is a remarkably light easy to carry printer, fits snugly without taking up much room. The Epson WorkForce WF-2540 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer, Copier, Scanner ADF, Fax is an easy to use, easy to set up printer that can handle all you home office needs. This printer was easy to set up, even I did it very quickly. Thats what I want from a printer. I was very excited when I got this printer. I was shocked at how quickly this printer went through ink. This printer is a great value for the money. It is the fastest printer I have ever used, at work or at home. I bought this printer to provide AirPrint capability for my iPhone and iPad, but I have been pleasantly impressed with how easy it was to set up, the number of additional features (scanner, fax), and the print quality. The printer is cheap but the ink will eat you alive. It works fairly quickly for a small printer yet does everything the larger types do - prints, scans, faxes, and copies. Finally, the printer also includes AirPrint, which means that you can print directly from your iPhone or iPad, which also works as expected.Driver and Installation (Mac) -- I always skip using the CD that comes with the printer because 9/10 of the time it's out-of-date, and this was no exception.

Setup was easy, though if you know what you're doing, I recommend connecting the printer to your wireless network BEFORE you install the software on CD to your PC - you can then just say "printer is already on network" when prompted during installation.

On printer controls are well laid out easy to understand and operate.I have not yet tested the printer's fax or wireless printing capabilities.Printing -Text print quality is good.

The printer is... not super noisy but not quiet.
