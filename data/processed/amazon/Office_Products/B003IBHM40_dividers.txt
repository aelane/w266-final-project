The Wilson Jones dividers are durable, sturdy but somewhat expensive. These sturdy dividers feature perky patterns that will enliven any binder. These dividers are fun. The dividers are nicely done with various pink/brown/green designs. These dividers are much more expensive than traditional dividers. If I needed dividers for everyday use, I would not be willing to pay the extra premium for them, even though they are thicker and more durable than most dividers I&#8217;ve used. These dividers go well together, but are each very different. All five dividers have different prints on them. These dividers are absolutely AWESOME!!! These dividers are so pretty. I am using them as dividers for my recipe binder. These dividers are lovely! But these five dividers do not show a speck of white and the white labels look out of place on them. When one is finished using these dividers, instead of throwing them away, they can be cut using various scrapbooking dies. As it is, these dividers would be good for home use, in a binder that doesn't get a lot of use, but it wouldn't work especially well for a student. Five 3-hole punched reversible dividers These dividers definitely have a &#34;recycled,&#34; somewhat muted look to them, but they are still really cute--way more attractive and unique than the standard tan dividers with plastic tabs.I love all of the designs, and, though the dividers don't feel as durable as, say, plastic dividers, these are still thick enough to make me believe they will last a while. These dividers add a bit of spunk to my otherwise boring white 3 ring binder. You receive 5 dividers in a pack, one side is printed, the other side is a solid color.All in all, much more fun than the cream colored heavy card stock like dividers you usually find, I'm not sure I'd run out and replace all of my dividers with these, but they are fun for certain projects, or for some types of 3 ring binder storage! I love these dividers. These dividers are made of  light cardstock and have an eclectic variety of cheerful colors and patterns on the obverse and solid colors on the reverse.The punched holes are not reinforced and the choice of an orangey red as an accent color for the two floral patterns and for one of the solid sides is somewhat jarring, but gives a contemporary and interesting effect.The fiber is made of a minimum of 40% pre- & post-consumer recycled content and the colors are printed with soy ink. These dividers are super cute with a nice assortment of Pink and Brown's.They are quite thick and sturdy and had no problem fitting into my 3 ring binder.I did find them quite difficult to write on with a pen, but a sharpie worked just fine! These are pretty little dividers for a binder. The dividers seem like they will last for a while and are really pretty colors and designs. These dividers are pretty awesome. These dividers are sturdy. The dividers come from recycled materials which is good.The dividers have a nice feel. These will not tear easily and should last long.These are fine dividers and certainly are  noticeable. These dividers, which represent poor value if what you look at is the number of items and the cost, are made from recycled materials to some extent. The dividers have a nice smooth finish and seem like they'd be sturdy enough for something which was not being accessed constantly. These five dividers allow you to organize a three-ring binder primarily by using the differences in the tab designs -- five of them because each divider is unique in style though pink and cream are the basic colors used there is also dark brown and olive green as well. But they are much prettier than any other dividers I have seen, I had to keep my teen from swiping them.A blank spot should have been left on the tabs for writing in your information.

You could conceivably write on these printed/colored dividers, but it would be really hard to read what you wrote, especially on the tabs that are solid dark brown.All that being said, there are some nice features.

These dividers have funky prints (polka dots and floral designs) on one side, but they are solid colored (pink, lime green, pale yellow, brown and red) on the other side.
