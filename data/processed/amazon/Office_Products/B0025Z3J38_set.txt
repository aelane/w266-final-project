It's a great set but wonder if it's worth the difference in price compared to Expo? This is a great set to go along with a new or existing dry-erase board. I'm not quite sure what else to add, this set does the job, is inexpensive, and of good quality. Good set. It's a great simple set for your frig, but I won't use them at school (I still substitute teach, so I use the Cadillac of the markers, the Foray write off dry erase marker. Within the set, there is a 1.68 ounce bottle of cleaner, an eraser, and four markers (black, blue, red, green). It is not the fanciest set imaginable, nor does it have to be.The markers don't have a strong smell and clean-up is easy enough. I have found this set to be very high quality. Complete set of dry-erase markers. Overall a great set. The Quartet 4-Count Broad Dry-Erase Marker Kit set is working out perfectly for my recently acquired white board in my home office. This set will keep your board looking white and clean. This is a great set if you need to replace all your markers, erasers, and cleaner at the same time.

Getting this with the set of markets should be part of any package.

The set includes four color chisel-tip dry-erase markers (black, blue, red, green), a board eraser and a 1.68oz spray bottle with a cleaning solution (that's the quantity written on the bottle and the packaging).

This is a good set if you need all the items included.
