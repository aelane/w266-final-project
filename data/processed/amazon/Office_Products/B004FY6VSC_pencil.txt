I recieved this pencil sharpener after my last 'cheapy' one from Staples died. This saves on unecessary pencil wear and keeps them around longer. This pencil sharpener is sleek, sturdy, and looks very nice sitting on a desk.We tested it out with some brand new pencils and are extremely impressed with how well it works. Once the pencil is sharp that's it, it turns off, won't run if the shaving catch compartment isn't on... and in my opinion, there's no risk of losing this sharpener! I'll check back in if I do.CONCLUSION:I've torn up many a pencil sharpener in my day, this one claims to last 6X longer which I hope it does (but 6 x longer than what exactly?) This is a high-quality pencil sharpener that seems built to last. When I say died, it sounded like it was grinding itself to bits everytime a pencil was inserted. I'm very pleased with this pencil sharpener. This is a fine electric pencil sharpener.As others have remarked, it is very quiet in operation.It gives you a nice sharp pencil point, and if I understand its operation correctly, it stops sharpening further once the point is sharp, although the motor continues to run.I also appreciate the vertical configuration of the sharpener, enabling a minimal footprint on a crowded desk.Others have complained that the shavings compartment could be larger, but this won't be a problem for a single user, or the "executive" for whom the unit is apparently designed. I thought this is quite expensive for a pencil sharpener and thought the reason for the price was due to it being "Quiet" compared to cheap ones. It is just as loud as any ordinary pencil sharpener that I was surprised they would advertise this as anything close to using the word "Quiet".The weight of this is rather on the heavy side, which can be good or bad, depending on how you look at it; I guess it is good so that it won't tip over or move around easily.Overall, I was expecting a real quiet pencil sharpener and was instead disappointed. I hope its the last pencil sharpener I'll ever need. This is the best pencil sharpener I've ever owned.

This would be my 3rd electric pencil sharpener.

It sharpens a new pencil in seconds.It still does that thing that electric pencil sharpeners do when they stop occasionally.

When the pencil is done sharpening, you know it.
