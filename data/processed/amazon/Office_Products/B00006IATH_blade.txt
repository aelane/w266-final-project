The blade is very, very sharp and had a hook to lock the blade when not in use. The blade appears to be quite sharp and produced a clean straight line, both on singles and several pages stacked, I have not tried thicker material yet. The blade is extremely sharp and the board is lightweight plastic. The blade does lock with a safety catch, but I wouldn't want this around kids. So you have a sharp blade but it doesn't make precise cuts.To make things a little worse, their guide lines are fairly fat, so you're not able to make a precise measurement, either.So I'm not sure where I'd recommend this. The blade is quiet sharp and I really like that you can lock it. This works so much better, and the blade seems to be quite sharp. Very sharp blade... cuts are very smooth and precise.

The blade is SUPER sharp (my bleeding knuckle assures you) and the cutter should only be used by adults.

I found the blade to be sharp and precise.

The blade is great and cuts very cleanly from top to bottom.
