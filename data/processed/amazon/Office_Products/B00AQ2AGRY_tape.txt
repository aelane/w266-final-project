But, most of all, this tape has great sticktuitiveness!! The Scotch Color Coding tape in red stands out brightly in any environment, so it is great to use to mark things (luggage, boxes, etc). It also is exceptional tape, to be used in putting together boxes and bundles. This tape is great. Scotch Color Coding tape 690, red, is an odd kind of tape. Masking tape, even the blue stuff, is much sticker. The tape is also extremely thin, about like scotch tape but perhaps even less. Masking tape is much thicker. Writing on the tape with an ink pen does leave a mark of sorts, but it wipes right off; thus, one cannot use an ink pen to write on this tape. After writing on the tape I waited about one minute and then tried to wipe it off. I think this tape needs a smooth nonporous surface to adhere. In short, this isn't packing tape. However once I started using the tape, this is probably the strongest tape I have ever used. Not with this tape as you will need a pair of scissors to make that cut. It was a strong tape, but it did not reach the level of Gorilla tape. I was surprised at how thin this tape was. I was expecting it to be more like a vinyl tape or a duct tape, but the thickness was more like clear packing tape, but a little different. It's a thin, rubber-coated tape that sticks to most flat, dry surfaces. This tape is for specialty uses, and one usually doesn't know in advance how they will use a super tape. This would be a useful tape on glass surfaces where the bright red color would serve it's purpose. I had a yellow tape that is very similar to this tape so I used both to package alike items in our basement. Love this tape for many uses. It sticks like the very best tape you every used. My tape came from amazon and you can get yours there as well. Who needs more red tape in his life? I thought we were trying to cut through all the red tape. The tape is fairly thin and the adhesive is fairly weak, so I wouldn't necessarily use it for repairs. It looks like 3M has a tape for every odd little problem or need and I really have come to appreciate them.FEATURES:&#9658;  Multiple tape colors designed for differentiation, long aging, moisture and chemical resistant for packaging, color coding or temporary holding applications.&#9658;  Multiple colors for packaging applications.&#9658;  Adheres to wide variety of surfaces.SPECS:~&#9658;  Adhesive Type:  Natural Rubber~&#9658;  Backing Material:  UPVC Film~&#9658;  Backing Thickness:  1.5 mil~&#9658;  Breaking Strength:  45 Percent~&#9658;  Core Size:  3 Inch~&#9658;  Elongation:  45 Percent~&#9658;  Industries:  Medical, General Industrial, Retail, Electronics, Food and Beverage, Consumer Goods~&#9658;  Length (Metric):  66 m~&#9658;  Tensile Strength lb/in (N/100 mm):  35 (613)~&#9658;  Thickness:  2.3 mil~&#9658;  Thickness (Metric):  0.05 mm~&#9658;  Total Thickness:  2.3 mil A neon orange-red, this tape is thick enough that it does not require a tape dispenser (you can simply run your finger over the roll, find the seam, and pull ... and since it is thick and plastic, it does not tear). The  tape did not shrink. It is handy and the tape wears well. The Scotch tape does not have perforations to assist with tearing as some duct tapes do, but it still tears just as easily as good packing tape if you use your teeth to get it started.I put the water-resistant claim to the test by filling a plastic jar with water and taping the opening closed with two strips of overlapping tape. The tape was only stuck to the circular rim of the jar and not the sides. Although the Scott tape doesn't feel any stickier than the packing tape, it did indeed do a better job of holding the water in. Otherwise, this Scotch tape seems to work well. The tape is very bright red, and it is white on the other side. I used this tape to mark our garbage cans as they kept getting confused with the neighbors' cans. The tape is very thick and very easy to dispense. A tape specifically intended for color coding (and at this price) should stick better on items that are seeing a lot of use. I decided to use this tape on just my stuff so then I did not have to label the boxes-my wifes, kids, etc...it being a very distinctive color. Just as advertised, the tape is strong, sicks to various surfaces, and works great for labeling things as much as for holding things together. The tape sticks to surface very well, even if the surface is porous. the tape is strong and is perfect for making which box belongs to whom. This tape has a UPVC film backing. Interesting, I think.This tape kind of does the same kind of jobs that duct tape does, but it is way thinner, doesn't stretch, doesn't leave white goo behind, and is easier to remove (from solid or non-porous materials). Not only does this tape come in other colors, it also comes in other widths. We were able to use the Scotch Coding Red tape to secure up some luggage that was falling apart. Nevertheless, the tape works incredibly well. Typically we buy/use 3M tape and adhesive products so I wasn't sure what to expect from this however, I'm pleased to report that the quality is quite competitive to 3M. I expected this to be thicker, like electrical tape, but it's not-- it's just wider and slightly thicker than the regular ole' Scotch tape we all know and love.I was most interested in this for packaging-- it's a fun and festive way to jazz up a cardboard box for mailing. The tape stayed put. When I fist saw this tape, I wondered if it was like masking tape (Painters tape) or duct tape. If you try to tear it, it will stretch and ultimately snap -like electrical tape. This is a very multipurpose tape that has a plastic like feel to it. I am happy with this tape. This tape went down very easily onto my smooth concrete floor. The tape is very forgiving- I was able to peel it back up without losing stickiness.This tape is orange with a bit of a reddish hue. Previous to requesting this tape to review through Vine, my experience of tapes had been limited to duct tape, transparent adhesive tape, and packing tape of various thicknesses and strength. I had never before encountered a vinyl tape like this one.I requested the color red, and it is a bright, clear, very attractive red.According to the Scotch website, this tape is made of uPVC with a rubber resin adhesive. When I put this tape right under my nose, unlike for PVC products, I barely smell it, and what I do smell doesn't bother me.A resin adhesive such as this tape uses is very durable and strong. This is interesting tape, not just because of the color, but also the texture. The tape has a decent stickiness, but is not meant to supplant packaging tape.I really don't know what else to say about a roll of tape, but I found this a useful addition for my workplace (although I can't think of a practical reason I would have used it at home). This tape sticks so good it stays stuck to itself. If you don't want this tape EVER coming off then it's OK and as long as you follow the above precautions. I have used this tape to repair a resin chair which was cracked when I bought it, but I knew it was the l last one in this color I wanted so I didn't carry it back. This tape is very strong and easy to mold, and fixed the chair great so it is both safe and sturdy again.I also have used it to put up some LED lights onto a wood handrail. The tape's adhesive is not very strong, but good enough for smooth surfaces since the tape is very lightweight. I also used the tape on plastic construction bags that were wet from a recent rain and the hold was secure. This tape is excellent and will be at the top of my list when I need something.I used it recently to mark a board on the deck for a repair crew coming out. I like this tape because it is light weight but very strong. I need a tape like this to reinforce the top of a fertigator device that I produce to keep it from cracking. This is a great tape product to use for labeling tools, boxes, shelves, or whatever you need to label. I have mostly used electrical tape, in the past, but I like this tape better. This is a more traditional tape, albeit a very premium one, that works as an adhesive as well as for marking. This thin tape is lightweight but sturdy, sitting nearly flush with the surface it's applied to. This tape is bright, colorful and strong. This Scotch Color Coding tape is some of the most expense and impressive tape I&#8217;ve ever used. The tape is thick and extremely durable under tough conditions. The tape sticks to every surface I tested it on. This tape is strong, very strong. tape I saw, so if you need a wide tape, this is the one.Overall, this is a useful tape whether for marking things around the house or for taping or labeling moving boxes. For all these uses the tape works beautifully.Time will tell on how the wear life of this tape will be. I used a tape dispenser, but the ragged edges don't stick that well - the saw edge on the dispenser strips away the adhesive (but it's an old blade and dispenser.) This tape is very good quality - firm adhesion and will not come off or tear easily.But it is expensive - and for color coding my bag, even a colored ribbon will serve the purpose. I have used this tape to seal boxes as well as to mark spots on my house that needed repairs.The tape holds well and is easy to cut. This tape is bright. This tape was great for marking the areas after I inspected my house so I would come back and fix them.The tape holds well but is easy to remove. I love when I find a tape that will actually firmly stick, and I did with this one. I am usually replacing tape every week or so. This tape had no problem sticking where I put it and I didn't have to use a ton of it. I like this tape and will definitely look into purchasing it. Like all of the other vinyl tape we've used this didn't pull of pieces of paint or anything else once applied but I can't say what it might do years from now if it is removed. This tape is very bright and sticks fairly well. I tested this by writing on the tape, leaving it to dry, and then wiping it with a paper towel. Writing on the tape with a Sharpie should be absolutely fine for indoor uses and the writing should stay on pretty well.I think that the price is a bit high, as there are other tapes that you can buy, but this one certainly seems like it will be a good choice for many people. This tape is much wider than the 3M coding tape and it doesn't stretch quite as easily. Now I'm thinking maybe I'll use this tape for a chevron design. I wrapped the tape around the top of the bottles and was able to use a hair dryer on high (this is a very hot hair dryer) to shrink the tape around the bottle lid. Because it is tape, I could tape it around the bottle and then heat it up to shrink. The 3M tape is a heavy duty plastic tape with a rubber resin adhesive.

The tape was still on the glass!

You tend to think tape is tape.

The tape adhered to the glass in spite of the condensation.
