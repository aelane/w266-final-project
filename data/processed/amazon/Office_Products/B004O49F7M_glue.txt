I've tried the hot glue gun but that hold didn't last long enough and the rubber would always separate from the fabric of the shoe.With Scotch's SUPER GLUE, I'll probably get another 4-years of wear out of my Converse. When I first got the glue I thought I got the wrong thing. When I started using it I realized I did get what I expected... super glue but with a different kind of dispenser; a much better dispenser. The glue worked very well and the pill box survived being put in luggage and handled by airlines.I highly recommend this glue. This glue works really well. and that's if you get to unclog, only to discover that the glue inside the container has dried out anyway, thus making the super glue a one-time use product. The glue is a very watery type of glue. I am not going to talk about the glue itself, most have used "Super Glue" and know what it is like. The glue itself is your typical superglue, but I found that it worked quite well on the first project I needed it for (re-attaching the leather lining that was coming loose inside one of my shoes). I now realize that I will need to be more selective about how I use this glue in the future. Finally an instant glue that delivers on its promises. I thought this would be just another super glue type product that makes claims that never materialize. It's the only instant glue I will buy from now on. The glue worked just fine. This glue works great. I tried the "white" glue but it made it bumpy. This is a nice, lightly viscous glue that does a pretty good job of staying put (vs the old school watery version), though it will run a bit on vertical surfaces if you don't bond it immediately. If you're like me and you always end up with super glue all over your fingers somehow, you'll appreciate the applicator, which gives you dropper control instead of the little metal tubes, which even with the gel type mix still always end up as much on me as what I'm trying to glue.But the biggest benefit to me was that with the bottle stored upright, the glue stays liquid and clog free. I actually managed to not get super glue on myself this time. However, be careful...if you squeeze too hard, the glue comes out really fast.Also, I found...like other super glue...I had to apply it several times to get broken pieces to dry and stick together for good. I love this super glue. ), and while that glue is still holding too, that brand was messier in terms of application. It is an excellent glue that bonds well, but more importantly, the applicator lets you apply a drop of glue cleanly and precisely and does not clog up after a few uses the way standard tubes of glue seem to. Secondly, they are extremely volatile, which makes them quick-setting, but also means the glue tube often dries up before you need to use it again. If you've ever gotten super glue on your fingers, or messed up a project because the super glue tube applied much more glue than you anticipated, then you'll appreciate the Scotch Super Glue Precision Applicator. The glue itself is typical, average super glue. This glue, so far, does what it says. It gets the glue exactly where you need it and not where you don't. You can see the glue approaching the tip, something which is advantageous when working with small parts.The glue adheres quickly and strongly. Once hardened, the glue will hold up well against a force that is perpendicular to the plane along which the glue is adhering. So as with any glue, there are limitations and the trick is to figure out what situations work well before using the product.In a month of using the glue, from time to time, the applicator hasn't needed to be cleaned and the glue still runs smoothly. In the past, I've only needed super glue maybe once or twice a year, so getting the glue flowing again was always a pain because the tip would dry out--not so with the Scotch.The first time I used it was when my daughter broke a figurine that she'd gotten just the day before. When I went to use the Scotch Super Glue, the glue flowed out as well as the first time.The Scotch Super Glue liquid is reasonably priced, bonds well to the supported materials, and is easy to apply. That's pretty much all you can ask for in a super glue. This super glue comes in a a nice solid container, with easy control of the glue flow. I have always been hesitant to use super glue because it always seems hard to control where the glue ended up and super glue on your fingers is not pleasant. Good and effective glue in a great applicator. I bought this super glue because it was cheap and I saw some nice reviews and needed to glue together a ping pong paddle handle because it split. It wasn't.I needed to apply the glue on portions of the rims on the bottom of the pots, then apply the felt pads. You control how much glue is dispensed by pressing the sides of the container. The glue comes out evenly. As far as the glue itself, it performs as described and has held up well. )The glue leaked out the side of the bottle... around one of the seams of the magic "button" on both sides that gives you that precision one drop at a time. However, as with all super glue type products, if you leave it for long, that's all she wrote. With super glue you definitely want to avoid it spilling over and getting on your hands. The glue is about as "super" as any other I have tried, and I can vouch for it working on ceramic and plastic. This is the first super glue we have ever used that we have had absolutely NO problems with. We have been able to use other glue products only once or twice. I still recall the first so called silly glue or crazy glue or whatever it was called. The glue really does come out one drop at a time as easily as an eye dropper works, and you can shut off the flow and cap it as easily as anything else. The actual glue is comparable to every other name-brand super glue/Krazy glue out there, which is to say it's pretty darn good. So far, this glue has held together the plastic circle, which operates under some stress. The glue dried very quickly. The glue took hold quickly, and it seems to be holding well (three days later). This is SO much easier to use than any other super glue tube/bottle/whatever that I've had before. I believe this is the first super glue I've ever used that actually stopped coming out of the container when I stopped squeezing it. This is the only super glue I'll be buying in the future. It's super glue, for this kind of stuff it's a near miracle.However, I originally had this in mind for a bit of microwave oven exterior plastic trim  -- no real exposure to interior-of-oven heat or moisture, but plenty of incidental heat and moisture from the range below. With this glue, an annotation to the statement that it is usable on "some plastics" goes as follows:  "Not suitable for polystyrene foam, foam rubber, polyethylene and polypropylene. What sets this super glue above the rest is the design of the dispenser. I really like this glue for its container!The packaging makes a lot more sense other "super glue".It has a no-mess applicator - which means PRECISION!You can drop the exact amount you need with this bottle.Yes, the glue is super watery and runny, however the bottle allows you to totally control how much you apply.It is also "no clog"!!! !This glue may be the exact same as any other glue, but it is DEFINITELY the applicator packaging that makes the difference between gluing myself, or gluing the broken item.My broken items are the happy recipients of the glue, and my fingers still have their fingerprints! I have used this glue about three times in the last six months. I love super glue and Scotch has just made it better. This glue is great. I've used this glue on several surfaces with great results, including plastic to plastic and metal to metal. It always seems to me that the glue either comes out too quickly or comes out in a "blob" (scientific term, I assure you). The glue doesn't leak out on you and how many time have you went back to an old tube to find it dried up? It is close, but it is still the wonderful super glue liquid we all know and love - it spreads a bit.I really like the design of the bottle though. Super glue vendors always have to make a choice between strength and reusability. The glue works as well as similar products.What is special is the no clog design of the applicator bottle.I've used it a few times and so far so good. I can HOPE that the glue hasn't hardened when I need it the second time, but certainly can't count on it. I love this glue. I do like this - this is super glue in a very small package. The glue is clear and very strong. So, the glue itself, I give a B+, identical to Crazy Glue. This super glue from Scotch is as effective as the original Super Glue. I like the glue top. This glue works great and is worth getting... But, as of now, the glue of choice has been the Loctite brand; their long necked bottle seems to be the first plastic one I have found that is reliably there when I need it. "Most super glue dispensers are essentially one-hit wonders. I then applied the glue to a random piece of junk mail, and stuck another piece of junk mail to it. It's super glue. This is a great adhesive, dispenses the glue? The glue works as well as any other super glue. But it's SO much easier to be able to apply the glue with a tiny precision applicator, and then to seal the bottle, and not have it glue itself shut. Much easier to apply than the normal super glue. The glue is a little runny so be careful there. Super glue is like one of those cool products brought to us by aliens in the movie "Men in Black"--you know like microwave ovens and velcro, but applying the stuff is always difficult. The glue and applicator work quite well.Seaming different materials with this glue bonds really well. Leaking glue can become a problem, the glue itself is just like any other super glue but to have a cap that is this faulty is dangerous.I am sorry, but the selling feature for this item is supposed to be the revolutionary Precision Applicator that does not leak or stick. This is not a glue for children.!
