Good scanner but not great. Very good portable scanner. I think that having a portable scanner is becoming more important than having a large scanner/copier/fax machine. Instead, I thought I'd compare this scanner, (the scan-tini) to the magic wand hand scannerVuPoint Solutions Magic Wand Portable Scanner (PDS-ST410-VP)as well as to your basic, all-in-one printer based scanner, AND to the scanner application on my android phone (yep - they have them and they work pretty decent..). For this, the scanner works great. ***Scan-tini scanner: This is significantly  bigger than the magic wand - you wouldn't be able to stuff it into your purse as easily as the wand scanner. To be honest, this scanner - believe it or not - is the one I use most frequently when out and about or in a hurry now. can't take it with you if you need a scanner on the go.4. This is a solidly-made, high-quality scanner. However, this scanner redeems itself with its excellent performance, great software bundle and its file output options.For fastest performance you'll need to connect two USB cables between this scanner and your computer or buy an AC adapter (not included). This scanner's TWAIN driver enables you to scan directly into applications such as Acrobat, Photoshop, Photo-Paint and Picasa.This scanner actually scans both sides of the document at the same time instead of flipping and re-scanning pages as some other duplex scanners do. A clean scanner, no matter whose design, will always yield better results. I have owned this scanner for about a year and give it regular workouts. The scanner's page separator, for example, is rated for 10,000 pages before Canon recommends its replacement. I consider this scanner to be money well spent, and will now be getting back to my goal of eliminating the piles. This compact scanner is pretty handy.
