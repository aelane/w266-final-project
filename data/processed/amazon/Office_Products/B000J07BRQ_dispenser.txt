However, they have their own dispenser which is quite handy. Scotch Shipping Tape has a well-designed dispenser, which makes life ever so convenient! It comes with a handy dispenser and you can use the dispenser to directly seal boxes, or use it to cut the tape into desired length. The dispenser is easy to use - you can dispense tape, apply pressure to seal the box, and cut the tape in one smooth motion.2. The dispenser works well. The dispenser is rugged enough to last through the whole roll of tape and all six rolls of tape come with their own dedicated dispensers. The dispenser lacks the quality of the older ones. I even have a dispenser for those, but when boxing smaller boxes the large rolls and dispensers are awkward, slicing, and annoying. The dispenser is good, tape is thick and strong but the it does not stick very well. Perhaps a reusable dispenser would also be efficient for those who want smaller rolls.

This works better on the Scotch dispenser than on other brands I have experienced.

The dispenser works fine for dragging the tape across the top of a box, but all this extra plastic does seem wasteful, and the rolls with the dispensers are not very big.

You can reuse the dispenser.
