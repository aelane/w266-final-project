These are very nice pencils but they are a little pricey for what they are. The pencils are somewhat difficult to sharpen. If you love drawing and creating with colored pencils, don't miss out on this super set of Prismacolor 2428 Verithin Colored Art Woodcase Pencils! The Verithin Prismacolor pencils are meant to be used for outlining, detailing, etc., as stated in the title of my review. However, the Verithin Prismacolor pencils have a harder, thinner lead which sharpens to a nice point & helps me color teeny, tiny spaces. If you use colored pencils occasionally, and not for drawing purposes, you might want to tryCrayola 30ct Twistables Colored Pencilswhich hold a nice point & for me, are easier to hold because the pencil part is a bit bigger in diameter than a normal colored pencil. I like Verithin Prismacolor pencils, but for my purpose, I can save money buying the average colored pencil. I find these pencils to be great for outlining, or cutting in your different colors. The pencils I got, sharpen to a very long and pointed tip, and I have not had any problems with the lead / colored core breaking on me. I love Prismacolor colored pencils. If you use colored pencils to draw, these pencils should be part of what you must purchase.
