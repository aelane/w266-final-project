I also look forward to trying it out with my Epson printer as well. I had bought a new Canon MG6220 Pixma printer, when my old Canon died. The printer had come with a sample of this paper, and it worked fine, so I decided to get more. I have used HP Glossy Paper for Years, but with a new Canon printer, I decided to try the Canon Glossy Photo Paper in 8x10 format and then 4x6. We both absolutely love the printer (you can look for my review) but the thing we were most impressed with was its capabilities of printing photos.I've not had experiences with home photo printers in quite a long time. If you have a Canon printer, you can go no wrong. I figure Canon makes the printer, the ink, and the paper, so they MUST test all three of those together, and that combination should produce good results. I have a great Canon printer and in my opinion Canon papers seem to work the best. This is my 4th Canon printer over many years. But with this great printer which will do fantastic photos as well as documents, scans, and copies, it has been a wonderful experience so I no longer miss my old printer. I recently bought a Canon Pixma MX882 printer after milking just as many years as I possibly could out of my old HP that I loved.
