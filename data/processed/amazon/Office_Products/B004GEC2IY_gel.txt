I like gel pens when they work right. I have never had a gel pen that was retractable. What I enjoyed most was that even though it was a gel pen, the ink doesn't smudge - even when you first write it. Unlike some other gel pens I've had, it isn't "too wet" as it flows and I had no problem with smudging of any kind.I don't understand several comments about it being expensive. I assume it's  there to stop the gel from drying out. I don't normally buy gel pens because I don't like the way they write, but these aren't bad at all. I tried the Pilot G2 gel pens but they didn't glide well; I felt like I was scratching at my pages.With these, I was immensely pleased with how smooth the writing was. The gel ink is very close to black and the roller action leaves only the slightest variation in darkness across the width of the line. The gel ink flows smoothly from the first. Average gel pens have a tendency to quickly dry out and become unusable, but I've had these for the last two semesters in school and they've held up well.Sleek and sharp looking, you don't have to buy or carry around lame looking pens with these guys. And the gel ink flow is WONDERFUL... I am enjoying these BIC gel pens offered through the Amazon Vine program.

The BIC gel pens are about all I ever use.

I actually don't mind writing when I'm using the gel pens.

However, as with almost every gel pen I've tried, the ink smears--and being left-handed it is unavoidable for me to move over what I just wrote.
