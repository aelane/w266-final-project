If you really love a book, repair it with book tape instead of regular packing tape. I find it appropriate to compare this Scotch book tape to it. There were hardly any  bubble and wrinkle when I used it to repair an old book and the jacket of a two-volume book. Maybe the book tape is a bit more transparent. I was a book junkie who was somewhat financially hard-pressed, so most of the books I bought were old paperbacks from the used book store. If a book is worth keeping, it is worth buying Book Tape for repairs. This Scotch book tape addresses that need. However, the book tape being fairly costly on a per-inch basis, I wouldn't use it for much more than the intended purpose, which is repair and/or spine reinforcement on books. The first book I tried was at the top of my list for repair, as it had been badly placed during binding such that the glue was holding down parts of the first and last page of the book. This Scotch book tape pretty much does what is says, but do get it positioned right the first time or some minor collateral damage is likely to result.Buy a roll or two and keep the demise of analog at bay for a bit longer. Scotch book tape is clear, thick and very tough.I also reinforced a used paperback textbook that was splitting, no doubt, because some dope perspired all over the edge of the covers and/or had fun peeling them back. Scotch book Tape to the rescue: BETTER shape than when I bought it and with new, sharp corners on both covers. Generally when I think of book tape, I think of the thick, colored stuff that librarians use. I have relied heavily on Scotch acid free book tape for many years now and I heartily recommend it. If I suspect that a book is going to suffer unduly from normal, everyday use, I like to cover the spine in this tape to strengthen it.

This is a sturdy, easy to cut, book tape that has worked well on ripped pages and damaged spines of books in my collection.I have a large collection of books ranging from stuff that came out this year to books from the 1860's.

When I fix a book I try to use as little tape as possible.

But that was all that was available as far as I knew.As a book lover I'm delighted to have this tape made especially for books.
