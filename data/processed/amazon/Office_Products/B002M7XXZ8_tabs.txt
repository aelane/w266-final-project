The tabs pull off easily enough that you can to re-use them a few times. Plus, the tabs I bought were not very sturdy and wanted to rip right out of the notebook.My solution is Avery NoteTabs. These handy tabs are great for organizing your books, reports, or any other medium that will hold a tab for later quick reference. I love these tabs. I've labeled the tabs and I can locate the section I want easily with only one flip. I love these repositionable tabs for organizing. These little tabs are so neat, it's a wonder nobody ever thought of them before. Additionally, the tabs allow you to write on them so I remember why I bookmarked a particular page in a book.They are expensive however for what they do. These wonderful tabs are very versatile, long lasting and reusable.Being able to add markers or dividers to technical books is a huge time saver.Not having to search through the contents or index to find the most commonly sought areas of information saves a lot of valuable time.I've found them useful to mark favorite recipes in cookbooks too.This size provides a large enough writable space to add your own comments to the marker.Very useful to add notes when you have more information than provided on the page being tabbed or ingredient changes for recipes.Endless uses for these handy tabs.Think text books, cookbooks, phone books and any other type of reference material you might access on a regular basis.A very useful tool that doesn't cost much. These tabs are very convenient and very durable. The tabs themselves are coated in a little plastic, so they don't get bent. These tabs are perfect for finding stuff that is important. Having first used the smaller tabs, I was used to just flagging pages with little to no written notes due to the lack of space on the tab. These tabs also work well on the vinyl sleeves for my CD binders. These tabs don't bother it. These tabs are great! The tabs can be removed and reused. The tabs are transparent green and a yellow highlighter just does not show up on them. The tabs peel off easily and re-stick well. These tabs are great to mark readings in texts and also allow the teacher to make notes.This is a fantastic product. When I selected these tabs I was thinking they'd be perfect for me to label my lesson plans for a CCD class I teach. Prior to receiving these tabs I had been using either a post-it note or a paper clip to mark my place. After playing around with these tabs (I'm easily amused.) I discovered that I could use these sturdy little tabs to mark my place in the teacher's manual for my class and they could also serve a nice book mark for whatever book I'm currently engrossed in reading. I like these useful little tabs and I can see myself picking more of these up in the future. There's not a-lot more to say, the tabs stick well and apply easily. These cool green tabs are quite sturdy. They remind me of the indexing tabs I used to use on 3 ring school binders, except these are much higher quality. Most tabs are designed to be affixed permanently, so they cannot be easily be moved or removed without damaging the notebook in which they're used. These tabs affix firmly, but can be removed and moved if you don't do it too many times and the surface will accommodate most writing instruments. These little tabs are very handy. You can use them as tabs on dividers in a binders or on file folders; however, the best use is in books. The tabs allow for quick access to the bookmarked paged and the writing area is large enough for most written notes. The tabs are super sturdy -- a heavy-ish plastic, lightly colored, but still transparent. You can use them as tabs on dividers in a binder or for stand-out tabs on file folders or hanging files. But these little tabs are really useful. As soon as I received my Avery tabs I began by thinking where and how I can use them. I cut them smaller and made monthly tabs on my calendar. If you plan on reusing these tabs, I would recommend writing with erasable ink. The tabs on the top are very sturdy and have held up quite well to my throwing books in my bookbag, taking out, throwing in again...since it sticks out a little for you to find it, one would think it would easily get torn up...but these are surprisingly strong tabs. Like the Avery 2 X 1 1/2" tabs, these 3 X 3 1/2" tabs adhere well to paper and make fine dividers. These tabs have more writable surface than the smaller tabs. I also did not find these larger tabs as easy to remove from the paper as the smaller ones, especially to thinner paper such as notebook paper. The tabs make it very easy to find what you're looking for quickly. They are also quite durable--the tabs won't get too bent out of shape, unlike the usual sticky notes.The sticky is VERY sticky. These tabs are thick and sturdy, and big enough so you can clearly identify what is being marked. Otherwise, for primarily adding tabs, I would suggest the smaller sizes where you get more tabs in a pack for that purpose. The Note tabs felt like thin textured plastic sheets--flexible, but sturdy.I started off with a highlighter and it worked much better than I expected. The tabs are made out of vinyl and while stiff are slightly flexible. The tabs are lightly tinted green but it is very easy to read through. Because at 20 tabs for $12.80 they're a bit steep in price (unless the boss is buying), and one has to take it on faith that with time their removal won't damage the page. These plastic tabs would be very useful for students, editors, cooks, or anyone else who needs to make temporary notes in books or other hardcopy, but does not want to write on the paper itself. I put these tabs through all kinds of tests to see how well they held up, and this is what I observed:1) You can see through them easily.2) Not only are they re-adjustable, but they don't leave a sticky residue, and they don't become loose over time.3) Regardless of types of ink and paper, the tabs did not mess up any of my written notes or my books' set print. I found these tabs especially helpful with our homeschool lessons/planning. The tabs themselves are nice and thick. These tabs are designed to be used as section dividers, not just as places to write a note. These tabs are like suped-up post-it notes.T
