It's fast and sharpens pencils of different sizes. We have tried it on Rose Art colored pencils and had no issues, we used it on regular number two pencils and had no issue, and the large pre-K Tigonderoga pencils and had no problems. (It's not the pencils, I used Dixon Ticonderoga primarily.) If you are looking to sharpen many pencils quickly, you'll be pleased with the X-ACTO SharpX Performance Electric Pencil Sharpener. ", or heed my warning about NOT trying to sharpen 4" pencils - which I'm sorry ... but I feel they have plenty of life left in them. I haven't honestly used them all because I use it mostly for pencils and colored pencils, and the unit seems to handle them fine. I hate trying to use freshly sharpened pencils, when it sharpens unevenly and you can only write at a certain angle in order to use it. It sharpens different sized pencils. Ever since I started using colored pencils as my main medium I have gone through several sharpeners. For completely unused new pencils it does take a bit more time; however, it is still faster than any other electric sharpener I have used.One note: the reason I want my students to be quick about sharpening is because (1) they disturb the class less when they are quick about it and, (2) I have had sharpeners burn out before and I want this sharpener to last a long time. It did not completely eat up my pencils as past models that I've used have. It sharpened my pencils in mere seconds. This helps keep the pencils steady so they sharpen evenly I presume.
