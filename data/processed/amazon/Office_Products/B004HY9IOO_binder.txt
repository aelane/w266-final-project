The binder itself is pretty.It contains both pre- and post-consumer recycled materials which is pretty cool.My only complaint is that when they were putting the cover over the underboard, something small was on the board and it's caused the cover to not be completely smooth. This is a very attractive binder - one that my daughter fell in love with, the moment she saw it. )Other than that, this is a fairly standard binder - with traditional, easy to open rings with a mechanism that uses a lever on each end of the spine. A one-inch binder is just about the right size for an entire year. This binder is nice because it's distinctive and therefore easily found/identified.All-in-all, I've been very happy with this binder. I choose this binder in order to create a stylish setting for my paperwork for my weekly office meetings. The binder is eye-catching and is normally the topic of discussion for at least the first five minutes of each meeting.It&#8217;s a great way to show up to a meeting organized. The binder fits in my tote bag perfectly.I also enjoy the look of the binder. This is a nice binder. The binder is made of recycled materials and printed with soy ink. The binder rings are attached to the back of the binder instead of the spine which I really like. The binder stays open easily when you lay it flat on a surface. The binder is functional and adorable. I really like this binder and I use it to hold the plastic pages I use for my grocery store coupons. I've been using this binder for a while now and it has held up well, is tight, sturdy and opens and closes cleanly. This binder is really cute...the front is pictured, the back is mostly brown with a little pink and green. Goes really well with the Wilson Jones binder dividers (more cute patterns). Otherwise, a really fun binder! This binder would only hold up to gentle use, definitely not for the backpack. Also the binder allows more pages than a regular one inch binder because of the design of the cover.Highly recommend this to anyone, especially for say a recipe collection, scrapbook, or home info etc. I was looking for a binder to hold some lists and this binder fits the bill perfectly. You might need a sturdier binder if you are looking for one for school and one that's going to be carried a lot in a backpack or briefcase. I got this binder to keep them all together so I can easily find what I'm looking for. I was surprised when I received this particular binder because it's not as flexible as most binders by this manufacturer. This binder is very sturdy and very colorful - inside and out. The three ring binder apparatus sits on the back cover so it will close absolutely flat, even when stuffed. This is the perfect binder for my kitchen. You would never know that this binder was made from recycled products; it is both beautiful and stylish. Inside the binder it is finished with a soft green color and pattern. It is a binder. If you need a binder, why not get a pretty one! This sturdy three-ring binder is a pretty addition to my office notebooks. This binder works about as well as one would expect in this price category. This binder has exactly one positive attribute.Pro:The one positive thing about it is that it is a recycled item.Cons:*  My first thought right out of the package was that it would have been better to not have any artwork. This binder feels very similar in construction to the Greenroom binders I've purchased at Target in the past. This binder is a good eco-friendly choice. I got the binder with the bird on it. The binder has one inch rings, and I plan to use it for an art journal. The binder feels like coated cardboard but looks as though it will hold up well. This Wilson Jones binder is made of 100% recycled materials (both pre- and post-consumer). This binder is attractive enough for a scrapbook, although I am using mine for my business records for this year and enjoy that the cover design is so bright and cheerful (as opposed to the big black binder I was using). This colorful binder is a welcome addition to my shelf, providing attractive relief from the plain ol' boring white ones. This is an adorable binder, made with recycled  products so it's Eco friendly and  lightweight.I plan to use it for recipes, and it will be a cute addition to the shelf. I received the binder with the two flowers on the front. I was really excited to get this binder which matches the Wilson Jones recycles Bliss blinder tabs (set of 5) that I had received previously. Love the binder tabs, but the binder was a bit of a disappointment. I appreciate that it's recycled but the binder was warped (curved outward) front and back. I would only buy a second binder if I could find one unbowed and sticker-free. I love this binder, it makes me feel like Spring when I look at it. This binder is a bit pricey for such a flimsy cardboard cover, but that's because it's made of recycled material. This binder is great! This is a pretty binder. The binder rings open easily. Interesting binder. While it will not be as long-lasting as a plastic-covered binder it is attractive, has nice hand feel, and I like the fact that it is recycled. Interestingly the binder hardware (rings) are located on the back of the binder rather than in the spine. That&#8217;s how I feel about this binder with its pretty pink flowers on a light green background; it is just darling! This is a very pretty binder. The binder itself feels like a laminated cardboard that is extremely think and steady. This binder has a cute print, but the mechanical operation of the three-rings and the quality of the materials feels cheap. This binder could look cute on a desk, big probably wouldn't survive being thrown in a book bag everyday. I just know she&#8217;ll love this binder when it&#8217;s time for her to use one for the first time. This three-ring binder is what you expect though in this case with a lovely natural colored design that you can see in the photos for the product. This is a very pretty binder that I have enjoyed seeing on my desk. This binder is made of 100% recycled content (including both pre- and post-consumer content) and is printed with soy inks. Overall I would say the binder is medium-duty; nicely made and good overall quality.This is made in China; I would have preferred made in USA in part to save on shipping fuels and emissions, which would have made this product even more eco-friendly. This is a 3-ring binder, notable only for the use of recycled materials and the rather cute cover pattern. It's a binder, not a tablet PC or some such- sure shouldn't be rocket science to make one. This means the binder doesn't fold shut- in fact, it's not even close, with about a 1&#34; gap when lying 'closed.'I
