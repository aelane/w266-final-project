The mouse pad looks "retro" in black/white. It also has a great stable mouse surface.Fellowes website lists this as being made of silicone, so I guess this is of the firm non gummy type. I hate the mouse pad itself, it is just a piece of plastic attached to the wrist rest and is much to smooth, my mouse doesn't seem to track right on it, I had to place my regular mouse pad on top of it so it would work. The mouse pad itself is slicker and harder than other mouse pads I have used and I really appreciate that and didn't even realize it was available to me until all of a sudden Fellowes delivers it in the I-Spire Series Wrist Rocker before I even knew that was what I was needing and wanting. This mouse pad is the perfect mouse pad I have ever used! Though I said it liberates the mouse, it is also slippery as heck. I prefer a mouse over the touchpad so rest my arm on the chair or couch's armrest and operate the mouse from there.I ordered the I-Sphire Series Wrist Rocker made by Fellowes because it looked like it would offer ergonomic protection and stave off possible carpel tunnel syndrome. The mouse pad part is very slick and at times makes it hard to scroll, so you have to pick up and reposition the mouse. If it was, I probably wouldn't accidentally fling my mouse over the edge when I'm pushing it away from me. I think I will eventually end up taking it off.The mouse pad surface, however, is excellent. The mouse slides across rapidly and I had to get used to that since I had previously used a textured mat. I use a Logitech corded optical mouse and it just glides over the surface. While it works, the mouse pad is not completely ideal since the fabric is the same as the mouse pad surface and extended use can get somewhat abrasive.This "wrist rocker" is the answer to all my complaints. So she uses it with her old mouse pad on top of it, because she does like the wrist rest. My Microsoft mouse has two long strips at top and bottom to slide on, and it feels fine to me.It's a little pricey for a mouse pad, but the wrist support is nice and comfortable. It does change how you use your mouse since the Wrist Rocker is up higher than the mouse pad part is, which is very thin.The part where you rest your wrist does seem to be comfortable. It's a mouse pad but with a flexible sort of silicone pillow in front that you rest your wrist on, there being some presumed health benefits to that. The new mouse I've been testing with has the usual Teflon feet. The mouse pad that I was using for the last 3 years was one that was given to me that a friend made for me with pictures of his kids on it which I loved. I can use my mouse for longer periods due to this wrist support.I am not sure what type if material is used for the wrist support portion of this but it is surprisingly soft in the center. It feels great.The mouse pad portion of this is on the thin side and does not have much texture to it. Ultimately my mouse works fine and for me the wrist portion is the key.I honestly am not crazy about the looks of this. This is much better.There is a mouse pad attached to the wrist rest as well. I thought it'd be nice to have a mouse pad with a more flexible and mobile wrist rest for my mouse hand.I don't find this mouse pad to be any more ergonomic than just other gel wrist rests next to a regular mouse pad.The silicon rest doesn't really move or roll - with the weight of my wrist (I am a 5'5 female, 115 pounds) it just stays there, pressed down a little. This is a ridged, flat and hard mouse pad with smooth contours, the spire is softer plastic molded just so, so one can rest and rock your wrist when using a cordless mouse.I did notice I became used to it very quickly and would hardly notice it's benefits --a good thing since it didn't interfere with the normal way I used the mouse, no adjustment.Though I didn't benefit from it much since most of the wear and tear on my wrists comes from typing.Still not a bad addition to an office and sleek looking also.
