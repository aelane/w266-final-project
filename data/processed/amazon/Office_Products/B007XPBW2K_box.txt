With a box this size, handles would definitely be handy. It's a box. A box is a box and when you've moved 7 times in 13 years like I have, it's a good idea to keep spare boxes around for when it's time to bug out. This box will easily allow you to pack even your largest dinner plates. If these were shipped in a sealed box the rain would have ran off the outer box protecting the contents inside. There also at least twice as strong as an average box, and very substantial in feel. So, for me when I requested it, I had anticipated loading the box and having someone else move it.Will it protect your items in transit? The box itself is very tough (double-walled will do that! I would not use these as a 'Dish box&#34; because they could be far too heavy to move if filled with dinnerware or small kitchen electrics. They come folded flat in an oblong box and must be folded into shape. I recommend this box highly! It would even make the box that much better. It is therefore one of the most important box sizes you'll use for an average house move. Because each box is so tall and kitchen stuff is relatively heavy, the boxes are difficult to lift and need to be moved around on dollies.I appreciated that there were four boxes in each set--plenty for a large kitchen's worth.

I'm not certain that calling these a "dish box" was the right way to advertise these.

Having said that, the box is a little too big to be packing dishes in and there's no handle for you to lift and carry the box.

This box is rated to hold over 100 pounds.
