This sharpener has been put to the test as it is being used in our school's library. But even if you don't need a multi-size sharpener, this unit will do the job for you. A "perfect" sharpener just shaves off a nice cone evenly all around, leaving about 0.2 to 0.25 inches of lead exposed, also in a nice cone. We have a sharpener without one and it's easy to overfill it and then you end up with a huge mess. It also keeps the sharpener safely in place while it's working. Before I ordered this sharpener I had three (yes...THREE)different brands in my studio. This X-ACTO sharpener makes number four. Therefore, having a sharpener with a dial that accomodates the various sizes is a definite plus. Overall, I highly recommend this sharpener. I have found that it takes a very well-designed and well-made sharpener to stand up to 2nd grade students. This sharpener seems to be a solid choice because it is a very fast sharpener. This sharpener is relegated to the ranks of LOSER along with the others I have had over the years that have all-too-quickly died. We have found this sharpener to be superior to all others we have owned over the years. The sharpener plugs into the wall and there is a little red light that will let you know when the waste compartment is full of shavings and needs to be emptied.

Or that X-ACTO makes a reasonably priced sharpener that allows moms to sleep in while their kids are tearing up the house.

The X-ACTO SharpX Electric Pencil Sharpener is a powerful sharpener intended to handle a lot of work--more an office or school machine than a home machine.

Only get this X-Acto sharpener if you are prepared to throw your pencil away at say the 4" mark (which IMO is a total waste).2.
