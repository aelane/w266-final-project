I connected this projector to my Ipad. And this projector is so small that it travels really well. It is very easy to use (as long as the projector is charged) it is a simple plug and play setup. I love that you can charge the projector to use for over two hours, or you can simply run it while plugged in for non-stop use. I love that I can easily place the projector in my computer bag. I highly recommend this projector. I have been wanting to get a mobile projector and was thrilled to get the opportunity to try the 3M MP300 Mobile Projector. I turned the projector on at 4pm in my living room which has a total of 5 windows that face North, East, and South. This is the best and most affordable projector I've owned to date. I highly recommend this projector for portability and picture quality. We have been wanting to have a projector for camping to watch movies, and this will do the trick. The projector immediately mirrored my laptop's display and adjusted the resolution to one ideal for the projector. Disconnecting the projector from the PC automatically returns the computer's resolution to your normal setting.I was also able to change the display to use an extended desktop view rather than mirroring my desktop so that I could show something different on the projector than I displayed on the laptop's monitor. The further back you move the projector, the larger the picture on the screen is.The projector also plays sound through its internal speaker. To accommodate this, 3M has built this projector with an audio out port so you can attach some better external speakers if you wish.The projector has a rechargeable battery, so you can use it without external power for a few hours - long enough to watch a movie or give most demos. This is a great projector that is easy to use (though a better startup guide would help).

I've been interested in a small projector for both personal and business reasons.

Having a small portable projector is ideal for those times when I accompany a salesperson to a customer's office to perform these demos.At home, I wanted a projector to more comfortably view movies and shows streamed to my PC via HBO Go, Amazon Prime Streaming, etc.

The projector comes with a standard HDMI cable, which I connected to the HDMI port on my laptop, then turned the projector on.
