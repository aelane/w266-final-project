this product works well. This product is supposed to be permanent, so there is no guarantee it won't damage your walls. It is an excellent product that does exactly what it says. I used this product to hang large posters on my workplace walls for a party. Pretty much exactly what you're looking for from a product like this. All in all though a good product, I'll definately want to get some more. It's truly a a wonderful product, and great to have on hand. Excellent, effective, and easy to use product! I have used this product in both in the tape and squares form for many years. This product is also useful for mounting on surfaces that cannot tolerate a nail or screw hole. It holds perfectly.I've used a similar Scotch product that was cut into 1" squares, and wouldn't be without it. This product is even better - because it comes on a roll, it stays cleaner and dispenses more easily.Yet another Scotch product that's an absolute must in my house. )This is just a product that serves its particular purpose perfectly! I received this product through the Vine program. Great product we used it mount all our travel photos above are bed. This product is excellent for mounting items. I originally thought to use this product just for scrapbooking and card making, to add dimension.
