The main thing I dislike is that the power plug does not fit tightly and unless one is very careful, it disconnects easily. It seems an easy, inexpensive thing that should have been included. The thing that really  puts this into the 5 star rating is the form factor. The impressive thing is that it has soooo many features for its price. The great thing about the XP400 is the cartridges are really affordable compared to most other printers. However, I quickly realized that AirPrint is pretty much the only truly good thing about this printer. The best thing is it's small footprint which makes it ideal for tight spaces.It took me about 15 minutes to properly setup the printer over my wireless network, configure Epson Connect, etc. I knew that the next thing to do was to go to Epson's web site and download an updated, Mountain Lion-friendly driver, and sure enough, Epson's website almost intuited that this was what I was looking for. The important thing to remember is that the photo paper and the quality of your camera will make a difference in results! The first thing you notice when taking the Epson out of the box is its compact size and light weight. One thing worth criticizing, and I've found this true among all of the Epson printer's I've used, is that the draft print mode is practically useless. The good thing is, you can change ink cartridges one by one (mine was heavy on the blue, so I only needed to change Cyan and Magenta first).
