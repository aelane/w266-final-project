The blade is very sharp and it feels like it will last a long time too. It has a scoring "blade" which is really nice for folding/creasing, or for just marking your cut to make sure it is exact. The blade certainly is sharp, but it's tiny and can bend if you touch it. This blade is useful for making nice crisp fold lines. I experimented and tried getting the blade unit off - it was a bit of a struggle, and I was a bit apprehensive that I was going to break the track on the slide bar before the blade came off. The scoring blade works nicely on both regular sheets as well as cardstock. I've used the scoring blade exactly 0 times so far, but the actual cutting blade is excellent. I do like how you just slide the blade across the guide to trim a nice straight line. This one works just fine, sharp blade for several weights of paper. The blade is offset on the cartridge, so it is necessary to be aware that the cut is made where the groove is on the right side of the trimmer.

Although they probably stay sharp longer than a normal blade, it's not nearly as long as I expected from the description.

I had to cut them off for future reference.- Sometimes the scoring blade cuts.

With this, I started with the cutting blade, slipped a piece of 20 pound paper in, and rolled the blade up to position it to start.And a strip of paper fell away.No pressure at all was required for a nice, clean cut.
