I swear I've used every tape out there to stick down all these &lt;expletive> rugs. great double sided sticky tape, used indoors on a wood floor to secure an area rug. If I need to remove the tape from the hardwood floor, I just use a hair dryer to heat the glue and remove the tape carefully.Ever try hanging plastic dust barriers before sanding walls during remodeling? This tape makes it so much easier. Again, heat the tape with a hair dryer and remove carefully to avoid damage to walls.There are many other uses and will be buying more soon. I found this tape while purchasing stair treads. Anyway, this tape made everything so perfect.It sticks to the back of the treads so well that I think they should sell it with the treads as a "set" deal.Now I don't have to worry about treads moving off the wood stairs, it made me feel much safer. From what I've read, the tape doesn't leave sticky residue on the carpet after removable, but I'll report on that later when the time comes. This tape is AWESOME---sticks to the mat and is pretty easy to pull off the 2nd side of the tape also. Good tape. The tape I received had only one side.I was disappointed and returned it which Amazon credited money back to my account.Amazon is great for backing the products sold on their site.I will try Home Depot next.
