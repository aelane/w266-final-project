I love that Sharpies are now available in fun, neon colors. All in all, all of these neon Sharpies are truly neon and bright (except the blue "neon" Sharpie). I prefer normal Sharpies to these, I find the normal ones much more useful than the neon Sharpies. I love me some Sharpies, and these are great! Sharpies are not just for marking boxes anymore! Sharpie Neon Fine Point Permanent Markers, 5 Colored Ink MarkersThese Sharpies are more for fun than serious things like labeling CDs or packages. We have Sharpies in almost every room in the house. These Sharpies will write on just about anything from paper to metal to sneakers. They're for your Inner Child.Okay, y'all know how much I love my Sharpies. I love Sharpies! Sharpies are AP certified, so they are nontoxic, as well as water, smear and fade-resistant. I love Sharpies! I love Sharpies for labeling things and especially writing on CDs I burn at home. These Neon Sharpies are all about fun.
