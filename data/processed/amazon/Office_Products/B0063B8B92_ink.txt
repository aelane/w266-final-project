The ink gets good reviews. I've not burned through the original ink cartridges so far - they seem to be holding up well.I like the USB interface capability, as I don't have wireless in the house. Curiously, the ink does seem to bond to the photo paper better than with the HP unit - in fact, some of the Epson prints look like professionally printed cards, but the colors being so off made about half of the prints unusable. I will not know how cost-efficient this one is until we run out of ink (as we have no estimate of how many pages it will print/ cartridge).All that said, my opinion of a printer is closely ties to the cost of ink, at least that goes to its utility. When I had initially run out of black ink, the printer would stop every time I tried to print and ask me if I wanted to go ahead and print with all colors. I ran out of colored ink and since this printer has no "use black ink only" setting, ("print in grayscale" setting still uses colored ink. When the ink gets here at the end of the week, I will see if I can make this printer work again. Got the compatible ink - emptied the black cartridge of incompatible ink and filled all cartridges with compatible ink. The ink was instantly dry, so there was no smudging. The ink cartridges seem reasonably priced for replacement, and for the color ones you replace only the color you need, not the whole thing.I don't know yet how long the cartridges last as I only just got it.Scanning and photocopying both seem very good.All in all, this is a good personal use printer, for a very reasonable price.I would recommend it! The ink is priced fairly decently. Then consider the ink replacements cost about as much or the same as the printer w/ ink so it's not worth it to me.Update: The power cord will not stay plugged in to the back. The ink cartridges and paper would require frequent replacement, and I don't think it would last very long with that kind of use. As of yet, I can't say that we use more ink, but I don't want to hear, "mom, we ran out of red ink" and then a week later, "We ran out of yellow ink". This avoids using all your ink when the spam faxes roll in as they do all the time.The footprint is not huge but not small either. Granted, I have to pay a little extra for ink but the convenience is worth it. Though, the more I think about it, Epson ink probably costs the same or maybe even a bit less because of the Kodak ink wasted on regular print head cleanings and test pages.I HIGHLY recommend.
