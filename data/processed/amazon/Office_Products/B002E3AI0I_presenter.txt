Not only does the presenter tuck inside it, the USB stick also conveniently tucks inside of the presenter. Kensington Wireless Presenter Pro with Green Laser PointerThe Kensington presenter remote installed and worked in a Windows 7 64-bit environment without any problems. I also have a Logitech R800 presenter that I've been using for over 2 years with great success, so I have a baseline to compare the Kensington.First, the Kensington isn't intended to be a top of the line "Cadillac" remote. All in all I find this presenter works just right for me and offers just the functionality I need. This presenter does exactly what it is intended to do, and does it very well. This presenter will last many, many presentations without skipping a beat. The presenter fir comfortably in my hand and had a green laser pointer, back and forward buttons for the slides, and black screen. What we liked about this wireless presenter:- fits nicely in the palm of your hand (works for both righties and lefties)- it does not generate a lot of heat if held for more than 45 minutes- the USB receiver (1GB memory stick) will pick up the presentation on your lap top and does not have to be a presentation stored on the stick- left/right buttons easy to use and the 'stop' button blanks the screen and press it again brings the presentation back in view- it comes with 2 AAA batteries (nice)- when finished, the usb receiver is easily stored in the body of the remote.- once the usb is in the body of the remote, the infrared light does not work - so there is no chance of the battery draining when stored in your bag (neat)- the infra red light projects a sharp image- remote definately works up to 25 feet away from the usb receiver- the actual product looks a lot nicer than the picture!The price was a little steep for other wireless presenters that have more features. This presenter with laser pointer and memory works as you would expect it to work. This turns on the presenter. The presenter also has next and previous buttons to advance to the next slide or go back to the previous slide whether you are in slideshow mode or not.A nice feature is the Black out, for when you want to temporarily black out your presentation.Since the Presenter doesn't use infrared to connect to the dongle, the line of sight from the presenter to the dongle does not have to be perfect.

It's a "presenter," but what actually does that mean?

This is a simple 3-in-1 presenter that just eliminates the clutter (but not the size) of the 3 most used presentation items (thumb drive, presenter, laser pointer).

I'd like to have understood more about this presenter before ordering it.Three stars.
