Currently, I have a small Sunbeam scale for weighing letters and small parcels (usually up to 4lbs) and a large scale for weighing large parcels (up to 50lbs). I've found this scale much superior to both for the following reasons:- Remote LCD display that won't be blocked by bulky parcels- LCD back lit display that can be read in low lighting- Fold out mailer holder to hold awkward shaped or sized parcels/letters- Large range (my large scale won't measure down to 0.1oz and my small scale won't hold large parcels)- Battery or cord (USB/outlet) powered (even comes with 4 free batteries)- Hold and tare functions are on remoteI received this as a review sample but I can say that as someone who uses postal scales a lot this is simply the best postal scale I've ever used. I have been testing this scale on and off throughout the week with my tried and true postal scale and I can report this scale is pretty darn accurate.The scale assembles quite quickly and offers two ways to power it. I like that this scale offers pop up stands to help you measure weight in a variety of directions. I love that the scale reading screen is backlit and that it can be placed in an easy to read location (i.e. What I like about this scale is you can power it up in three different ways. This Accuteck ShipPro digital scale works very well and is easy to use. We tested this scale with several weights that we have in the house and each time it read within a few tenths of an ounce of the other scales we have. Like any scale, this one works best when sitting on a hard surface like a counter-top, desk file cabinet, or a hardwood or tiled floor.If you would like to see pictures that we took of the scale in use, please go back to the scale's main sales page and scroll down to where the "Most Helpful Customer Reviews" section starts -- look to the right of that area for the "Product Images From Customers" section. I did receive this scale gratis from the manufacturer, and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed. This is a great little scale to have. When asked to review this scale, I almost declined because while I do mail a good number of packages for our business, most of them go US Priority Mail, so weight doesn't matter. The more I thought about though, the more I realized this scale would come in handy as more than a postage scale.The separate display and ability to choose between using battery (4 AAA) or outlet power make this thing very versatile. I have not yet calibrated my scale, but don't plan on it because it is already accurate enough that adjustment isn't necessary.
