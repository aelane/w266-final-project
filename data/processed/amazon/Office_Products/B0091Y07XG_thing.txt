One thing I've been trying to do the past couple of years is become "paperless." Not sure if this is just a Mac thing or what, but it seems odd. it seems like just another thing to go wrong. It seems like all of them do one thing well leaving something lacking. Another odd thing is that the output tray automatically pops out to hold the printed pages. The best thing is it's small footprint which makes it ideal for tight spaces.It took me about 15 minutes to properly setup the printer over my wireless network, configure Epson Connect, etc. One thing is the size - unlike the Artisan 837, the XP-800 is much more compact, but can do almost all of the same functions of the 837. Once thing I did notice though: the XP-800 is chewing through ink like crazy. The only thing we haven't had the need to use yet is the fax capability, although if/when we do need it, it's there.Overall we are very impressed and happy with this printer - it's great for any student or home office, anyone who does a lot (or even a little) printing in different capacities.

One thing it suggested us to do was to connect to a computer for initial setup, which I balked at.

You see that's the thing about a review.

The very first thing that I printed off was a two-page knitting pattern.
