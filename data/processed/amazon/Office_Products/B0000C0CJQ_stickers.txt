I used "Drawing" from OpenOffice to create my stickers, and it worked fine.It's a good concept, and cheap and easy way to organize your stuff in a funner way. The stickers are pretty sticky, but don't feel like they will permanently stick. I have been able to apply and remove stickers from plastic jars with ease.I recommend this kit if you are into crafts. stickers you see in grocery stores. We can make special stickers for my boys that combine their names and interests--very customized to them, which is a real treat for them. I am currently using these to make cute stickers for my homemade jams, jellies, vinegars, and limoncello to give as Christmas gifts. We needed to make stickers for various gifts and to stick to my wife's notebooks so we got this. I purchased these stickers to make labels that I cut out with a circle punch for tops of my paints and other things. I love stickers. I'm looking forward to doing more cheap,easily changeable stickers for electronics! Sometimes when we buy stickers, the ones we find in stores are not quite right - they may have a sports logo but it's either too big or too small, or an animal or image we're looking for isn't just right.
