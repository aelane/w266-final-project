The photo printing was, I admit, surprisingly slow. If you are looking for a true photo printer, this is not it, however, if you want a great overall color printer, at a very good price, look no further.You will not regret this purchase! But since this is not advertised as a photo printer, no points off for that.Here are the great features:* Wireless printing! I picked up some photo paper and am so happy with how well it turns out gorgeous prints. I was pleased to see it started printing a photo from my Android phone before the phone had finished sending the image. This is to be expected, as the Artisan was made and tailored more specifically toward photo fanatics. But, at least now I can go straight to a photo on my phone and send it to the email print address and watch it print right off on the printer without all the extra steps I would have otherwise had to take. If your printing a photo, depending on the size, its not as fast. Said glossy-paper photo prints have a slightly cool color temperature (and an ever-so-slightly pink bent) but show exceptional detail. If you primarily want to print photo lab quality prints, you will probably want to look at other printers specifically designed for that purpose. If you are looking for high-quality photo printing, this may not be the perfect machine for you.
