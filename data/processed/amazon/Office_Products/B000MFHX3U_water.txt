I did not need to use any water (although you can, the label says, if needed).The white side is for erasing, the blue side's just for gripping. when you add water, and you push down solidly, yes, it works extremely well -and I don't doubt it also works great for permanent markers.Is it any better than a standard magic eraser? Therefore, I decided to rinse it under water. They do require that you add some water which can be a bit inconvenient and was something that I had not anticipated. Add a little water, squeeze it through, and voila. All you have to do is add some water to the pad, squeeze out the excess water, and clean the whiteboard with it. You soak it in water (like a sponge) and then scrub the surface you're trying to clean. A little water and it will take everything off - though it will smear a bit if you're not careful. Apparently you can put some water on it to improve results. Adding water made it squeak but didn't do anything to remove the residual staining. (Minimal water cut through most of the dirty look but to get the deep stains required more water on the eraser.) They are also much easier to clean, as you simply run under water, rub off the marker and squeeze when finished cleaning.They are fairly light-weight, so if you have kids who constantly pass by your boards, a simple brush might send the eraser falling to the floor. It does recommend to use water if if a more troublesome mark is left behind but I had no need. I like that all I need to use is water instead of chemicals too. Try'em out and see for yourself.I'll recommend these --- and a little water helps get the old permanent markers off too. Obviously, they can be used with water and so gently rinsed out if you feel so inclined. It's best not to have much water so the amount of streaking is eliminated. With a little water, they work on that dried on ink, and on permanent marker.What could be better:- Mostly, these are pricey, especially compared to the alternatives. I have not tried the water method because I do not use permanent marker on my white board. While the plain water did get a small amount of the ghosting cleared, this was nothing to the cleaning ability of the 3M eraser. With just a little water, these pads cleaned better than the "whiteboard cleaner" spray cleaner we normally use. Interestingly, it lasts longer as it can easily be washed with water on the faucet as opposed to those heavier plastic felt bottom erasers. Then I added water as the instructions stated, and at first I made the pad too wet (we're talking the white magic eraser side) and all I got was a wet whiteboard with the stained writing remaining. So I squeezed out the excess water from the pad, dried the board and tried again. So I squeezed out more water and tried again. Strange and somewhat inconvenient to add water to a dry-erase eraser. A little water and some scrubbing and the board was like new. That with water will clean dry erase boards with some stubborn marks. I then put some water on the eraser and it removed the rest of the ink. Also, once you've used it with water, even after the eraser has dried, it's not nearly as easy to use anymore.

Run water on it.3.

3MWE has dried out, take it back to water faucet ..Let's see, assuming average industrial cost of a professional with overhead of $100 per hour, and we estimate the company has just spent about 25 bucks (not counting the paper towels, water and trash removal) to ERASE THE WHITEBOARD ..

So when I added water and I lightly brushed the board I was also a little disappointed that the ink really didn't come off very easily, like it might with spray and a towel.
