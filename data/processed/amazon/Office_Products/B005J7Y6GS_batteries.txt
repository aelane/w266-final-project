It even included the batteries! In short, alkaline batteries will last you well (but with regular & constant use you'll come out ahead using renewable batteries).PROS:Sturdy, Compact ConstructionEasy to Learn & to UseVersatile For Many Applications (including Business)Large Selection of Fonts, Sizes and StylesSpeciality Applications (e.g., Barcodes)Attractive & Easy to MaintainMaximizes Label UsageEnergy Efficient (and A/C adaptable)Bright, Backlit ScreenCONS:Lacks Helvetica and/or Arial FontsThe Epson LW-400 is easy to learn and to use, attractive and well designed, energy efficient, extremely versatile and very well constructed. That said, I use rechargeable Ni-MH batteries all over the house. You may also have to supply your own batteries. It runs on six AA batteries and can be used on your desk or in your hand.It is very easy to set up the first time. The LW-300 takes 6 AAA batteries while the LW-400 takes 6 AA batteries (batteries not included with either printer).Both of these printers offer 14 different fonts in 10 different styles and both have more than 300 special characters that can be printed. It uses 6 AA batteries and you can also get an AC adaptor. It requires six AA batteries to run, but as of yet I cannot comment on length of battery life with normal use. I just use the batteries and I haven't had to change them in the several months I have used the product. I was using a P-Touch before that was so pathetic it started complaining of low batteries after 2 labels, so this is a vast improvement. And the batteries last a long time, too! Set up was easy and fast, only requiring putting in the 6 AA batteries and the inserting the labels.

The batteries are in the same area so they are replaced the same way.

The Brother's batteries are in back also, but the cartridge is inserted by lifting an access flap on top.

You turn it on (powered by 6 AA batteries) and the screen lights up.
