You can cut wrapping paper, posters, advertising, coupons . Cutting wrapping paper of a medium thickness is just about all it's good for, so from my perspective, it's just not really worth the drawer space it takes up. I started on the Scissor Mouse cutting paper on my craft table. If the paper was too thin, I noticed it started to rip instead of cutting. The Scissor Mouse works great when you are using it on standard paper with a clear edge on a hard surface. The paper bunches up under the red guide and makes quite a mess. Wrapping paper is a breeze to slice to size at home.Once the limitations of this tool are realized, it becomes a great tool for little ones to use. Thicker paper would not serve the purpose this cutter is made for, ease in cutting with little to no pressure on the hands and fingers.This great little invention has rollers on the bottom so it does not harm the cutting surface of your choice, and this does need to use this on a surface.I can absoutely for sure see this cutter saving a huge amount of time with cutting wrapping paper, for me that alone makes it worth the money, to me the worst part of wrapping presents is cutting those long cuts, I am actually looking forward to wrapping my next presents.Easier on the back because I will be able to pull the paper closer to me as I cut and not reach clear across the table.This is the greatest idea since the tape dispensers that dispense little pieces of tape , the ones that fit on your wrist. I wish it would work with the contact paper I had hoped to cut with it. If you are just looking to cut thin paper in straight lines, then this product will be great for you. I tried to remove the jammed paper from the bottom of the mouse and I believe I made it worse. My Husband then tried to remove the paper and it would not budge. On less expensive, more flimsy paper, it tended to tear rather than cut, even when moved forward slowly and carefully. I had to try over and over to get it to cut, and although I was using it on simple 20lb paper pieces (the directions say max of two of this type can be used), I couldn't get it to cut correctly. Also, I think it's important to mention that I have only tried to cut paper and wrapping paper on a flat table....straight lines only. I used it on some cheap, thin wrapping paper....and it kept getting caught up and would rip the paper. I found this only to be good if you have sturdy paper, like wrapping paper. (20lb paper is on the cheaper end of scale). I have a few paper cutters but this is fun and functional. It doesn't catch the paper and tear it, it has a guide at the front edge that is very useful, it fits my hand well and it works! The plastic paper guide is the small red piece on the bottom of the device--no, you are not supposed to pull that piece off; if you do, the device won't work at all.This device is very, very different from scissors, so there is a bit of a learning curve. The paper is heavier than cheap wrapping paper but lighter than expensive wrapping paper if that gives you some idea.I found it easy to cut. It is really useful in cutting wrapping paper! I put paper down on several surfaces and it worked perfectly every time. You cut going UP the paper...not down on the paper (duh, right?) You can zigzag and be as creative at cutting the paper(s) as you want. Being one whose paper cutting skills are less-than-stellar (OK so I cut like a kindergartner) I thought this might be just the thing for me. Since most of my wrapping paper was lightweight paper, I didn't end up using it much.I suspect this is something that will just get buried in my junk drawer. I tried it again and again, with teeth incresingly gritted, but the paper wore out before the first cut was made.Then I discovered you have to thread the paper through the little feet on the bottom of the gadget. Unless the paper is seated exactly right, the mouse won't work. When cutting wrapping paper on a large flat surface - AND that wrapping paper isn't too thin/crumply - this is your tool! If your wrapping paper is of the "cheaper" variety, then getting it to feed into the guide can be a pain and cause the edge to crumple and not catch cleanly. Right to it...+++ PROS +++[+] Great for cutting paper strips, quickly[+] Cuts are clean and straight[+] Minimal to no snagging (as long as you've got enough tabletop space)[+] Ruler guide is helpful for maintaining straight lines for cutting[+] Fast and precise for cutting coupons--- CONS ---[-] This "mouse" has four wheels on the bottom and works in straight lines only, unlike a typical computer mouse that moves in all directions. If you try to run the paper through mouse, instead of rolling the mouse over the paper (say if you're cutting some wrapping paper and run out of table space so you might be tempted to "air cut" the rest of the way?) Wrapping paper, coupons yes, anything heavier than that no. The plastic paper guide came off rendering it useless.I wish I hadn't abused it - - it would have been great for all of the cutting and wrapping at Christmas :-/ If you are lucky to even get the paper to get cut without getting all bunched up and torn, the bunching and tearing happens at the end of your cut. It may work well for wrapping paper where one straight cut end-to-end is all that's needed. Great for wrapping paper, or for kids projects, as it will cut in wavy lines, and will cut through two pieces of 20 lb. paper at a time. However, it doesn't work that well on wrapping paper - it got a bit bunched up and torn. Used it to cut paper and worked well the first couple of times but then started to just tear the paper when I tried to use it. I've used it on regular wrapping paper and foil paper, and this is the one thing I've found that is quicker and easier with the scissor mouse. I've got some wrapping paper with a large grid pattern on the inside, and this is perfect for that. You just guide it along your paper and VOILA! You push it over paper like you would operate a computer mouse, and it cuts the paper underneath. It often wrinkled or tore the paper, and using the paper guide takes practice. The paper is fed into a thin guide at the bottom of the unit. If the paper is too thin, the mouse jams or even tears the paper. This looks like it would cut through paper very easily, but don't be fooled. It eats up paper instead. This ergonomically designed paper cutter in the shape of a computer mouse, will work for all of us.PROS:Any paper project is made easier because this mouse has a built-in ruler to guide your straight edge cuts. Yes, it would be great for wrapping paper, but realistically so are scissors. As long as the paper is nestled correctly in the front of the mouse, I get a nice LONG straight cut every time. It's not hard to seat the paper and with a few tries becomes pretty automatic. I just attempted to use it on inexpensive Target wrapping paper and got no where. On flimsy paper, the paper does bunch when trying to cut. But regular stiff paper, it does well. If the paper isn't grabbed by the blade correctly, it won't cut cleanly.The mouse is probably only useful for cutting gift wrap and other large sheets of paper. You risk shredding or crumpling the paper as you try to back up and remove the mouse.-Thin paper such as newsprint or thin wrapping paper cannot be cut with this mouse. The paper crumples as it goes through the safety guard and jams the device.-The mouse makes a straight cut.

When I got this, I was running it over paper wondering why it wasn't cutting anything.

That meant I had to waste paper starting over.

We used this to cut Christmas wrapping paper.
