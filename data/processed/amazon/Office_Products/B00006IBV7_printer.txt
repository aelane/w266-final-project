As long as you have a good printer, they work very well. If your printer is temperamental, like our printers are, you will also have to feed each sheet individually and wait for the printing process to complete. If you have a good printer, the sheets are great for making business cards and I was pleasantly surprised at how easy the cards pop out. Unfortunately, my printer does not detect the sheets as feed and tends to do funky things, so it is recommended to do a lot of tests and planning before printing.I also had an issue with Staples selling a defective product (the paper was rough and looked used) and Avery customer service was very responsive. Only a printer (person not machine) is going to tell these aren't professionally done. Maybe it's my HP printer... or maybe it's Avery, but I had to throw away the bottom row or two of a sheet because the text and artwork tended to creep up with each successive row. This was easy to set up in the printer. Almost too easily - you have to handle them carefully when loading the printer. I admit due to my printer I wasted a couple of sheets which was not Avery's card's error. The Avery Clean Edge Business Cards came out of my printer looking very nice. I have an older printer which is an Epson Stylus CX4200.
