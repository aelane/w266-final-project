These labels worked well for all these processes. The labels are a nice bright white, which I think also helps make the printing look cleaner. I absolutely love 3m labels. I've yet to have any labels come loose during the printing process thus wasting valuable ink... not to mention the added printer jam headache like other popular brands have done to me. The labels are made from quality paper and have a strong adhesive to stick to my packages. 750 labels will last a long time too. The labels stick firmly to applied services and do not bleed when written on. The labels also worked well in my laser printer, with no smearing or smudging.The labels are easy to use and easy to apply. There are 750 labels per each package, which makes convenient for me and I don't have to make repeated visits to the office supply store.PROS: Versatile, no smear, or smudge, serves their purpose and reasonably priced.CONS: None. These labels are great. I used the Avery labels for years but they were prone to peeling  off lately. I wanted to try these labels specifically for use on a color inkjet (Epson R380) to test the print quality. So, I was hoping these 3M labels would work well with color and as everyday labeling, and it appears they'll do OK. AND, there is another added benefit to these 3M labels: the instructions say that these work in laser printers as well, so I tried it out in our inexpensive Canon MF3240 laser printer, just printing black laser text. These labels worked VERY well in the laser printer! But if you are shopping for labels that print decent in color on an inkjet and very well on a laser, these 3Ms are your one-stop shop, and at a third of the price! I use these labels on envelopes and packages and they work fine, just like the other well-known product that costs more. These 1" Inkjet labels by 3M were a Godsend to this busy Education professional. I was able to successfully print labels on my first try!I was able to go the the 3M website and to Microsoft Online and get templates to use with these labels.

When these labels arrived, I immediately printed a new set of labels for our monthly bills.

I printed the labels and peeled them from the backing with ease.

Usually, when I print labels, attached them to boxes and store them in the attic, the labels usually start to peel away from the box in about 3 weeks because of the heat.
