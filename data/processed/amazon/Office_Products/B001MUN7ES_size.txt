This size (11 x 17 inches) seemed ideal. Its Just the right size if you have  double size fridge with a ice maker and it so cool that  you can peel it off if you want to one day. This is a nice size board and cleans well with a simple swipe of a damp cloth. I find this size board is a little on the small side for wall use, so I didn't try the mounting options. 11 x 17 is twice the size, which makes it big enough to really be useful ... but mounted on the wall, it still looks extremely small. Perfect size, attractive, functional and convenient. This is a decent size for home use, but unless you're handing one out to everyone in the boardroom, I don't see it as much for meetings. However it's a good size for a cupboard or that odd space by the entrance doorframe. The size is perfect for what I needed. First, the size makes it ideal for lists and reminders, but not as practical for brainstorming sessions or calenders. Its small size makes it perfect for making narrow strips of wall useful.The magnets that come with it do not scratch the surface and I did not have any problems getting single sheets of paper to stay on it with the included magnets.It cleans slightly more easily than our other dry erase boards and is a nice size to be portable.
