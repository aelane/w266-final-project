I do plan to get some of the large sheets as they would be ideal for making placemats.The cord is heavy duty too --- kind of like one you'd see on a vacuum cleaner. I made extra sure the sheets were flat each time, but they still over melted, leaving it with a crunched up look. I had to put it together and then when I finally got it going, it didn't heat up enough to stick the sheets together. It's really quick-26 sheets in 10 minutes, so this is also very convenient to get projects done quickly. It even came with 100 sheets. Two sheets of copy paper, back to back, for images on both side of the laminated sheet. Laminate sheets are pretty much what you pay for. If you use 3 mil sheets, you will defintely need to use a cardboard jacket or the film will bind and wrinkle. The advertised 10 sheets in 10 minute is definitely feasible.The biggest problem I found with this laminator was the lack of feed guides. I then had to feed three plain sheets of paper through the machine to clean it. Right now it is $38, which is almost free considering the free sheets. There are only a few laminating sheets in the box so buy some now. Initially I was worried that the sheets may be too hot right after lamination, but it was a little warm but not too hot. It also worked well laminating 2 sheets of paper in the same pouch. It took a few sheets to get it right but after that it was no longer a problem.We used it to create plastified signs which we then attach to boxes with velcro tape. I have cleaning sheets to run though it and it would be a good idea for people to get these cleaning sheets to run through it each time they are done using it.
