I have a pretty healthy sized gift box of "just in case" goodies that will fit just perfectly into one of these giftelopes. But, no more than most gift bags and you can't mail a gift bag. I sent a gift to a friend in New Jersey and she loved the packaging. Slim, expandable "gift envelopes" that look wonderful and easily sealed, pop into the outer envelop and off it goes.I hate gift-wrapping, and it is really such a waste of time, so here's the fast, perfect-looking way to cover that, miled or not.My wife stole the rest for her own gifting; I can see stocking up on these to avoid messing around with paper, tape and all the waste. This is nicer than just throwing a gift card into a regular greeting card. I would be more than happy to receive a gift in one. (Like gift cards and a book and a dog toy)These mailers are really nice and they just add a little something extra to the gift! When I mail gift cards in regular envelopes every year I don't worry so much about theft but they look so plain. I was able to conceal gift cards, DVDs, and books without the recipient being able to guess what they were as soon as they saw the package. However, because it looks like a gift I feel like it might run the risk of being stolen out of somebody's mailbox if there are any Grinches running around this holiday season (which I sincerely hope they're aren't, but you never know in this day and age).I'm really excited to use these packages to send items to my friends overseas because I think this will be way more exciting for them to get in the mail instead of one of those free white Priority Mail boxes from the post office.Once I see how these hold up in the mail and what the recipients have to say about the packaging then I'll decide if I want to order and use these again or not. These decorative gift pouches and outer mailers are terrific. These gift boxes are cute and very handy when you need a quick wrap.
