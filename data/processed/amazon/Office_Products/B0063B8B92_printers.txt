I hope it stands up to continued use.I've had other Epson printers in the past and overall find them to be of good quality. I know most printers seem to be going the same route, but I refuse to give a decent rating to a printer that costs $100.00 and tries to control your every move with re-filling ink or re-placing ink cartridges. Epson printers have really come a long way in the past few years. I used the Memory Stick Pro on both printers. Both printers print very quickly. Usually only larger printers can do its own page flipping to print 2 sides. Both other printers take forever to warm up and print.The print quality (color print pages, not photos) was virtually the same for the two Epsons, and to be honest, I didn't compare it with the HP because it is out of ink.The only thing I don't really like about this printer is the size. I've tried several Epson printers.

I personally trust Epson and Canon the most when it comes to printers.

Some of those printers are actually unused and gathering dust (the one my daughter got free with her Dell laptop, for example, which takes $120 cartridges).
