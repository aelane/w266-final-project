Great all in one printer. As a 'home' printer, this comes as close to perfect as they come. HP supplies the printer itself, 'starter' ink cartridges, print heads and a phone wire. The printer can be controlled from a PC or directly through a touch-screen color display and several buttons that generally duplicate options on the menus available through the touch-screen interface. It can be configured to either a local printer, connected to a PC via a USB cable or as a network printer, wired (Ethernet) or wireless (802.11g). It monitors the printer's status, including the ink levels and allows for configuring printing, scanning, faxing and other capabilities such as the forwarding of documents to network folders (tested) or to email (not tested yet). I was thrilled to get this printer through the Vine program. This means you can put the printer anywhere as long as you have a wireless router. You no longer need to connect the printer to the router or the computer. When you first turn on the printer it takes about 20 minutes to align the printer heads. You can do this directly on the printer, using the touch screen.Print quality is great, using generic paper or photo paper. This included the printer automatically detecting my wireless network and getting an IP address from the router DHCP server. Duplexing from both the printer and the copier worked well with the printer pausing for a few seconds after the first side is printed to let the ink dry. My last printer worked somewhat with my wireless network, but was not a true wireless printer. HP claims that this printer's cost per copy for color copies is less than those of a color laser printer. This is 2010, they should have a printer that can feed paper. It is a full-featured and very capable ink-jet printer that should fulfill most office printing, faxing, scanning and copying chores with ease. I also own a Brother MFC-490CW, Brother MFC-490CW Color Inkjet Multifunction Printer which is also a wireless all-in-one printer (and is a very good value for the money, but the Brother printer does not have duplex). The Brother printer also has OCR, but the software is so error prone, it makes it mostly useless and an exercise in futility. It actually works for me and has been astoundingly accurate for me so far.I think this is a great printer and would buy it again based on what I've experienced so far. Keeping this printer in one of my bedrooms, I first tried printing with it sitting on the bed. I've never used a wireless printer before, but have always hated having to have my printer right next to my desktop computer, since it takes up so much room. The printer also has a full color LCD touch screen on it which worked very well, and didn't come off like a gimmick like a lot of touch screens on computer peripherals nowadays. I am not ready to scrap the printer at each workstation because it's annoying to have to go to another room to check pages. I purchased this printer six months ago, and have been disappointed with its performance and features. I use this printer in my home office, and find that it is a bit noisy. This printer is so neat! Setting the printer up wirelessly was a breeze; it found our router and then I needed to put in the secret code. I am so totally enthralled with this all-in-one printer! If you are looking for an all-in-one printer look no further, you have found it!!!!!!!!!P.S. I was so excited about all this printer can do that I forgot to mention how fast it is! This printer was shipped to me with no outer brown box to conceal what I was getting; a label was stuck onto the box that it comes in and there were huge pictures of the product with "HP Printer" printed all over it. It would be the only printer I own, and if it's the only printer you ever own, you'll be very happy with it.09/29/2010 UPDATE: This printer broke after about 18 months of light use 3 to 4 days a week. I am honestly stunned that a Hewlett Packard printer failed like this so quickly. The printer jerks and jumps around during the start up process and initializing. I have the printer on a separate table which makes this very noticable.
