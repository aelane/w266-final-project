I have been very happy with my Panasonic phones so I knew my father would love his. He wanted one of the phones in his bedroom with the ringer off. These phones are easy to use and are loaded with features. They are the best phones. Cell phones don't need that but land-line phones do. Recently, the phones started to sound muffled. The phones are being used with the OOMA phone service. You can use 3 phones to charge the base in a power outage and just talk on one to get longer useage or just keep a battery backup inverter ( my cobra cjic 350 ) will power a phone for a week with hours of usage . The phones were constantly going out of range, even when sitting next to the base unit, and the battery life was one day if it wasn't on the charger. I'm not reviewing those phones here, but I just wanted to explain just why I might feel like this set of Panasonic phones is the greatest thing since sliced bread! I really needed 4 phones, so I bought this. Other phones say that you can mount them on the wall, but when you do the phone and base stick way out from the wall. I've had Panasonic phones before & they have always been good, & lasted years. 5 phones for the price was a great deal. These phones work just great. From the portable phones you must navigate the menu to start the intercomm, not hard but dumb. The phones alert with a flashing light in addition to the ringer. All five phones announce the person that is calling between rings and I can here it all over my house. I have had these phones a couple of months. Again, this is UNACCEPTABLE if it is the phones fault. The phones hold a charge pretty well, which I like.

To be clear - these phones are a bit weak on battery power.Conclusion:This is a near perfect cordless phone offering clarity, great range, no interference with existing cordless appliances, a wonderful display and a number of other features.

Cordless phones have already matured to the point that companies are just playing with features!

All of my other phones have been.There is a limit of 6 handsets--not all companies limit it to 6 handsets.While the talking caller ID is ok, there is a delay, so often i already know who it is before it tries to pronounce it.
