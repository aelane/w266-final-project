The report cover is not a heavy binder, so you can flip it open, hold it, and bend it in ways you can't with a stiff binder. Other than that, I really like this report cover. These report covers are made to hold up to 30 pages and they open with "landscape orientation". This is especially true if you have a little thick report (works alright for ~ 10 page report). With these Smead report covers who you print something off and slip them in, clip them, and be ready for use.I don't know if they are overpriced. These are sturdy report covers and were easy to secure papers into. This report cover is perfect and makes my presentations pop! No more having to turn a report cover to the side for viewing slides the correct way. If I'm presenting a report with many pages, the top document can be referenced without opening the cover because of the transparent cover. This report cover also saves me money, because it's reusable! If you must use a report cover, this one is is very good. These report covers do their job with a lot of style. What more do you want from a report cover? These report covers are so nice!
