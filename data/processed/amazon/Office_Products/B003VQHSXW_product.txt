When I got the product I was disappointed as there is little room to write down any meaningful schedule. Overall I like this product, it allows you to have a tangible way of keeping track of what you are doing in a week and your overall weight loss goal. Also true, but again, that's what this product is sold for - to be a visual aid / reminder to help people plan or track their workouts.As a physical therapist, I like anything that helps get people (myself included) moving. For a product like this, I could see multiple people in a household using a single board by writing in different colors. While the product is intended for planning exercise schedules, I actually ended up using it to a greater extent for taking random notes (e.g. Overall, I recommend this product from Expo. Being an Expo product, it is made of high quality materials and is very sturdy. This product is simply an opportunistic exercise in unnecessary branding.I would have rated it one star but it is sturdy and, in conjunction with a more full-featured program, may serve an occasional purpose. Sadly, I can't really recommend this product. If a product like this will keep you motivated, then the Biggest Loser white board would be worth every penny and then some. This product is not for me! I don't really feel its a necessary product as any old piece of paper will do the trick. Would review this product, but, it arrived with the pen shattered and dried out completely.
