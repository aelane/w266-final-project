The Epson WorkForce 840 is a great home or home office color inkjet all-in-one printer. It's cut out for home office/personal business use.Once out of the box, it's no more difficult to set up than most other printers, although it did take a bit longer to get my wireless laptop up to speed, although Wi-Fi connectivity to my PC was a snap.As for the performance, the WorkForce 840 was a real standout when it came to the fast printing (15 pages per minute b&w;, 9.3 ppm color), and virtually laser-sharp b&w; print resolution.I also like the fact that it prints two-sided documents. This one is staying put in my home office.The set-up Wizard takes you through the installation steps as expected, although you have the option to install "bonus software," something I declined because I'm running out of hard drive space. It's ideal for a home office that doesn't have much space for dedicated office machines. If you are looking for a home business printer then this printer may be for you. Even for a home user, at this price, you need this. For a home user, I'd probably never use the ADF to scan a stack of documents to PDF though. If you're looking for a small home printer, this might be a big of an overkill if you don't need the ADF for the scanner or even a fax machine (who has a fax anymore?) And it works great for home use or home office semi professional use, or even in small companies. Typing in the WEP Key was awkward but it only had to be done once and all the home internet equipment could immediately see the device.We had to install drivers for our MAC laptops from the Epson site. If you're looking for home use (as I was) this may actually be overkill. I've been using my Epson WF 840 in my home office in a high capacity manner for over a year and this is easily the most durable and consistent printer I have ever owned.I have never experienced any paper jams and never had to troubleshoot the machine during set-up and install which was incredibly easy. Typing in my home WEP key to my wireless router was all I had to do. If you have DSL at home, you can fax from this printer if you obtain a DSL filter. In my home office I have several printers with primarily the Epson Artisan 810 being our main all-in-one as we do a lot of disc printing. I consider myself a typical home users.

I decided to get the Epson Workforce 840 for home use even though it is marketed as a business printer.

I have a home network, and it was detected perfectly, much to my relief.

And, being targeted towards the home office, don't expect it to take the abuse as your printers at work.
