Although I wasn't delighted with the color selection I received (pink, green, etc.) The color coding is what makes these labels. I use one color for office supplies and another color for photo negatives as I have each stored in plastic boxes that one cannot see through.When printing only four labels I found I could go back and print additional labels and the paper would properly feed through my printer. I used one color for the officers and one color for the membership. Not comes along these color coded, removal labels in a 2x4 inch size and they have made all the difference. Some complains the color is too bright, and I can see why, but it is not a major problem for me since my primary application is labeling glass jars in the kitchen. There are 4 color options of Pink, Blue, Yellow and Green and the palette though pastel is not so light colored that they aren't noticeable. are now color coded. I love these color labels.

I like the color scheme b/c the bright colors are easy to see.
