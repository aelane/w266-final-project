Not a bad product and it works as stated, it's just a little plastic-y. This product has somewhat of an ergonomic grip, but really this seems unneccessary. This product is ideal for this purpose and has a very comfortable handle.However, I didn't realize what a multi-tasker the Safe Cut Package Opener is. You might damage the product you are opening.Also, it's more straightforward than using scissors (the angle you use makes them awkward, and even risky to use).This is cheaper than any knife I own, and safer. I strongly recommend this handy and useful product which beats the blues on opening the tough ones every time. I'm sorry to say I was disappointed in this product. I don't expect this product to last without breaking. I just moved so I was able to test this product on about 20 boxes and a couple of plastic packages. This product is nothing more than a very small knife/dull razor blade.

I really wanted to like this product, as I have cut myself, sometimes fairly seriously, on a number of occasions using a utility knife to open both boxes and blister packs.

This product seemed to be the ideal solution to the problem, however, I was sorely disappointed with the end results.The concept is fairly simple and seems to be a good idea.

I think they were going for a utilitarian product and it just missed the mark.The description says that it comes with a refillable blade cartridge, but for this price, you would think that it might just be easier to throw it away and start over instead of risking a laceration when trying to work with a new blade.It is a fun little toy, but in the end, I cannot see it performing on the majority of packaging materials that come through my home.
