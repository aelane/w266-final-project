This is the designated ink for the printer and it really DOES last extra long. Also, XL means there is more ink, it does not change the size of the actual cartridge so it is just like the regular 210 with more ink stuffed into it. While using this for printing this ink show great quality on my documents I rate this excellent quality. Great ink and the XL cartridge last a long time.The reason i give it 4 stars is that i paid $25 for the printer and the ink is almost $20 just for the black.I have a Brother all in one printer fax scanner and copier that i pay $10 for 15 cartridges of black and color and the ink is perfect and last a long time.Needless to say i will not buy another Canon printer again. SO I was looking around to replace my old ink, I have to say the Canon really goes through ink fast.. At this price its really worth using the name brand I believe, then bother with filling the old ink cartridge, or buying non-name brand ( which I have done in the past ) Since I really don't print that much, I decided to get the real thing, and it installed great, and prints great. always bought my ink from here since i had my printer about 3 years. Quality OEM ink cartridge. I love Canon ink over HP inks, i think these lasts much longer and amazon almost always has the best price.

this cannon PG-210XL ink works like ink should we never had any problems with it.

Its ink, and with canon I have yet to find a 'refurbished' cartridge that is as black as the original

It is the ink designed for my Printer, it fits and it prints great copy.
