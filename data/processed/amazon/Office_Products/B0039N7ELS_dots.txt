These adhesive dots make crafting so much easier. I was even able to roll the sticky dots onto a pipe cleaner and stick pom poms & beads to that!It took a few tries for my son to figure out how to hold the dot roller at the right angle to get the sticky stuff on the paper, but now he loves it. Best of all, since the dots are really small and clean, they don't drip or ooze out of the area where you placed them -which makes them easier to use than glue (with no mess to clean up! I also placed some dots on the photos front surface as well.The results so far have been promising. )We have tried glue dots in the past. The dots go on, you press the picture down, and you are done! The adhesive dots are a hybrid of glue and double sided tape. This was no different as the adhesive dots were very easy to apply in both starting and stopping the tape and it's very comfortable to hold. The glue dots are a stronger adhesive that glue sticks and much cleaner to use that white glue or rubber cement. The dots come off where you want them to and stay where you put them. The adhesive dots are easy to apply and hold very well. The dots are really cool, and stop when you lift up the dispenser from the paper. I thought it would come out as dots but it's actually dispensed like correction tape but the strip is a clear adhesive with dots and it does break until you lift the roller so you can get the precise length you want. The dots are close together and have no issues transferring to the paper you wish to stick. It is simply roll-on glue dots spaced closely together. I have not run out of the sticky dots yet, so I don't know how complicated (or uncomplicated) it is to refill. The little dots came out just fine and they adhere to the three or four different kinds of paper I tried it on. Once flipped over, the dots disappear because they go on dry. They just roll out a few little dots and can stick paper together for hours. With the Scotch Adhesive Roller, I just roll a few sticky dots along parts of the edges of the transcript, and stick it right in. The adhesive dots are tiny and flat and won't be seen under the paper, unlike glue blobs. I did notice that you didn't get transfer of all of the dots from the disperser to what you are trying to adhere so that is a little disappointing. Just put down the dots and then stick stuff to them!The bond is permanent, although this probably depends on the materials you use. After applying dots, the used tape is neatly rolled back into the second spool, so there is nothing to cut off or to fuss with after application. It rolls out microscopic glue dots. The glue dots were easy to remove from the glass & didn't leave a messy residue. The adhesive dots are low-profile, so as I mentioned above, you're not going to get these to hold anything terribly heavy weight or thick, but for standard paper use and scrapbooking needs, I can't imagine that you wouldn't find this tool to be handy when you need to apply an adhesive. I had expected larger adhesive dots. The "dots" are very small but very dense. The "dots" are very flat, so there won't be any bubbling up underneath whatever you're gluing. Lo and behold, they are tiny, tiny dots of glue; and there are lots of them that roll out in a strip. The sticky dots roll out smoothly with each use without the tape roll getting all tangled up inside, like it has with similar products I have used. The dots hold the paper firmly to other paper, but also allow you to reposition an object if you pull it off carefully. I also like it because the dots are 'dry'....thus you canuse it on thinner stock that tends to warp and bubble when using liquid glue. Though they are tiny little dots in reality, functionally I feel that this is almost equivalent to just putting a strip of sticky tape down. The dots are so tiny that you can barely see them. The dots also make it easy to do curves. Just roll some dots onto the paper, press together, and it sticks very well. It rolls small dots of glue down on a surface. Little dots of glue so there's no mess of trying to rip off pieces of tape or having to get the white-out strips off. I can apply just a few dots to the corners and center edges and very neatly apply the item to my credenza. The dots are the secret. Neat, quick and easy glue dots in a roller format that's clean and works great. The adhesive dots are quite sticky and hold as well as double-sided tape. The dots are not colored. When he told me it was adhesive dots, I wasn't too thrilled, having tried another brand of this type.
