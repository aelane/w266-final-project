The size is also good for allowing enough room to cut the artwork out to frame or show off. Also, depending on the size of your bag, this notebook may or may not fit. The size is fabulous when you have a gifted artist and one whose drawings can get big and complex. We usually buy the smaller size for my eight year old to use with her Prismacolor pencils. We will definitely purchase this size again. I am sure I will be re-ordering more of these in this larger size. I guess I didn't see the size when I ordered this, but this thing is big. This size may be more for people that need a larger format or like to take notes on quality paper in a bigger sheet of paper. Generous size. The 14&#34;x11&#34; size is also a big plus to me, having more real estate without going to 13x19 sheets (I use those in my printer) is just the right size.

For me the size is too big, but that's a personal choice and does not reflect on the product.

Because of the size of the pages, and how many of them there are, the book is very heavy and takes up a lot of real estate in a bag or on a desk.

It is also a good size book to fit into my larger bag.
