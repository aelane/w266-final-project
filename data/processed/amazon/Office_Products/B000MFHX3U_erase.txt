I cleaned the dry erase board with an Expo eraser and could still see shadows of the words erased. My dry erase board wound up looking practically as good as new. I have two dry erase boards at my house. The standard dry erase eraser is shaped much like a chalkboard eraser. I even had an old dry erase board with some writing on it that wouldn't erase with the old eraser that came with it, or with paper towel and windex. If used properly, dry erase boards don't need extra duty cleaning too much. We got him dry erase crayons to go with it and they're not easy to clean off. I use them dry for dry erase marker. I carry one of these, along with a dry erase marker, in my school bag - anytime I need to do show some calculations, marketing bullets, etc., I just whip this out and use! The Mr. Clean eraser worked just as well on the dry erase marker as the 3M eraser did. (I didn't get him dry erase markers because of the smell). When the erase runs over some residual marks, you can feel it sticking a little bit. It cleans dry erase marks and when you get it wet it'll erase permanent markers.Here is what I don't like.-The shape.
