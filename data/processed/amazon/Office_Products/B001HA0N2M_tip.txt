They have a wide tip and a narrow tip for different uses. The tip sin't really fine tip as described. I'd like an even smaller or finer tip but image that this is a problem of ink/tip/usability that just hasn't been solved yet. So, this is good enough for now and much better than the standard tip on most pens.The ink is also easy to erase from the dry erase board cleanly even after two weeks and  a bit. All in all I am happy with them, jst wish I could find true fine tip dry erase markers They're described as fine tip, but they tend to write a little wider than what one might normally think of as a fine tip. With the fine tip you can get more on your dry erase board, too. The Quartet Endura Glide Fine Tip (round tip) dry-erase markers are the best all around dry erase markers among all the brands and types I have used. The fine tip is good for white boards in your home, an office, or a small board room, but they might be too thin for a classroom or large conference room.In my small home office I have a wall-sized white board that I use for mapping out ideas. There is a rounded tip which is fairly substantial, actually. They are fine tip, so you will not want to use them  to write things down for people far away, but they are great for my daughter to use on her small dry-erase pad to practice numbers and letters. I really like the fine tip, it's easier for me to write with than the expo, and I can fit more on the board. The Quartet fine tip eraser is my favorite dry-erase marker. These are fine tip dry erase markers by Quartet. The fine tip means I can write much more clearly, much more compactly, and still get vibrant colors. The tip cap keeps them from rolling too far, which I consider an advantage. The fine tip is especially nice for writing in small spaces, like a dry erase calendar, and the ink flows easily and smoothly. If you are looking for fine tip dry erase markers, you can&#8217;t really go wrong with these. They have a tip that that resists smushing. They write well, the tip glides easily, and they erase reasonably well with a white board eraser. The tip is pretty big in my opinion. However, the tip is not that thin, the color is not that bold and they must be used only on certain nonporous surfaces.T
