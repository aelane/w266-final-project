The second problem is when the labels fit OK but the paper is made with a non-heat sealable surface, so the labels print out OK but the toner just smears right off when you rub your finger over it while applying it. I've never had that problem, so I'll just use whatever is on sale/cheaper! I had no problem with my printer. I did not encounter any problem whatsoever using this permanent address labels from 3M. No problem at all, and that's just what I'm after. No problem going through my laser printer. They usually worked well and the only problem I have had with those labels is that the alignment is not always perfect when they print out. I solved that problem by printing in a small, number 8 or 9 font, so that there is a plenty of blank area around the address. Not a problem trying to remove them from the sheet, but generally useful.

I had no problem running them through my printer and they do have a very strong adhesive.

The major problem that I have with some labels is that they smudge and don't stick strongly.

I have had a problem in the past with lables coming off or starting to roll up after they were applied to my envelope.
