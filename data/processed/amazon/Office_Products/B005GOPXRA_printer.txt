The printer has been working like a champ every since. Once I got my user-error fixed, it has been a great printer. Unlike my old printer this one actually prints double sided and it doesn't get stuck. Aside from that, the printer is great and does everything I need it to. I am enjoying this printer as a one-stop solution for my printer needs. However, I cannot connect the printer to the Chromebook. The printer is fast and it does not make a lot of noise when it prints (which makes my dogs happy.) I was pleasantly surprised when I was able to see the printer listed in the print options. I got this printer about 3 weeks ago and since this was my first "wireless" printer, I was expecting this to take awhile. As I mentioned above, this is my first wireless printer and let me tell the convenience is amazing. The printer does support front and back printing so that helps to save paper. Since I've started using the printer, I haven't had as many cleaning cycles as other reviewers experienced. Setting up my new all-in-one printer to work with our network was easy, following Canon's clearly written, enclosed directions. It is a good printer. This printer uses the cleaning cycle every time it turned on. This is my first printer that wasn't HP, and I have to be honest: I was shocked withe build quality, features and intuitiveness of operation and setup. The printer is large but really beautiful and elegant.The plastics are shiny and clean.The touch sensitive buttons on the top only illuminate if they're relevant to the operation you're doing-- such as "copy color, copy B&W;".The ink cartridges are individual colors so you don't have to throw out a whole cartridge if one color is empty.Wifi setup was quite easy, as was the unbox/untape/plug-in/load with ink/calibrate process.I'll plan to update the review more once I've done more printing. Have had the printer for a week now and love it. I would recommend this printer to anyone looking to upgrade from their old printer at a very reasonable price. I won't be using this printer much anyway.
