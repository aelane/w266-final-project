Also, the red labels are a bit dark and do not show up writing as well as the others with a standard point pen. These are really fun labels and there's lots of things you can do with them. The labels do come off of paper very easily which is nice and will stick back down several times once they've been pulled off the paper. However, I didn't want labels that would stick to the books and ruin them. He printed "TO" and "FROM"  on the labels, applied it to the cards. He used the labels from the page that was ruined for sealing the cards. These labels are a convenient way to color-code things and can be used for a variety of purposes. These labels work as described on the package, and are compatible with a printing template that you can use in your PC application and print out using a laser or inkjet printer. These are terrific labels for a yard sale or round bottle lids. The labels we were using before were not sticking very well to our Rubbermaid containers and they curled up on the edges a bit. The labels stick on firmly, but they do come off if you need them to. I use many labels like these by another brand but they are not the kind you can print on. They are not as sticky as the labels I was using and I am not sure they will stay on my mylar and glass applications for a long period of time which can make inventory a nightmare, only time will tell. It was easy to remove the labels from products as they use the same adhesive as a post-it note. I was excited to receive these labels as I am constantly using multiple sizes of Post-it notes and permanent sticking round labels around the house. Because I can never remove these labels, I had to make sure that everyone knows that an appointment was no longer valid. These new labels are a boon. I'm really happy with these labels. And best of all, they easily peel off without leaving any residue (unlike many Avery labels). Enjoy your labels.

It is important that the labels can be attached and removed easily, which these POST-IT LABELS do perfectly.I have also started using these color-coding labels for my personal system of organizing my schedule.

I most especially loved using the labels for the multi-family garage sale.

These labels will fit in your printer!
