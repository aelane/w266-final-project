This was great at first, but then stopped sharpening pencils completely. New pencils take about five seconds to reach a nice point, so you do not need to spend a lot of time interrupting the homework process.Occasionally, a pencil is sharpened slightly off-center, but rotating it a bit and sticking it back in will solve the problem. I didn't try it with colored pencils, just regular ones.I can't add much more than what has already been said. And pencils get sharpened quite well on any of the six settings which are easy to adjust. While I recognize that it was sharpening many pencils over the course of those months, it still seemed very premature for it to break down so quickly. I'm always using pencils at home and at work because they are inexpensive compared to ink pens. The pencils I've sharpened come out with a nice tip. My pencils end up with a normal, fine point - not the exaggerated mechanical pencil tip that breaks off as soon as a little pressure is applied. Drafting and other pencils can be expensive, so the last thing you want is a sharpener that eats half the pencil! I can literally sharpen up my pencils late at night and not disturb anyone else in the house.A great little sharpener that will please anyone who still uses a pencil in their everyday life -- you can't go wrong with this little wonder!

I was able to sharpen 50 pencils and the tray still wasn't full!

I've sharpened colored pencils, regular hexagon shaped pencils, novelty pencils, glitter pencils, and fabric pencils and have not had the sharpener jam up once.

It also sharpens pencils to a very severe point.
