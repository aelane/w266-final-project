This is my first sketchbook. This is a great sketchbook. This is a large sketchbook which was desired because we've got enough small one's. I went to give this sketchbook to the better drawer and the other twin started to cry. This is a sketchbook and so it has sketch paper in it.The backing cardboard is good and stiff, which is another big deal in a sketchbook -- you do not want your paper flopping around while you're trying to draw! Overall, this is a VERY nice sketchbook, and the fact is that if you want to learn to draw and/or exercise your &#34;right brain&#34;, you will DRAW AT ALL TIMES, carry your sketchbook with you everywhere you go and DRAW!This is a really nice sketchbook! The sketchbook is sturdy and has held up well under use. I had never used a sketchbook this large but find I really like it, especially when sketching outdoors or in the city. I highly recommend this inexpensive priced sketchbook for artists of various levels who want a good practice sketchbook. This jumbo-sized sketchbook (diary) is a outstanding asset to my daily creative enterprises! It is a nice big sketchbook with heavy pages for drawing and sketching. This is an 11X 14 sketchbook but if you rip along the perforated edge it's more like 10 1/4&#34; x 14&#34;. I'm a sketchbook junkee. Nice hefty sketchbook for conceptualization, but I would do anything in here that I would want to keep long-term, or more fully develop within the pad itself. It's a sketchbook.

If you are looking for a portable sketchbook to take with you and pull out when you get inspired, get something smaller.
