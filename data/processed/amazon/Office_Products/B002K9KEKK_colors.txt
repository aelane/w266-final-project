I'm not excited about the colors, but I don't really care. It's just nice to have different colors to label things at times. I love these very bright, easy to distinguish colors these labels come in. They are in bright colors: yellow, blue, green, and pink. I put different colors on the various items in my ZipLoc bags so that I don't have to rummage around to find vegetables, meat, fish, etc. The colors are so bright and easy to see. The different colors make it easy to organize like items. The colors really stand out and I can color code those I mail to occasional or often.My husband can also use them in his shop. Great colors too your eyegoes right to them. The colors are very vibrant on the labels and hand written or printed text show up in sharp contrast. The colors of the font and some clipart I used for the gift tags for Easter gifts for our grandchildren came out clear and vibrant. The bright colors make is easy to color code. These colors really stand out.The adhesive is a nice blend of sticky, yet easy to remove from any surface (they easily peel back off from paper).Easily printed on by hand or with a laser printer or ink jet printer.These won't adhere to cloth (well not for more than a few seconds if you flex it), so you can't use them as name tags. The four assorted colors assists in locating the types of sewing/craft items at a glance, as they are stored up high on shelves. I like the colors, the size is great and they REALLY helped me get our in-home office and closet organized. Wow- when they say Neon colors, they aren't kidding! The colors are bright neon and very visible. Regarding the actual colors - black ink shows up well on them, but I don't particularly love the pastel color scheme. The colors are all sufficiently bright, but not what I would consider "neon". They come in different colors so you can easily color code your folders based on your needs.
