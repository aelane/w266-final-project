That said, most washi tapes are semi-transparent as well but have the added benefit of becoming opaque when layered. Overall, I prefer washi tapes over the scotch decorative tapes but I have a few scrapbook projects where I think that the scotch tape version would be ideal. The tapes were a fascination for our kids and their friends. This is similar to washi tapes that are so popular now for cards, wrapping, scrapbooking, etc. However, not all washi tapes are made the same, and some are less sticky than others, adhering well to paper but not many other surfaces. These tapes can be used for decorating scrap book pages, greeting cards (purchased or hand-made) and all kinds of other objects to which plain old masking tape will stick, so they could be a creative product to have around. I love these decorative tapes for adding a little embellishment to my various business projects, using different colored tapes to accentuate various product packaging etc. These bright tapes are so much fun for paper crafting projects. I like these tapes, but I don't find them to be anything special. Anyway, the tapes themselves are not completely opaque; print and other material underneath can be seen through.These tapes can help make a boring package or project appear attractive. I find it fun to use these tapes when wrapping gifts.
