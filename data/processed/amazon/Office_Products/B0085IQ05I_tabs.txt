Each one of the tabs shows up perfectly -- making it easier to find and retrieve what is needed.This is Letter Size, but is a generously-proportioned "Letter Size".There are two nice pockets on the first divider, where you can write a list of what is organized inside. The tabs go from A to XYZ - I see no monthly tabs; perhaps someone forgot to enclose them at the factory?? Inside the tabs are tiered. Although it comes with A-Z tabs which is all well and good, I sometimes wish office supplies like this came with blank tabs so as to make for individualized sorting, e.g. When you view the tabs through the clear plastic you can easily see where your information is. So far I've set up the following tabs: travel documents (copies of tickets, VISA info etc), health information (shot records etc), travel insurance, travel agency itinerary, and emergency telephone numbers for all of us going in the front tabs. The back tabs have an expanded itinerary that I put together with information about the sites, hotels etc that we will see (100 pages), birding check list, shopping/souvenirs ideas, blank paper for notes and an empty tab to keep information I pick up on the trip. It comes with A-Z tabs but no Monthly tabs, though one can write on the blank backs of the A-Z tabs to create whatever kinds of tabs one might prefer.The Navy colored organizer that I own is smart enough looking that I would not hesitate to bring it to business meetings, legal meetings, financial meetings, etc. Until I tried using the tabs (those little things that stick up from the enclosed folders that inform you of the folders' contents) I was extremely pleased with this sturdy, handsome file folder. The tabs alternate between clear and blue, and someone chose the wrong color blue. This is supposed to come with alphabetical, numbered and monthly tabs so you can customize the dividers, but it only came with alphabetical tabs. For that, I'm not using alphabetical, numeric or monthly tabs - instead, I made my own tabs for topics like Bills, Bank Statements and the like. The tiered tabs are very useful, although not always large enough for my labeling. The blue tabs are a bit dark, however. I'd prefer blank tabs so I can label them as best I see fit. Also, there are only 12 tabs, which is enough for me, but may not be enough for you depending on your files. There are tabs on all twelve sections for labeling, though the paper tabs themselves are for some reason not included.
