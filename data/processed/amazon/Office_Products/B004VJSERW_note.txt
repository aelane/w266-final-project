For that, I think I'll continue to place the note off to the side of it and drawing a big arrow. This clear sticky note responds better to pencil than I would have expected. A see-through sticky note is a great product concept. Writing on the sticky note and putting it over something written or typed would make it difficult to read either your note or what's underneath.They are definitely transparent enough to read through to any paper you've attached the sticky note to and adhere well to the paper with an easy/clean removal.When testing different writing implements, the ballpoint pen and permanent marker worked great. I can write a note, or draw an arrow and still see the original's information. Second, since you can see through the note, what you write on it becomes harder to read if you post it on top of anything with words or even patterns. Even when pressing the note onto its target I'm prone to touching and smearing the ink.I would not buy this product unless you had a very specific need for it and are able to let each sticky note dry before handling them. How often have you put a sticky note on something, and then had to attempt to reposition it because it was hiding part of the page? If you need to know what is under the sticky note it is transparent so you can read through it. But this translucent sticky note invention left me feeling underwhelmed. Your writing on the note will be what you see. Standard sticky note sized. You can post a sticky note on a printed document and still read the text or see the photos underneath the sticky note. I love this new post-it note! You can write a note on it for reference while not covering up the information beneath it.
