These are also cut very close to the 4x6 size, so you will have minimal border on your picture.Recommended pouches and an excellent product from Swingline! They're the perfect size for standard postcards. The 4' x 6' size works well for smaller things like sample birth certificate cards and insurance registration cards. The size of the pack is not bulky; not a square box but a fat envelope. Now with this smaller size, all of that hassle is gone. The size of these pouches might lead to a bit of waste from time to time, however one might also note that it gives you a great deal of flexibility with what you're going to be laminating. These are the perfect size for photos...glue a few magnets on the back and stick them on the refrigerator door.High school kids love these to make locker magnet photos.Good basic smaller size pouches, they go through the laminator well. I loved the size, the thickness, and the ease in using them.

When I ordered these I didn't realize they were photo size, but it has been fun thinking up projects to use them for.

This 4x6" size is great for making small placards for event registration, or even laminating modern photographs*.
