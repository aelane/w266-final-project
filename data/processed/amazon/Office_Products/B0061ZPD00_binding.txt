the binding cord was super easy to put in, and I really liked the look of the "book" I was able to put together. If you do any more than that, you'll probably want to purchase a binding machine.However, I really wish this product included more pre-punched paper! I've often been tempted to buy a binding device, the ones that punch holes and one uses a plastic comb to complete. I have always wanted a binding machine for my office but they were always too expensive and/or too hard to use. These spiral binding kits are great. Ok, if you can't afford a binding machine (which doesn't cost all that much on here and has free shipping), then this would work. This binding system was so easy to use. It is what it is: a fine binding kit for professional-looking reports that takes a little bit more time to assemble than what you are used to. If you don't want to invest in a binding machine, this is a good value. If you really want to do your own binding, there are better plastic binders out there. Most importantly, the binding is holding up to daily use in the kitchen (including the time that I dropped the book)! If you don't own a binding machine but have the need for a nice presentation, you could order this set instead of spending much more at a local place.
