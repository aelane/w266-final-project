It was whisper quiet and every single pencil came out with a fine point. I like the adjustable pencil size bezel because it reduces vibration and makes it easier to hold the pencil while it is being sharpened. However, I thought it was acceptable because the pencil worked. With varying pencil size openings, it's good to use in art class and with kinder students who sometimes use chubby pencils. It is amazing how difficult it can be to find a good pencil sharpener! The X-Acto will eat your entire pencil if you let it. If you reinsert the already sharpened pencil, the sharpener will again start and take off some more of the pencil before stopping. A superior electric pencil sharpener. It turns off when pencil tip is sharp, and it's quiet. I thought I'd broken it, but it just ceases sharpening altogether when it feels a pencil is sharp, and they were indeed very sharp. - On about my 6th pencil sharpener, both manual & electric. Overall I will adjust and if I desire to continue using a 1" pencil I better do that with an old fashioned .99 cent school sharpener.... Oh, makes a great paper weight too! This is the third electric pencil sharpener I've used, and it is by far the best. This is a fast, quiet and efficient pencil sharpener. If you gently push a pencil in it will bring it to a perfect point without using much of the wood. The pencil shavings reservoir is large enough that you can easily sharpen a box of pencils without having to dump it out. I've bought cheap pencil sharpeners in the past. It holds the pencil in firmly and stops automatically when it is done and the point is sharp. If you're looking for a pencil sharpener that can handle a classroom of students or a department of office workers this would be one to consider.Over the past forty odd years or so, I've worked at a variety of occupations. Number two is a pencil sharpener. So getting this pencil sharpener was a stroke of luck. This pencil sharpener is huge and puts a super fine point on even the cheapest pencils. Overall, this is a pretty good pencil sharpener - first of all, it's quiet and unlike other electric pencil sharpeners I don't feel as if I'm going to break it as it seems a little sturdier than the one it is replacing. Hopefully, this will be the last pencil sharpener I have to acquire in my lifetime! It worked great for the first pencil but died as soon as I stuck in the second. This pencil sharpener leaves the pencils looking how they do out of the box when you purchase pre-sharpened pencils. You don't have to worry about over-sharpening and wasting some of your pencils.Size Option- This pencil sharpener sharpens several different sizes of pencils.Large Container for the shavings- The part that holds all the pencil shavings is really large for a pencil sharpener. I would HIGHLY recommend this pencil sharpener. This pencil sharpener is perfect for people with kids! We have our old faithful manual pencil sharpener screwed into the wall in the garage but this one is now the one we use and hopefully it will last longer than most other electric sharpeners. It quickly sharpens your pencil and stops automatically at just the right moment, leaving the pencil sharp with no waste. One pencil I tried had the sharp tip in the wood rather than the lead, but after looking closely I realized the pencil was made wrong with the lead to one side. It also provides a nice even point so my pencil points havent been breaking off. This is really a great pencil sharpener and I highly recommend it for any household. Sharpens pretty fast and stops when it's done and the pencil has a needle sharp point on it. I replaced my Panasonic Auto Stop pencil sharpener with this one. Auto-stop basically eats a good 3/16 to 1/4" more of your pencil each time you sharpenThe other issue is that it does not sharpen short pencils. This has become my favorite go-to electric pencil sharpener!I
