First, they use a simple suction cup to attach to any flat surface;  however, while the cup keeps the dispenser in place when you lift straight up to retrieve a piece of tape, it does nothing to keep it from sliding back and forth. However, if I pulled quickly, the suction held most of the time. I feel this could be improved on by creating better suction and also by making these deskgrip's refillable--which currently they are not.The value you receive from purchasing these tape dispensers and strips for gift wrapping or other jobs is convenience not cost savings. [+] The suction cup disks are deceptively functional.------------- The Cons -------------[-] The precut strips work on a pull-one-out-the-next-one-is-automatically-read-to-go way that gets a little thrown off if you don't start it off right from the first strip. It adheres with suction to smooth surfaces. I expected a suction type adhesion to the table top but it actually moves all over the table. The suction cup is unique: It holds the dispenser on the table so you can pull the tape off, but it can still move freely over the surface of the table, so you can drag it closer or push it out of the way easily. It is not a suction cup or a heavy object, but some new ingenius suction mechanism holds it down. The suction pad on the bottom is so much better than I expected. Cool.The Desktop Dispenser has a suction pad that seems like magic.

The suction pad held quite nicely on my kitchen counter-top (Corian), but virtually worthless on any wood surface I've tested it on.

At first I thought that it would need to  press down to make the "suction" work but not at all.

The suction material is very flexible and has a matte texture vs. a rubbery-smooth texture you'd expect from a regular suction cup.
