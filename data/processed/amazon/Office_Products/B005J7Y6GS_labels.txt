Up to 50 labels can be stored in memory, making it easy to reprint commonly used labels.My only issue with the LW-400 (so far at least) is with the batteries. Instead of seeing tiny, impossible to read printed labels, each bottle is marked clearly in large letters:  "Aspirin," "Diazide," etc. It is very easy to create simple labels and we haven't had any problem with it in that respect but allow me to make some observations.When I first started using it i was confused by the controls. Additionally, you can save up to 50 different labels if needed. The labels are just as readable from across the room as the Dymo at the 24 point size, without reflecting too much glare from the laminate surface. The oldest labels I applied a month ago have not peeled. It makes the labels look really professional and easy to read.The label cutter allows for a nice cutting before and after the content of the label and is easy to use.I was able to test this label printer with various cartridges, which contain both the label strips and ink cartridges.I was able to test this label maker with1/2" wide labelsBlack on WhiteBlack on Blue (iron-on)3/4" wide labelsBlack on ClearGlow in the Dark yellow (black ink)Black on Matte SilverGold on BlackBlack on Neon OrangeAll of the cartridges worked beautifully and were easy to read and use. It makes very neat, legible labels that withstand multiple runs through the dishwasher. It prints labels fairly quickly, and does not leave a lot of waste. I had a Brother P-touch before this and I hated how much I ended up trimming the labels off to make them fit. That said, I really like the labels that you can make with it. The labels came in a variety of sizes and colors and were easy to peel and place. The labels also work very well on various materials such as paper, plastic, and metals.- easy to read backlit display- quick tips conveniently printed on the back of the printer for easy referenceThe only drawback is that the AC adapter is optional whereas the P-touch comes with one included.I really enjoy using this label printer for my day-to-day labeling tasks The LW-300 can store up to 30 labels while the LW-400 can store up to 50 labels.3. Not to mention, the labels that this spits out are pretty fancy-looking. My labels are now all so fancy, and very  nice to look at. The labels look pretty strongly aliased (blocky), but what's even more surprising, is how the aliasing looks "wavy" or irregular - like an aliased font viewed through a hot-day-on-an-asphalt-road mirage. It also saves labels in the cutting process; other machines leave an inch or more of empty space on either side of labels; this model cuts very close. But I can get by without making labels, and so I have just put this product away and not bought any replacement tapes/labels. If you make some labels frequently, they can be saved in the device. The basic labels are comparable to my old unit. I just think that is worth noting.Finally the labels are affordable. There are labels available for the Epson printer that will stick to them, wrap around and stay in place. Epson iron-on labels fill the bill. You can do glow-in-the-dark labels festooned with creepy Halloween ghosts and goblins for that upcoming holiday, or pretty script labels for gifts and Christmas presents. The labels come out with perfect margins on all sides and the cutter is inside the unit so it's safe for the klutzes too. Can store labels you make so you can easily print them again laterAnyway, the only thing I could even think about being better is if they offered a heat shrink tube cartridge for wires and such, but that in no way takes away from this incredibly useful label printer. It will format your labels so that they become either index tabs, cable flag labels, cable wrapped labels, or even barcode labels. Regarding the LW-400, I found it to be less intuitive to use; I couldn't just pick it up and make labels. Once I made a few labels, it was easier but just not as easy as a P-touch. The labels for this Epson model don't have that issue... it's appreciated.If for some reason I ever had to buy a new label maker (or myself or for someone else), my first choice would be the Epson LabelWorks LW-400 Label Maker. I need labels made fast so that I can organize my life.

If there are labels you use often, you can save up to fifty of them.

I kept printing labels while trying various combinations to figure out how to accomplish that format.

If your labels are short (say 2", for file folders) then  of the tape is wasted!!!
