They work great as return address labels. Compared to alternative return shipping methods they are like the Taj Mahal of labels. I create my own return labels with these, but have also used these labels to identify cell phone chargers and other small appliances chargers etc and they work perfectly for this use.My wife also keeps one sheet to label potted plants and to add 'toss out' dates to left-overs she puts in the refrigerator (helps her remember how long things have been in there and when to dispose of them! I have a return address stamp, and use that rather than my printer for doing return addresses on my letters / bills. 3M return address labels are really, really nice. I was getting tired of writing my return address on countless envelopes. 3M Permanent Adhesive return address labels are a good alternative to Avery. They are what they are and can be used for only that purpose - return address labels.In the modern office environment, products (like people) that have multiple and varied uses are highly valued. I particularly like making my own return address labels with cute art without having to have 5 million of the same design. Good for return address labeling but not as good for shipping labels. The 3m return address labels are nice quality and easy to use, both in your printer, and mailings. These 3M return address labels really do have permanent adhesive. 3M's return address labels are just what you'd want in printable return address labels. These return address labels are easy to print and there are many on one page. They are advertised as return address labels but do not allow you to include your name in the return address. I ordered these because I wanted to have stick on return address labels. If you are looking for a decent return address label, they are just as good as most other 3M products, and are sufficiently sticky. If I set my return address at font size 8, then there is no overage to other labels. They are great for return labels of course and you get your money's worth with this quality item as they do stick permanently. They remind me of the small return address labels you get in exchange for donations to non-profit organizations. These return address labels work quite well. These are return address labels, and despite being labeled for laser printers, you can use them in an ink jet printer as well.The quick lift feature is very nice, I have had labels that just would not let go of their paper. It's difficult to get overly enthusiastic about return address labels, but it's nice to be able to produce your own instead of relying on the seemingly endless supply of "here's a return address label to use, now give me money please" labels.They're very convenient to use, and the printing works just great. These return address labels are just what they claim to be:  good labels that you can use with your computer system, labels that have a good adhesive, and you can use the "easy peel" function, or just peel them off one at a time. The 3M Permanent Adhesive Labels are the perfect return labels. It's nice not having to handwrite my return address on mailings.The labels easily peel off the backing and stick firmly to envelopes and other paper material. I particularly like return address size. If you like personalized return address labels for letters, cards, invitations, etc., but don't want to spend a lot of money ordering labels from a print shop, these 3M Return Address Labels are an excellent do-it-yourself alternative.Yes, they are small, but I found them to be about the same size as the custom-printed return address labels I've ordered in the past. These are return address labels, meant to be used for letters, cards, invitations, and other correspondence of that nature. I generally like my return lables to be a little larger--these are just barely enough for return address, but no name.While there are many lables to one pack, I'd have rather sacrificed a few lables to make them a bit larger.That said, I find that though they are a bit too small for return addresses, they are perfect for indexed folders, so it's not a total loss.Make sure you want labels this small if you're going to use them for return addresses--it's not impossible, but you will be using a small font, and probably omitting your name from the return address.
