I could do this on my own with regular folders with a pair of scissors! The Smead Super Tab folders are indeed folders with a large tab. All folders should come with tabs this size.What I did not like was the folder construction. The folders are like most of their kind, flimsy. Flimsy folders no.AD2 I have a p-touch and label all of my folders with it because I prefer the uniform look of printed labels. The folders are not as thick as I expected but will hold up to typical use. That's important to me and sets these folders apart from the others. Judging these manila folders reveals that they are much like any other in terms of overall size and durability. I got these folders because I have a habit of writing on my folders with marker instead of pen. I'm happy with these folders and will order some. I think we'll be quite happy with these folders. When I put my regular folders next to one of these, both with paper in them, I have exactly the same amount of space to write a heading on the tab.Otherwise, these are perfectly great folders for normal use. These are very lightweight, thin folders with one unique feature. Thin folders are fine for storage when you don't use them often or load 'em up. These SuperTab folders will be life-changing. When I saw the Smead SuperTab folders, I ordered them in hopes that my labels would fit and they do! I love these folders! Don't hesitate to purchase these folders. These folders are exactly as described... the tab area where you write the contents of the folder are nearly twice as large as on standard folders. They're file folders. These folders are fine and work as well as others Manila folders I have bought in the past. I found that these folders are the same as regular ones, just with the larger opening. The new Smead SuperTab letter-sized folders are identical to regular manila folders, except in one respect--the tab on top of the folder (where you write or attach a label) is much larger than on an ordinary folder. The folders are sturdy and are packaged in a box of 100.

The folders are otherwise fine, but the SuperTab feature is not a real innovation.

Ok, they're "SuperTab" folders, which means they've got more room in the label area, if you want to use two file folder labels, or maybe address labels.

These are good folders and sturdy like they'll last eternally (they'd better, I never clean out my files) and they do have a large tab.
