It is Epson ink, not as over priced as other printer ink, I can only assume that if I bought it I must have liked it since I have no bad memories of it. This ink has never failed. It is an ink cartridge replacement so what is there to say. I was shocked that the Epson ink for my Workforce 840 is so expensive. The ink is great. I don't find Epson ink any more expensive than other OEM ink. There isn't too much to say about this ink. I bought this ink cartridge to get some black ink for my Epson Workforce 545 ASAP. It's just ink, after all.

I received this ink with an Epson 845 printer.It works fine and I would recommend it.I'm sorry people have been told that they can use this ink in other printers or that it was overpriced compared to what you pay from Epson, but that's not what people here are looking for.Review readers want to know if the product is any good, and yes, it is.

The ink seems to be comparably priced with others on the market, but this particular type of ink, the DURAbrite, seems to print a bit clearer (less bleeding) and it dries instantly.

This is good ink, it's very cheap and it works great.
