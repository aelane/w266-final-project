This is my third and (I am hoping) my last laminator. This laminator heated up very quickly as promised and laminated quickly as well. Decent laminator. I had previously purchased another laminator that did not last me over a week. I've always wanted a personal laminator at home for those small project that often involve my children's artwork. It is a warm laminator, so be careful using around children. This Swingline laminator seals well and I haven't run into any problems with the pages I've laminated coming apart. If your looking for a laminator that small in size but works like a large one, this Swingline is a great choice. I have another laminator of the same size made by Amazon Basics. This laminator has a beep to let you know when it is ready (which is very nice!) That is why I wanted to review this laminator. They didn't work well with the Amazon Basics laminator, but they worked great with this laminator.So, if you choose to go the swingline route, I'd definitely recommend getting the pockets to match.One of the other reviews mentioned pockets getting stuck and needing to clean the rollers. I've had my $19 Amazon Basics laminator for six months and I have laminated a lot of different pieces in it over that time for my homeschooling. This one uses fairly thin laminator pouches. The new laminator is lighter but seems to run a little warmer than the older version. I have one other laminator that I've used previously to this one. This laminator is SO EASY TO USE!! It was super easy to feed the laminator pouches through the machine and get a nice product. I bought a laminator about 4 months ago and I wanted to laminate my recipes. This laminator does what it says. This new laminator will be a replacement for our six year old GBC laminator that just started to malfunction (rolling pages into the unit). I've never owned a laminator so I can't compare this to anything but I'm very satisfied with the quality of the laminations. A laminator is one of those things you might not need all the time but when you do it's nice to have. I own a Purple Cow laminator that I use for my scout pack and this one is just as good if not better. I replaced my very old laminator with  this one. This is by far the best laminator I've ever owned. I'm very pleased with my new Swingline 9&#34; laminator. Compared to the other laminator we have, this one heats up in one minute or less. I ran them through the laminator. This is a VERY easy-to-use laminator that does a great job.To use, you simply plug it in, wait until it warms up (about 2 minutes), put your document into a laminating pouch, and insert. I needed a new laminator since my previous one was no longer with us, [R.I.P.]. I just received my laminator and tried it as soon as it got here. But this laminator is so easy to use, I would use the word effortless. The laminator is easily repacked (simple packing) and the box has a carrying handle that lies flat when not in use. It's perfect for storing the laminator dust-free and easily stored on the shelf.I looked on the Swingline website, and the 3100L is made solely for laminating plastic pouches. The Swingline GBC Fusion 5000L laminator is pretty much top of the line. very nice laminator, warms up quickly, works well. This is a nice laminator with some good features. When I unboxed the laminator, I was pleased with the small, slim design and fairly footprint.I plugged the unit it, set it to the 3 mil setting, and started the stop watch. The laminator is quite silent to operate.I timed how long it took the machine to do a letter sized laminate pouch. The laminator warmed up as advertised and was ready to go after about 1 minute. The 1000L is a wonderful and inexpensive laminator. All you have to do is plug this little laminator in, wait about four minutes for the green light to come on, and laminate away. This laminator works quickly and efficiently. I wasn't sure if this laminator from Swingline would be better than the one I've been using so I couldn't wait to laminate something so I could try it out. Like my other laminator, this one has two different thickness settings which is great for when you're laminating layered items. With my other laminator I often have to send crafts like this through the machine a second or third time, but this one was one and done.Overall, I think it's a good laminator. The laminator is easy to set up and use and works perfectly. This laminator is the low volume unit for home use. The laminator will then automatically feed the sheet through at a slow pace until the process is completed. Overall I'm pretty satisfied with the laminator. I have another laminator (different brand) that is heavier, bulkier, and takes longer to heat up to use. I have not had to use this yet because the laminator ran perfectly, but it sounds helpfulIn the box:* Swingline 1100L 9" laminator* Instruction bookletThe 1100L does not come with any sample pouches, so if this is your first laminator then you will need to pick some up to use it. Overall, I found this to be a good casual laminator for small projects. The laminator heats up fast ~2 minutes. The laminator does well sealing the pages. I wanted a laminator for my home office and was grateful that I was offered this one. This laminator has worked out really well for me. This is my very first laminator. If you're looking for an inexpensive laminator that doesn't take up a lot of space then I highly recommend purchasing this one. Fortunately the laminator sensed and reversed the feed so my picture didn't get destroyed by the folds that would have followed.So far, it is a really simple to use unit that would work well for a small office or individual use. Great little laminator. I got this laminator to preserve my girls honors and awards from elementary school. I use my Swingline laminator on a series of fun playing cards I've been creating for friends and family, a collection of letters I want to preserve and a collection of note-card recipes for my wife.In a nutshell:Pros:* It warms up fast - as advertised in about four minutes. This laminator is just perfect for laminating kids art works, cards, absolutely anything that you want to preserve. It is fairly small for a laminator, and so it is very handy to keep around for laminating important docuements. and feeding it into the laminator. This a no-hassle laminator that's easy to use and that produces high quality results. I'm not exactly a laminator expert but was very pleased with how easy to use the Swingline was. I have a Fellowes laminator at home and got this one to use at work. In comparing this laminator to my current laminator, a Scotch TL901, it came up lacking and the Scotch laminator was significantly less expensive than this one.This laminator has no tray and on all the test results, the finished product came out either wrinkled or curled even though it was flat going in. We have an expensive laminator at work that can handle big jobs - as long as you know what you're doing and are very careful about loading it correctly and keeping the temperature in the correct range for the film thickness. This Swingline 1703072 9" laminator seemed like it would be way too cheap to actually get the job done, but it was worth a shot.The first thing I noticed when unboxing this thing was its light weight and tiny footprint. This laminator is no exception. This is a nice laminator, but does the extra cost worth it when compared to say the Scotch brand. This is a one-step laminator; I just plugged this little gizmo and it worked. This is a good, no-frills laminator. For me this laminator takes a little under five minutes to get warm enough to use, it beeps to tell you when it is ready. I've been pretty pleased with this laminator. It heats up as advertised, which is significantly more quickly than our Fellowes laminator that is a year or two old. I have not had any 'jams' so far, but don't doubt that this smart laminator could handle one if the need arose. I am not sure why, but it did and I had to reverse the laminator ... and the items were destroyed. This laminator really saves me on taking to time to reprint the same forms again and again--I just laminate the blank sheet and use a regular marker to check off what I need and what needs to get done, then, just wipe it off (great with coupons too).As a working mother of three, I LOVE little things like this that can cut down my time so that I can spend more time with my family.Have fun!RLM This is the first laminator I have owned so I am still getting the hang of things. This lightweight, compact laminator does an incredible job.With only five minutes to heat up, the Swingline is dummy proof and comes with simple one page instructions. This is the first laminator I have used, so I do not have anything to compare it to. I bought a laminator a couple of years after and hated the results... the film took away from the vivid colors of the pictures being laminated and they always had a bit of a 'wrinkle' to them that never went away.That was quite a long time ago and after my wife had been requesting a laminator for our daughter's school projects, I winced at the thought. I'm reviewing the 9-inch personal laminator. So, I went and turned on the laminator and put the two printed sheets back to back in the pouch, went to brush my teeth and came back in time to see the green light come on. This 9" laminator is simple and functional. I love this Swingline laminator. It's very simple.The laminator can cover 13 inches per minute. The Swingline GCB Fusion 1100 is a nice laminator. If you've got $2000 to drop on a laminator, that is the way to go.

It does not measure up to my $30 Scotch laminator which is more versatile.

Since this laminator doesn't require a protective sleeve (which is real nice) you want to clean those rollers often to keep your laminator pouches from wrapping around the rollers.

I am very happy with this laminator.
