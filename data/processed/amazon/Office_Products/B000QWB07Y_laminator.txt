I really liked what I got with this laminator. I love this laminator! My old laminator did and those carriers were beginning to get bent and beat up. I was so excited to receive this laminator as I always find myself needing to laminate things and used to do it at work but am now retired and have no way. I was very excited to get this laminator from the Amazon Vine program. This laminator has been perfect for making permanent portable versions of the school calendar that we can keep in our wallet, cars, organizers etc. I've had this laminator for review for a short while. Compared to my Fellows laminator from Costco, this is much slower. I use a laminator at least a couple times/month (sometimes as often as a few times each week), and I'm REALLY happy with this. The laminator works well enough as advertised. This laminator only handles 3 mil sheets. The laminator is convenient, super easy to use, and perfect for home use. The laminator worked flawlessly. I regularly use a GBC Brand laminator to mint items like parking, media and access passes that need waterproofing. Once heated up, the laminator stayed hot.I was pleased -- the initial go around -- that it laminated documents well the first time with the Fellowes machine. With this handy little laminator, the only thing that will keep me waiting is if I run out of pouches! I had been itching to buy a laminator for my at-home classroom. The laminator cooled down quickly and is small enough for me to store (unplugged, of course) on the top of my bookshelf.Overall I am very impressed, although I think for the price they could include a package of pouches to get you started.
