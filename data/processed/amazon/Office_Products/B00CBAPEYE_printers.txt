I have used several Epson printers over the past few years, including the WorkForce 845, WF-3520, and the XP-850. All my printers are rather large with the newest being only a year old. I have printers that cost four times a much as this one and this one runs circles around that one. Yes I know big printers have lock print, I usually think of it as I run out the door to grab a print job.Anyway, this printer works pretty well. However, one could buy three of the printers for what a year's worth of printing cartridges cost - even if, as is true in my case, one does minimal printing, all black and white. I also have other printers, so I use this one more for scanning than printing, so I'm going to stick to the "real" Epson ink. Like most printers, it comes with some bloatware (you have to check off that you do NOT want it to install Ask as your default toolbar, and that you don't want "special offers," assuming you don't).But the nitty gritty of it is this: Epson does a better job printing photos than my former go-to line, the Canon Pixmas. HInt...you're not supposed to think these cheap printers are meant to last a lifetime. Lot's of printers are often on sale on Amazon. Epson makes similar printers that offer additional features such as faxing and CD printing, but if you don't need the extras then this one is worth considering.This printer uses DURABrite Ultra instant-dry ink cartridges. I have used Epson printers for years with varying degrees of satisfaction. I wish all printers were this easy to set up and operate.One of the best aspects of this printer is the ink cartridges, which are reasonably priced. I'm getting really tired of printers that don't come with a cable.

Unlike some printers I've had in the past, you can replace only the ink cartridge color you need.

When compared to other printers, the inks are perhaps the most expensive that I've seen in 2013 (even among other Epson printers, which always tend to be a bit costly in the ink department).

I have five printers and use each of them usually for a specific purpose.
