The 2 desk-grip dispensers work quite interestingly. You get TWO double dispensers, TWO hand dispensers, and FOUR EXTRA precut tapes, at a reasonable price. These have both wrist dispensers and flat surface dispensers (which seems to stick well enough) which put the tape in the right place at the right time. These dispensers prevent a lot of waste and can be refilled.Another nice thing about this tape is the type of tape. The "Handband" dispensers have even less of a general use application and would only be helpful if you were doing ALOT of taping at once (my wife used one while wrapping presents). I doubt I would buy the Handband dispensers separately and/or use them very often.Overall this is a good product for the right tasks. These dispensers are an interesting idea in search of a problem. The two mobile dispensers strap across the back of your hand, allowing you to pull off uniform 2" pieces of tape while not letting go of the package. Plus, unlike the hand-held dispensers, these are not refillable. After using the dispensers that attach to your hand, I do prefer my old weighted down tape dispenser for wrapping gifts, etc. These Scotch dispensers are a fantastic idea and are very convenient. however, these dispensers won major points for allowing my 5yo boys to 'wrap' a gift for the family with little intervention on my part. Both dispensers are also wonderful and they've been very helpful this holiday season.Handband Dispenser* This has a few different ways to wear it: on the wrist like a watch, on the hand below fingers or even on or around the knuckles, depending on what the user would prefer. It's nice that these dispensers hold two packets of tape.The Refill Packs- Believe it or not, I've used pretty much all my packets of tape. Two of the dispensers are for placing on the desk (they stay nicely on the dining table, unfortunately wont sit/grip well on a rug); Two of the dispensers have an elastic band that can hold the dispenser unintrusively on the back of your palm. I almost broke one of the dispensers trying to open it. However, these dispensers are certainly useful in many situations and with a little improvement can be a five star product when used for the right purpose. I've already used these dispensers so many times. What fun it was to use these dispensers to wrap the gifts! These dispensers mostly deliver, although there's room for improvement.First, the strap-on dispenser:  very comfortable, stays put, effective. Deskgrip dispensers are not refillable, but are each pre-loaded with two packs of tape. Both dispensers use the same pre-cut two inch pieces of tape. We've used the Deskgrip dispensers before, but this Christmas season gave us the chance to try the Pop-up Tape Handband dispenser. Two dispensers include an elastic band which can be placed on one's wrist, which makes life so much easier when one's hands are busy multitasking. The other two dispensers are also great because you can stick each on a flat surface to avoid motion of dispenser during use. These handy dispensers make using the tape easy. The little dispensers are perfect for the job and you'll never lose your traditional tape dispenser on a busy workspace again.The handband dispensers are plastic containers with a sliding door and elastic wrist-strap. These little dispensers hold small packs of pre-cut tape. These dispensers work great and are very convenient. I especially like the dispensers that are designed to wear on the wrist, since it prevents me from losing the tape in the midst of wrapping. Both dispensers really are a huge convenience for wrapping gifts, as they leave my hands free for folding paper and taping without fumbling with twisted tape on a tape roll.The second thing I noticed was how the children in our family love these dispensers! I think these dispensers would be great for wrapping gifts, as well as giving as gifts to children and the elderly!

And the dispensers are easy to fill (the refillable rectangular ones that you wear over your fingers that is, not the round ones you stick to a desk which are non-refillable)  and use.The bright colors cannot disguise the fact that it is impossibly nerdy to wear a Scotch tape dispenser.

The dispensers are not of high quality and I cannot say for what degree of usage they may last.

Initially, both wrist dispensers were extremely difficult to open; this may be a problem for anyone with arthritic hands.
