But last month's Ooma fees were only $4, compared with over $50 a month for C__cast, so who am I to complain? I pay less than $4 a month to Ooma in required "taxes" and 911 service. After the 12 month warranty is done, you cannot get the unit repaired. We've had this for a month now, connected in conjunction with the Ooma Linx. Without paying at least $4.00 a month you will find you have purchased a useless device (meaning a "brick" - techno parlance - for an electronic device that is as useless as a brick)! Now $4.00 a month is not much but why advertise OOMA as free????? Testing the Telo for a month, as long as the DSL was up (it would go down at least once a day, sometimes more) the quality of incoming and outgoing calls on the Telo was outstanding. we were paying close to $70 per month. At $50 a month for at&fee; , I am saving a lot of $$! When I signed up I used a free month of the premium services, which were great, included a second line, email alerts for voicemail, and many other great features, but for me, just looking to save money I stuck to the basic line, only a bit less than $4 per month.This products great when it comes to saving money and and having the ability to call nationwide for virtually nothing. I don't want to subscribe the $10 per month premier plan. Just be aware that the 2 month trial goes away when you sign up for premium--it does not get tacked on.

We waited a month before porting.

OOMA is also considerably cheaper than Vonage which charges about $25.00 a month PLUS taxes and fees of about $9.00 to $13.00 for their unlimited* USA/Canadian calling plan.

So Vonage really costs about $35.00 a month.
