I am an organizer freak people!!! This sturdy, pocket-plentiful organizer was a delight. For me, this organizer is the closest I have found for this purpose.It consists of individual manila-weight pocket pages. The organizer is really just a glorified notebook of sorts. This is a great small organizer, perfect for small projects, whether its a home improvement one or anything else. I'd have rathered they weren't there.I'd recommend the organizer for folks who need to track something over time that won't generate a ton of paperwork but that still needs to stay organized. I really love this organizer and use it for my bills. I'm not working, but I use this organizer to organize my home life. I really like this organizer. I really like this sturdy little organizer, and I find myself using it a lot for papers. This organizer helps me stay organized a save time. Moreover, if you want to reuse the organizer, just erase the notes inside. This is a very useful organizer.

The organizer fell from my desk to the floor along with an avalanche of large and small papers.
