The markers have (or at least start out) with a relatively fine line. These Sharpie markers will lend some fun to doodles or designs. These Sharpie markers work well on most surfaces with the exception of darker surfaces which their metallic color will work on. Regrettably, I would not recommend these permanent markers if you want to use them to overlap pencil lines. And, all of the permanent markers have a neatly pointed tip, which is useful for details. Other than that these are very average at best markers. These are great Sharpie markers for kids. The markers had a dry and almost powdery feel to them when I drew with them. )4) These markers are Permanent. These markers aren't for young children. Indeed, they're normal markers (in fact, using them as highliters can smear the printed text). So, decide why would you need neon-colored markers that glow under black light.I have one use: you want to make a poster that can glowin the dark. Being that they are sharpie and permanent markers makes them even better. The markers are permanent on most surfaces, they glide on easily, the lines are nice and sharp. These Sharpie markers have the same quality as all their other permanent markers, which is why I love them.The colors are very bright, as you would expect.

Paper obviously does well - and yes, they blead through like the black markers do so be careful of that.

The markers worked very well on the plastic surface of the headphones.

But then again these are really specialized markers and not your standard blacks that can be gotten for under a dollar.Thanks for reading!PS I wish I'd had these as a kid when I may have consumed substances that would make these sharpies a lot of fun.
