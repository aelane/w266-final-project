Also, that &#8220;oak&#8221; frame is really plastic, and the only other material reinforcing this thing is cardboard. The frame is also of okay quality and strong. But as the frame holds the cork a little bit away from the wall, the wall won't be marked. The frame is very nicey joined wood and will look nice almost anywhere. I like the nice, clean looking frame, although it isn't oak, it's faux wood grained plastic (I wasn't expecting real wood for this price either). The frame appears sturdy. The frame is solid, and it's not going to pull apart in ordinary use. The frame is only plastic, although it does resemble wood. It means that you can't nail into the frame. The frame is classic and looks nice. What makes it so light is the frame is made from plastic (painted to look like wood) and the cork board is extremely thin.When you push a 1/2&#34; pin through the board it feels like it passes through 3 different materials:  A cork veneer,  something that feels like Styrofoam, and then the particle board backing.

The frame is plastic (of course) and unfortunately the mounting stuff it comes with is not very useful/practical.

The frame measures 24 inches by 36 inches.

The frame on mine was cracked in 2 places upon arrival, which I blame less on the shipper and more on the flimsy material used to make it.
