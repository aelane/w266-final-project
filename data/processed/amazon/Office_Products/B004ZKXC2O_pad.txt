With this pad, I don't need to. The smaller pad is on top, and the pads get progressively larger. One pad can fill multiple uses. I used to always keep my Post-It pad in a drawer. Sometimes you need a small sticky pad and sometimes you need more space to write. I also like that the pad of notes has sizes to choose from all in one place. I was afraid the pad might fall apart when I ripped one of the sheets in the middle out but they stayed together very well. Its Great that this one pad has 5 diffrent colors and 5 diffrent sizes.They are pre-perforated so you can rip out any one from any level and/or go to any sheet size you want w/o having to use up the ones above  first.They go from all neon easy to see colors:Small Orange..YellowGreen/limeBlueXL Bright pink.Comes in a set of 150pages 30 of each color. But I am still finding this a useful pad to be kept by the phone. The pad is very attractive looking on a desk and hefty enough that it doesn't squirm away when writing on. I guess I'm used to scribbling on the pad, peeling off the note, and then slapping the note wherever it's going (a desk, window, document, forehead, etc. What makes these different is that they come in a pad with all different sizes and colors in one pad. All around messy.What I love the most about these is that they are set up like a little "pad" of paper and are about the same overall size (3 inches wide, 5 inches long), which means I can easily stash them in even the smallest handbag for quick jots, etc. Plus the pad holds everything together.My only con is the pricing (a bit steep for only 150 sheets) and that they are only sold separately. Just flip the pad to the color and size you want! The pad comes with 5 stepped sizes of sticky notes with easy tear perforations. The pad will tote easily in a purse, within a calendar, laptop bag, etc. The pad has a sturdy binding. I really like this handy little pad of sticky notes. The pad, which was made to stay together even when the middle sheets are removed is just a little too adhesive - it wants to stay together even when you need a single note.The idea is great, but the execution didn't quite make it. This makes it possible to write on the pad. Each separate pad is a different size and displays its own vivid color, making it easy to distinguish them and the colors are bright enough that you could practically find them in the dark, much less on a cluttered desk. They are all in one pad, in graduated sizes, each pad is about 1/2" larger than the one before it, so depending on what you are writing, you can decide on what sized piece of sticky notes you need, without having to have each pad separately, it's all on the same pad, but each sized note is in a different color, from a neon orange, which is the smallest sized sticky note, at 3" X 2.5", to the largest sticky note, which is a neon pink, and it's 3" X 4.5".The yellow sticky note is 3" X 3", the neon green sticky note is 3" X 3.5", the neon blue sticky note is 3" X 4".This is a good idea for someone who really uses sticky notes, in different sizes, but wants sticky notes in a more compact size, having them all at your fingertips. The pad is compact and easy to store in your desk.In one pad, you have the option of selecting any size stickem' note.It is well designed. Each pad is a different size. With this new pad from Avery, I can simply flip to the color I need, remove a sheet, and not have to hunt down the next color when I need it. What you're getting here is more like a sticky-note pad with five different colors and sizes. This pad has 5 sizes and it is easy to tear sheets from different parts of the stack (sheets that are different sizes). You don't need a different pad every time you'd like to change colors. I will definitely be buying another when this pad runs out.T
