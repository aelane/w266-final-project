For a basic printer, this is a pretty good one. The printer is also a back-loading printer. This great little wireless printer does all those things and more. It also, without asking, made this Epson printer my default printer. My previous printer was an Epson Workforce 325, and it was a nice little printer that fit most of my needs. This Epson printer is an improvement.Pluses over the Epson Workforce 325:1)  Smaller footprint. With my old printer, I had to look up the instructions every time I wanted to change the printer ink. This printer is a little more intuitive;3) Scan button is on the front of the printer, however, I still have to use my desktop icon to scan a document (really wanted the ability to hit the scan button & have the window open on my computer);4) Can choose to copy in either B&W; or Color;5)  Document feeder seems to work smoothly without jamming;6) Quicker printing & scanning;7) WiFi is easy to setup.Cons:1) Even though the scan button is on the front of the printer, I still have to use my desktop icon to scan a document (really wanted the ability to hit the scan button & have the window open on my computer);2) I wish that the end product on multiple pages of a scanned document would end up in 1 file rather than single pages which I then have to combine into a single document;3) Seems to slurp the ink more than my old printer. I am concerned that this printer is an ink hog.I fax documents, but use an online fax number, so I have no use for the fax portion of the machine.Overall, this Workfoce 2530 is a nice little machine that has a decent document feeder on it. I'm happy to say that my printer has been consistently running without any issues or problems since October. The printer will then recharge the cartridges, it takes a few minutes. I held off from getting a printer for a long time. This is a solid printer for the money and the ink cost isnt great which I like. )This printer would be a good choice for students and others who don't have the budget for a color laser 3-in-1. I was pleasantly surprised by this printer. The printer copies and scans quickly and the resulting images are almost identical to the original. Problem is now solved with this printer. This compact printer has all the features we could want on a home printer, is easy to use, and is delightfully compact. This is the 2nd Epson printer I've owned. If you plan to use the printer as a scanner, you will need to have a direct connection via USB cable to your PC. This is the first printer I have seen where the LCD display does not light up. Overall I am satisfied with this printer for its price and size. I like this printer for the price. The printer is actually pretty fast. I initially tried to set the printer up wirelessly on a network with a Cisco router and a latest generation iMac running OSX Lion. I believe the printer is rated to 9 ppm in B&W; and 4.5 ppm with color. I love that the printer has a document feeder, aiding in my ability to easily scan in multiple pages. At first I was a little disappointed the printer didn't have a USB option, as I've traditionally scanned in a document, put it on the USB thumb drive, and then inserted it into my computer. Like every other printer manufacturer, Epson makes a number of relatively inexpensive printers that chug expensive ink (in keeping with the "your first taste is free" business model). Configuring the printer on my Windows 7 and Windows XP computers was as simple as inserting the installation CD and following the onscreen prompts; my Windows 8 computers automatically detected it on my network and required no further setup at all.Print quality is excellent for documents and web pages. This may not be the printer for photographers and photography enthusiasts, but then you should be looking for a printer that uses at least five ink cartridges anyways. Setup was easy, though if you know what you're doing, I recommend connecting the printer to your wireless network BEFORE you install the software on CD to your PC - you can then just say "printer is already on network" when prompted during installation.I tested ALL advertised features (including AirPrint and send and receiving FAX) and was able to get them all working to varying degrees. I haven't had a printer for about 3-4 years now because it seemed easier and less costly to just email what I wanted printed to my local print shop or take it in on a storage device. So, I had to have another printer, which turned out to be aKodak ESP 2170 All-in-One Printer. This printer, tethered to my machine via USB, took 2.5 *minutes*. Epson never contacted me about ANY of this, and they've already received my returned printer, so they have no legal right to apply ANY charge, hold, or ANYTHING to my card!!! NEVER before have I owned a printer that simply WOULD NOT FUNCTION because ONE toner cartridge was empty. Every single other printer I've ever had has been able to be set, and function fully, on strictly grayscale printing, using strictly black ink. But to encounter a printer with a name that, prior to now, had seemed as reputable as Epson's once was for me, with all these fancy-schmancy bells and whistles, and find that I can't even update the firmware, complete a reinstall, or do anything else aside from scan, simply because ONE color of toner is OUT?!? !I will never again buy an Epson printer. *UPDATE 1*Now that I've owned this Epson printer for a while now, I can sincerely say that it's just as poor a value overall as the worst printer you might've encountered. It won't do it.If you've considered this printer, you've probably looked up the toner that goes with it. My printer has been insistently telling me for the last hour or so that it's out of magenta toner, and has turned itself offline, and WILL NOT PRINT, regardless of the fact that I've set my printer to print in GRAYSCALE ONLY. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *This is my first Epson printer, and it does a great job of creating high quality copies, scans, printouts, and faxes. This printer is compact in size and easy to set up. We use this printer in the kitchen because its size is ideal for our space (Our PC is a Vaio laptop running Windows 7.Pros:1. It takes the printer a bit of time to warm up when I turn it on.2. The printer does not allow you to use symbols when entering the wireless modem password. I wanted a wireless printer that I could put into my closet (so I wouldn't need to make room and see it in my bedroom). This printer will print from most of your devices and it does a good job. This is not a great printer for photos. The entire printer weighs less than 13 pounds and you can put it almost anywhere.....even in a closet.The trays feel a bit cheap, much like the 7510, but so far they have both held up. It is a printer - all programs associated with it should remain completely unnoticed until someone wants to print something. Y can't I use it as a printer? Just setup the printer to connect to Google and forget about it! Otherwise, this printer will probably provide most of what most home users need -- at a fraction of the cost of some of other brands! This printer is serving me well! This is the third Epson printer I have owned, and, given the positive experiences, I probably will not ever use another brand of personal photo printer. This printer installed easily, prints great photos and other documents, and scans perfectly. For me, this is a perfect printer. The printer has all the features needed in the home. This Epson Workforce WF-2530 printer is great if you want to give up zero functionality while keeping within budget. Overall I thougnt thge Epson WorkForce WF-2530 is a good printer for home use.I tried all the features successfully.WiFi- found my network and setup easily.Scanner- worked fine on both documents and pictures.Copier- worked fine in black/white and color.Tablet/Phone(iPad/iPhone) found printer quickly and printed fine (fav feature).Cartridges: 4 Small Epson colored cartridges. EPSON has created the most affordable all in one printer for your home office. If you're looking for the best printer that will go easy on your wallet this is it. I was very excited to try out this printer. I have another Epson printer (Epson Stylus NX430), so I was able to compare the two. I received the printer packed in another box for which I give Amazon kudos, as the printer was left on my doorstep.The printer came in its box with recyclable materials making it easy to dispose of them.It had an quick guide, CD with drivers and inks.I plugged the printer and sent a word document from my laptop. I found the printer through the windows print menu.

This particular printer has been a stable little workhorse, cranking out really great looking prints when I need it to....and being sparing on the ink supply for text.Unlike some other reviewers...I wanted to put it to the test for MONTHS to see how well she fared.

I don't think it's fair to use a printer for a day (or a week) and give it 5 stars.

Typically a printer will go gangbusters for a short period then go to Hell later if something's wrong.
