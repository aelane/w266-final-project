These shipping labels are fantastic! These shipping labels are incredibly convenient; the labels are detachable (two to a page), so you can avoid wasting labels on sites that print a label on the top of the page and a shipping receipt on the bottom. I used this shipping label on USPS Click n Ship. The shipping label features Avery's "TrueBlock" technology, which guarantees that it covers everything underneath (think an existing shipping label when you are reusing a box). )The shipping label is 5 1/16" x 7 5/8" in size and is suitable for [...] online postage, USPS Click-N-Ship, UPS, eBay & PayPal online postage, and possibly many more other services. However, be ware that if you use multiple shipping company you need to be careful when you insert the sheets. I use Paypal shipping and it is a perfect fit.I have been using plain paper and then clear tape over it but now I am spoiled. These shipping labels are no exception -- they are thick and using the "TrueBlock" technology are very opaque and cover any existing markings on packages. I also feel more secure having my shipping labels covered in some type of plastic -- especially if water smears an inkjet printed label. You can print your own shipping labels, using these white shipping labels with paper receipts. Avery makes great shipping labels and this one is also top notch. This is my favorite shipping label to use when shipping products. The shipping labels you can print using their website are designed to be printed on standard paper, folded in half, and slipped into clear, adhesive envelopes. Specifically, printing a shipping label and attaching it on a box is a quite cumbersome job to me. Basically all of the major shipping alternatives (UPS, USPS, etc) have a similar format for their pre-printed labels - half a sheet of standard copier paper.What I did before this was to simply print to a sheet of paper, tear in half with a straight edge, and then use clear packing tape to attach to the package.

Though I still take out as much as I can of the old shipping labels, I don't have to do so as much since the TrueBlock technology really does work in blocking out the old label when applying the new one on top.Also, I don't really use receipts as much since I print packing slips and keep track of the finances online, but I'm sure they would come in handy for someone opting for this Avery set.After ordering this set and Avery's 8127, I found that this one sticks better.

These shipping labels work well for online mailing label printing from USPS, Paypal, FedEX and UPS.

I don't do very much shipping, I sell the occasional item on Amazon Marketplace and that's about it.
