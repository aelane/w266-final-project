The board I purchased was packed better and had no damage. Otherwise, this is a nice little board with much going for it. This board is very good quality and the size is generous. The board is also of decent size, but not too big to occupy too much of wall space. Our board is loaded down and still sturdy. The board is also quite light weight so it is easily movable! This board is just the right size. And very easy to bot up nice board! My old board is thick and has a real oak frame. You can cover the entire board with the material of your choice, before mounting. I place cork board in my hallways like frames and display my children's art work. This is a large board, poster sized, with a solid piece of cork surrounded by a wood frame. My previous board was much smaller and had paper on top of paper on top of paper, etc. Other than that, I find this board to be very usable and the cork seems sturdy like it'll last through lots of times of pushing tacks into it.One last thing is I like that the frame is smooth without any ridges. My last board had decorative ridges that were fairly narrow in width and it was a pain to try to dust in the ridges. The board comes with two screws, two wall anchors, and two metal attachment tabs. A serviceable board at a good price. it's a nice board and enough space. The board arrived promptly in a slightly over-sized cardboard box with little packing material. The board we received was slightly warped and would have benefited from a fastener at the bottom to keep board snug against the wall. It's a large, durable, bulletin board that adequately serves its purpose for a reasonable price to boot. The board is super lightweight and easy to move if needed. This is handy for me because I&#8217;m using the board to hide a cubby-hole in my wall that holds the cable modem and a spider web of wires.

The board is very light and thin; push pins will pass all the way through the board.

This board with its light oak frame can be an attractive addition to any office space, but our case we hung it in our daughter's bedroom.The included hanging hardware was easy to work with, and easily hung.

It is a very nice, well made bulletin board.
