All in all, a nice and simple product. Wonderful product for the price. Overall, a nice product and something to think about if you are having wrist issues and use a mouse. It's alos a 3M product, which means it's great quality. This new 3M mousepad product makes it more comfortable to move your mouse ! It seems to be a quality product that will last for a long time. This 3M product is an exceptional value.The gelpad wristrest takes pressure off the joint, making for hours of comfortable use. Overall, this product is far superior to the "office supply mega store" version I was using before. "I'm more than pleased with this product. Just like this product's matching keyboard wrist rest (3M(TM) Wrist Rest for Keyboard, Antimicrobial, Gel, Large Size, Black), I found the wrist rest on this mouse mad way too hard.While both products appear to be well made, the padding on them are just not soft enough for me. I've only had the product for a few days, but I am impressed by the quality of the product so far. I would highly recommend this product. I highly recommend this product.

I waited to review this product until I had gone through 4 recharging cycles just to be sure it would or would not make a difference.My Logitech MX 1100 is a heavy mouse and the slick surface on the 3M pad makes maneuvering much easier than on a fabric pad, a big plus for the 3M surface.The edges on this pad are slightly curled, that was not a problem on my previous 3M pad.

The last 3M product I reviewed was horrible, but this Gel Mousepad Wrist Rest fares much better.Obviously, it's far pricier than a standard pad, and that may put many users off.

Firstly this is a solid product - the quality seems nice and high.
