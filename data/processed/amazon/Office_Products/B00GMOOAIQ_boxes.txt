These boxes are generously sized but relatively lightweight... perfect for packing bulky items like towels, blankets, and kids toys, but not sturdy enough for heavy stuff like books or dishes. These boxes hold a lot so if you have heavy items, you have to distribute them between several boxes and alternate with lighter items. Having all the boxes the same size makes it easier to determine the space needed to transport them.They arrived in a large flat box (which in itself is handy because I had a large framed map that require a container just that size) and they are clean and free from corner bumps and tears.I have some light but bulky items I need to ship and these are perfectly sized for 2 pillows and a large down comforter which otherwise would have had to have been shipped in separate boxes. Be sure to buy some smaller boxes for heavier items, and get some packing tape as well to go along with it. You get 10 big boxes which comes out to about three bucks each. Overall the boxes are sturdy and well constructed, so it'll hold up well. These boxes are sturdy enough for shipping via Amtrak -- I am moving to Hollywood and they will have to make it across the entire country. If you're going to pay for boxes, you might as well buy these, if you want them delivered to your house.Long way from the old days when I used to scrounge up boxes for free by going to liquor stores etc. Using smaller boxes allows you to pack things of a similar nature together without having to worry about it becoming too heavy. If you use bigger boxes, sure, you can put more into them, but you have to mix towels with books to keep the weight down. Ultimately, you can get so many more boxes in the same amount of space if they are all of consistent sizes.All this said, these boxes, and the banker's boxes by the same company are perfect for smart movers. These SmoothMove boxes were strong, supportive and a perfect size for many household items. We would have ordered more of these boxes had we known how good they would be. The boxes supplied by the moving company were of significantly lower quality but were also less expensive. We would highly recommend using these SmoothMove boxes for all the items of appropriate size, but using cheaper boxes for items that are less likely to be damaged. These boxes are the perfect size for moving and are very durable for the move. I highly recommend these boxes. These are more expensive than comparable boxes available at Home Depot though. The 10 boxes were packaged in a 40&#34; x 36&#34; shipping box. I compared these boxes to Uhaul and Home Depot boxes and the construction of the SmoothMove box is definitely lighter than those. I am unsure why they are labeled as such?They are boxes, you build them and put stuff inside of them. These are great boxes for moving, Bankers Box brand makes high quality sturdy boxes, and I have had nothing but good quality from their SmoothMove line. We do not care much for labeling directly onto the boxes, for our old and tried paper with a scotch tape allows to describe itemized contents, while at the same time, if they arrive in good shape, to remove the paper and be able to use them again as many times as allowed.The size is ideal for many items that are not top heavy, and once you think about it, it does become easier to load and unload this size of box. These boxes work wonderfully. Apparently Amazon double boxes everything, even boxes. And inside there were these 10 boxes banded together. If the boxes are going into storage, remember to write the content description on all four sides. As it happens, we are moving and have bought more boxes since. The boxes were delivered well packaged and were very easy to set up. these are good boxes for moving. These boxes hold up well to packing and I think they are a great size - not too big, not to small. Comparatively, these boxes are about average. I used these boxes for dishes, bathroom supplies, books, and DVDs without any problems. Once assembled and taped, these are good general boxes for your "stuff," whether it's for storage, moving across town or to the other side of the country.My reference above to "no strange unidentifiable insects in the carton" has to do with personal experience where I picked up a pack of ten smaller boxes locally for a bargain price. Big, sturdy boxes! These boxes are not the best for moving. In all, we ended up scrapping only a single lamp.Usually we save our moving boxes&#8230;cut them down, fold them up, and then hand them off to the next person we know who is moving. Smart Cars don't tote boxes. We've been purchasing the Home Depot boxes for a little over a dollar each. These boxes are the same size as the Home Depot medium boxes.While these are boxes and pack things just fine, they are a bit on the expensive side. If you are looking for moving boxes, the SmoothMove Bankers box offers quality construction. Finally, get a few extra large boxes for large pots/pans, large picture frames, large platters, etc. Banana boxes from the grocery store are great for this (and they're free).However... these medium moving boxes are $3 each on Amazon (10 for $30). The boxes at Home Depot are recycled, same as these.So I think these are great. These boxes are larger than your standard box, are relatively well made (way better than shipping boxes) and are very square. This makes these boxes great for storing clothes, stuffed animals, pictures, large books, etc, anything that needs to be packed but isn't super &#34;dense&#34; in weight. But I wouldn't use these larger boxes for that purpose. These boxes are a nice size and are made sturdy to hold all household items&#8212;except heavy electric appliances, such as bulky Crockpots, rice cookers, microwaves, etc. Otherwise, these boxes hold it all. I'm impressed with these sturdy boxes, and I'll be putting them to good use.FIVE STARS! Great boxes. These &#34;moving boxes&#34; are said to be suitable for &#34;mid-weight&#34; items, but I wouldn't trust them for electronics or small appliances, as they are just not sturdy enough. Moreover, they are fairly expensive for what they are; I've seen better and cheaper boxes sold locally. I would consider these boxes best suited for clothing and similar items- you need something sturdier for anything that's breakable. It seems odd somehow to purchase boxes online, but suppose that is how things work anymore. These boxes come flattened (of course) in yet another large carton. The boxes seem nice and sturdy, and of a good size for general moving, which, unfortunately, we are going to have to do again soon. Hopefully, these nice boxes will help for a smooth transition. These boxes were standard moving box quality. Also, buying these boxes is better than digging through grocery store trash cans for boxes they're throwing away. As far as moving boxes go, these are an excellent size (not too big so they get too heavy! And with boxes this large, I did not fill them to the top with books; I went about halfway up and then tossed in other things, like a globe or throw pillows.The medium boxes I ordered, on the other hand, almost put themselves together, and held almost as much. I recently moved, and these boxes were the ideal size - big enough to fit most item sizes, but not big enough to become too heavy to lift safely.I
