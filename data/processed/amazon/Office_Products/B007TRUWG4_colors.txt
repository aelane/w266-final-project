Great colors, easy to use, and even better, double erasers on each one. I wonder if they come in more manly colors. The colors of the pencil shells is not the greatest, unless you like that funky 80s look, but I really couldn't care, I am not out to impress with what my pencils look like. I love the bright colors. The 4 different colors that the pencil comes in are super attractive as well. There are four of them in the colors purple, orange, blue and yellow. The colors are rich and the pencils work well. Attractive colors and easy to use. The colors remind me of clear Lego pieces, and a four pack is plenty to share with friends! The colors are a transparent neon, and very bright. The colors of the pencils are bright and attractive. I like the colors of the pencils, and they are very comfortable in the hand.
