I love these sheet protectors--I use them for all kinds of things. I use these sheet protectors for information I save about each book I write. I also use these sheet protectors for my volunteer work the Cardiac Rehab center. I also use the sheet protectors for my printed recipes. Since the sheet protectors are acid free they also are great for scrapbooks. I've always used clear sheet protectors -  I use them with music sheets when I play at Church and occasionally I have a problem with glare (though it's usually not so bad). I prefer matte finished sheet protectors. If you are looking for sheet protectors for a large project that would require hundreds of these, I would recommend the lightweight sheet protectors. The sheet protectors have a matte finish, which means that when you're reading under harsh lights, the pages don't have a lot of distracting sun glare or fluorescent light glare. These sheet protectors have kept me from getting those plans greasy or dirty while huddled in the back booth of a Waffle House. These are well- made sheet protectors, They look frosted but this is the non-glare ... something I appreciate ... it doesn't interfere with legibility at all. These non-glare sheet protectors are just the ticket for solving that issue!Now all my recipes are organized and protected from any kitchen mishaps.As for the non-glare aspect, the matte finish does really help. I guess it is too much to hope for that heavy weight non-glare sheet protectors will also be transparent. These heavyweight non-glare sheet protectors are very attractive (if you care about that) and easy to load. I've used other sheet protectors, but these are thicker and stand up to frequent handling much better. These sheet protectors are perfect for anyone using them under stage lights. I keep them organized in sheet protectors stored in a binder. These Wilson heavyweight sheet protectors are very well made. These sheet protectors are perfect for that: they're sturdy and roomy. They are clear matte sheet protectors, which work much better than the glossy ones in my opinion. These sheet protectors are thicker and more substantial feeling than ones I have previously used. And they are acid free, so the sheet protector is not likely to affect what is being stored, which means picking up stains and transferring them back onto the contents, smudging them. This is a great all-around sheet protector product from Wilson Jones. I am replacing my older beat-up sheet protectors with these protectors. Really like these sheet protectors! On a printed sheet that is a little wavy, it makes parts seem slightly unfocused and bothers my eyes. I got the non-glare because I use these to keep sheet music in 3-ring binders and the sun was giving me trouble. Now I print them once, drop them in the sheet protector, and file them in a binder, also using a Wilson Jones product, View Tab Extra Wide dividers. These are sturdy, easy to use sheet protectors. These Wilson Jones Heavy Weight sheet protectors are great.
