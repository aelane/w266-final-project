Good product and although a little cost prohibitive if you use a lot of them, it still might be worth it for your time. They are a high-quality product from a reliable manufacturer. This is a great product if you want to pay the added cost for convenience. I'm happy with this product and I'd definitely buy it again!! I use this product for online USPS Click-N-Ship postage printing. Certainly is a quality product. Right product to get the job done with less waste. This product is recommended for inkjet printers. Overall, a great product that is simple to use and does what it says, but just too expensive for what it is and does.
