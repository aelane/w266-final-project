The D rings are not stiff, so you can open the binder by pressing only one lever at the bottom. Unlike O rings, they don't slide over easily. The D-Lock rings are easy to open just one touch! You cannot pull the rings open by pulling on the rings.There is no clear plastic over the colored plastic, so you cannot insert pages on the front/back/end strip. The rings open and close crisply. You can't really open it easily by pulling the rings apart, which means that your papers won't just fall out. You can easily open the rings with one hand. All this is good for a binder.The rings are round at the back but flat on the front side that comes in contact with paper. The rings are about average and look sturdy enough.

The rings line up easily when you click it shut.

I'm left handed and the big rings bother me when I'm writing.

The rings don't look like they're going to wear out anytime soon.
