You're more likely to lose it (or have it "borrowed") before the generous ink supply runs out.With or without decoration, this is the best disposable pen I've ever used...period. You almost expect neon ink to come out of them, I also anticipate the design will eventually scratch off. She noted that the ink dried quickly and went on smoothly. He also noted the smooth ink delivery and quick drying when used on newsprint.I'm the general-use gal. What I love even more is I don't have to throw them out when I run out of ink, as these too are refillable with a G2 pen refill. They all have black ink and have clips so you can put them in your pocket if you want to. "It was when he said, "The ink's the Permanent kind, you know," that I realized that he had me at a severe disadvantage. I love the super black ink, smooth writing fine point and the comfy soft grip. It is a big plus that they are refillable so I don't need to throw the pen away when I run out of ink. I only wish the ink was waterproof so I could use them for everything. The ink also didn't flow as smoothly as I am used to and even slowed my writing down a bit. Only black ink. I find the ink often skipping across the page. The ink flow is effortless. The ink runs smoothly and the lines are well defined. And, even though the ink color of these pens doesn't stray from the basic black, these pens WILL look great on a work desk, and the fact that they're refillable is an added bonus.Good for adding a little shimmer to the average, everyday "blah" workstation, smooth-writing and comfortable in the hand - especially with the rubber grips they're sporting, these pens have plenty of ink to hold you for quite some time. The ink is so smooth and doesn't smear and it is there from first contact of the pen to paper, no drawing little circles to get the ink flowing. When originally purchased, I thought the ink matched the color on the barrel.I love the way the ink flows. The ink is black. The ink does not flow quite as smoothly on notebook paper as I had hoped. Originally, I thought the ink was different colors, but it is the design that is different. The ink gel dries almost immediately, minimizing chances of smears. Although pricier than standard ink pens, these will last longer and are of higher quality, and thus worth the extra money.

The ink *will* smear if you get it wet (even if you wait for it to dry).

While the ink isn't waterproof, it is almost smudge proof.

The ink is not impressive, and the black ink looks like pencil writingAlso, the outside chamber that holds the ink, is cheap looking.
