The nicest thing about this dispenser is having clean Post-Its readily at hand without having to scrounge through a drawer. It is designed for one thing, and does it well. One thing I like about it is that the mounting is semi-permanent; meaning you CAN remove it if you want to and reapply it somewhere else. The only thing is, you have to buy the side pull post-it notes to use it properly, even though it will do fine in holding the regular ones. I don't want to rip this thing off the wall and replace it every time I run out. The only thing missing is a pen. Unfortunately the elastic snap-back thing did not work for me at all. 3M is always thing of nice new ways to use pop-up notes.

The only thing that would have been better is if it came with the pen shown in the packaging that I can buy to go with it.

It's nice to remove one more thing from my desk drawer.

The one thing you have to say is they certainly went through great detail to make sure you understand how to mount it.Using the darn thing was a different story, but once I figured out what the slit in the plastic container was for - things became clearer.So after spending 2 minutes of my life setting this thing up - I stuck it on the wall.
