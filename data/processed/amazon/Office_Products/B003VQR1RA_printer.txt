Good printer wish they would update the firmware to support AirPrint but I didn't buy it for that. I have had the printer hard freeze on me when it is on for a few weeks, unplug and it fires right back up. I use this printer to print my photographs. I wanted a printer that could also make copies and scan documents. I really like this Canon printer and it is perfect for a home setting where there is average use. While you can certainly find a printer with more features I think anyone looking for a decent multifunction that's going to last, this is a good choice. This is my third Canon printer and directly replaces a Canon MP470.Overall, I was very pleased with the MP470, but I have to say this printer has exceeded that one in all areas. I was amazed at how quickly this printer was printing after I had pressed the OK button. *Flexible - the printer will print from, and scan and save to, a variety of sources. And voila the printer was up and running. I used to have an HP printer and I just want to kick that thing out to the curb. This printer has been a great assist to me since my purchase, sometimes it doesn't work but I can always play around and fix it. I currently own an HP 6400 Series All-In-One printer. This printer is very affordable for what it does.First, it is easy to setup and install. The printer is very sleek and has a very modern look. From opening the printer box, it took me about an hour to set this printer up and have it working on my laptop AND my desktop. When my HP printer started to run low on ink the colors on the paper would come out bad. This printer is great. I'm worried because the printer is currently in storage, so the ink tanks might leak from disuse. The printer has it all, and is compact (paper feeds into the bottom tray, older printers used to have the tray sticking out, how times have changed! The printer is completely digital and very, very slow. This printer is awesome. This was initially just strange, given I kept the printer and my workspace very clean, and could be cured by sticking a USB stick in the port that it did recognize. Got this printer to replace my Brother(gave to my nephew in college-works fine after five years), to get better photo printout. I have been using this printer for almost 2 years now and I absolutely love this product.
