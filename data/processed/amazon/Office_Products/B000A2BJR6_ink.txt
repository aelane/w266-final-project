Black ink is black ink but it makes my photos look terrific. From now on, if the CLI-8 ink is offered in kits that allows me to buy the inks that I need for my kerosene-powered Pixma, I will buy them from Amazon! Nothing special about it, just ink, but it worked great for the intended purpose. I find the ink last a fairly long time (good number of full pages printed) and quality... well, I've tried the self refills and the generic brands and all the ones I tried were awful. This is the ink I need for it at a fair price. However, I've started using ink cartridges from LD Products, sold here on Amazon for $4.99, saving me over $80 when I replace all my inks. Will buy more ink when I need it... Canon CLI-8 4-Color Multipack Ink TanksHave been using this ink system for over a year and Amazon's prices are the lowest yet. What I mean by that is that the ink level seems to go down on its own even if you don't use the printer. I always buy these Cannon ink packs because I never have problems with them.The description is right on and the shipping is fast.I recommend this. This is Canon's own ink so obviously it is ideal for Canon multifunction devices. This ink prints black in a nice clear way. This ink was purchased for a Canon 9000 photo printer. All my ink tanks typically get used up at almost the same rate on the Canon IP4200 so I usually just order theCanon CLI-8 4-Color Multipack Ink Tankspackage, which consists of: Magenta CLI-8M (this ink tank),Cyan CLI-8C,Yellow CLI-8Y, andCLI-8Bk Black. You should ideally use only genuine Canon ink cartridges but if you're strapped for cash, you can purchase the cheaper generic versions (non-OEM) of the CLI-8 cartridges.-CLI-8 4-Pack-CLI-8 Magenta&lt;-- non-OEM equivalent of this cartridge (Canon CLI-8M)-CLI-8 Cyan- CLI-8 Yellow-CLI-8 BlackI have not verified that they do in fact work as claimed so try them at your own risk!Bottom Line-----------The Canon CLI-8C/M/Y/BK ink cartridges may be expensive, but they deliver consistently high quality text and photo prints. Well-priced if you only need one ink. I buy this ink for my Canon 9000 Mark II printer. I only use Canon ink in my printer and this ink is perfect. When I see what this ink (and printer) can do, it makes me hold back my anger at the cost of replacing the ink when necessary.My printer uses six ink colors (Black, Cyan, Yellow, Magenta, Photo Cyan, and Photo Magenta). If you buy original ink like this from the manufacturer, you aren't likely to get "cheap" costs, but you can reduce the costs a little from off list.So, again, other than the high cost, I rate these Canon inks as simply excellent. I buy all of my ink for my inkjet printers from Amazon. I use this ink for my Canon MP970 printer. Yes, generic ink costs less, but why take a chance on poor quality, poor pictures, or leaks?The yellow ink cartridge was well packed and shipped within a reasonable time frame. So, while this ink is great quality, let's just say that it annoys the ever-loving crud out of me that Canon (and everyone else) rips us off with these ink prices. I've always used genuine Canon ink. This is good ink, but a person has to shop a lot to find a reasonable price.
