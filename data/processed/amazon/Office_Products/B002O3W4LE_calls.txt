Cheap international calls, what's not to love? The good:  calls sound crystal clear, no issues with domestic calling. I've made a few calls which worked perfectly, no static, no dropping out, clear communications. The calls will be automatically forwarded to my cell. which includes Making 2 calls at once,Forwarding your voice-mail,Staying connected on the go,Blocking telemarketers,Choosing a virtual number,Identifying callers,Screening your calls,911 notifications,Using Ooma on your smart phone,Turning off the ringer plus your basic features Making and receiving calls,Call waiting,Blocking caller ID,911 calling,International and other calling services,Voice-mail,Playing massages at home,Checking voice-mail remotely,Changing voice-mail settings.PROS:Super easy to hook up(only 3 items)Setup time 15-30 minCalls are Crystal clear 98% of the timeSave your money $3.95-4.95(monthly)depending on where you liveLights on Ooma are adjustable (low,med,hi & Off)Duo setup optionsConnecting fax & other devicesWorks w/telephone you have nowPays for it's self after 4-6 months depending on what you pay1 year + and no problems working just fineYou can keep old email accounts(may have to re register)Only 1-3 small telephone problems in last year 1 big problem(technician fault)routine maintenanceYou can keep you old phone number($30-40) onetime chargeCons:$10 charge to(credit card)for international calls so you can make callsSmall 1-2 second delay before person you are calling can hear you(so you may talk over yourself's)Price I payed $180 6 months later price came down as low as $120(new)You may! For me though, if I need to make that one or two calls a year, I will have a lot of that $10 left sitting in my pre-paid account, though it will never expire.The quality is quite good. On some outgoing calls, I get a "busy signal" on the first attempt, when the person I was calling was not on the phone. Works well, calls are clear.

So I obviously recommend the Ooma Telo.3/30/10 UPDATE:  588 incoming/outgoing calls, total of 2830 minutes (47 hours) and everything is still great.

Not able to forward calls to cell phone even during network outage.

But, I still prefer Skype for calls from my computer.
