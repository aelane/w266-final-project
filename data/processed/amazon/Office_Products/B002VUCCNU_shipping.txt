I do highly recommend the Avery shipping labels whichever one you choose.Why only 4 stars? These shipping labels are fantastic! This shipping labels are a great way to keep track of your shipping in your own terms, because they incluide a paper receipt to be signed by the carrier/shipper or courrier, therefore giving you and your business writen proof of reception of the articles shipped.I've started using them for everything because they leave a track to follow. They are to be used for online shipping with the label on top and a receipt on the bottom. Overall, these are very well designed shipping labels that work well with more sophisticated shipping needs. So apparently the shipping services have a standard for how they align their labels (there is one exception on the instructions for UPS labels that are printed through eBay/PayPal where you have to set the top and bottom margins in the printer settings but hopefully soon eBay will fix that). That's what you want in a shipping label, something that sticks very strong. These Avery shipping labels are designed for ink jet printers and I have 4 of those connected to my home based business. Out comes a beautiful and professional shipping label that peels off and adheres straight to the package. Usually I handwrite my shipping labels, however I decided to give these new shipping labels from Avery a try.These label work flawlessly with the integrated print shipping labels options in eBay and Amazon.com.I have always found Avery to produce the highest quality labels. Before these I printed the shipping labels on paper and taped to affix them to the box/envelope. It works on all of the shipping label websites that I use. These are great adhesive shipping labels that worked like a charm with my HP inkjet printer and my netbook. Though I still take out as much as I can of the old shipping labels, I don't have to do so as much since the TrueBlock technology really does work in blocking out the old label when applying the new one on top.Also, I don't really use receipts as much since I print packing slips and keep track of the finances online, but I'm sure they would come in handy for someone opting for this Avery set.UPDATE 2/23/10: After using these for a while, I find that the adhesive isn't as strong as I'd like. Finally, some Avery shipping labels for eBay that have a label portion and a receipt portion. These shipping labels work well for online mailing label printing from USPS, Paypal, FedEX and UPS. The shipping labels you can print using their website are designed to be printed on standard paper, folded in half, and slipped into clear, adhesive envelopes. I use the USPS shipping assistant program when I print out shipping labels.
