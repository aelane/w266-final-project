I've only just used up the temporary toner cartridge that came with my Brother laser printer and installed the new one today. I go through about a toner a month but I print on average 2k pages with about a quarter of them front/back. Now, we have only to see how long the toner lasts. It was the official Brother toner as stated in the ad. I purchased a generic toner before and I has issues with it. I would stick with the OEM toner if you want quality printing. This is the standard toner cartridge for our Brother Laser Printer and it has served us well throughout the years. I use the "toner save" function for 95% of my printing (and can't really see any difference in quality). This toner cartridge lasted pretty long. They are horrible from a &#34;how much toner you get&#34; perspective. I use this toner all the time for my office and have no complaints. I bought this toner for my Brother printer, copy and fax machine. However, if it's coming direct from Amazon, I can assure you it's a genuine Brother toner cartridge, new and never opened. This toner I have been using it for more than a year now and do not have any problem. I'm reviewing the toner quality not the price of the toner so I am giving it 5 stars. The generic toner is 1/4 of the price and it works well for me. I recently bought this toner cartridge to replace the &#8220;starter&#8221; cartridge which came with my new 2270DW printer. Brother separates the toner cartridge from the image drum, so the replacement cost is relatively low. That deposited too much toner and produced print that was thick and raised, as if the print were embossed, and it caused me to wonder about how quickly the &#34;compatible&#34; toner would be used up, and what it was doing to the printer.
