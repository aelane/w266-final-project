I haven't used this sharpener for long (since the beginning of December), but it works wonderfully! The X-acto sharpener makes a nice, neat point that's easy to write with. This is a fine sharpener for occaisonal office or home use. So far, this sharpener seems solid enough by comparison. The sharpener makes a horrible grinding noise every time I sharpen a pencil. The X-Acto sharpener seems to be working well; it is just relatively noisy compared with my current Hunt Boston, and a former electric sharpener that the Hunt Boston replaced. This sharpener is good, not great, but probably right for the price. I think this because the sharpener i have and the picture Amazon has is different; as mine is all black. If you're looking for a cheap sharpener that can get the job done, i would recommend this. This sharpener even works well on the cheap decorated pencils that often shred in other sharpeners. The last sharpener we had ran on batteries and I felt like we were constantly changing them. A great sharpener that is more than able to keep up with our needs and won't run out of batteries. This sharpener is powerful and smooth, creating a very sharp, well-centered point.

This sharpener is extremely fast and delivers a very, very sharp point.

The Hunt Boston sharpener is relatively quiet and efficient.

Into the sharpener went a pencil.
