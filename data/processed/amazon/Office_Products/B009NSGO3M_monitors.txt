The monitors attached it, as I should have foreseen, don't.-- If you have a little duct tape left you can remove the monitors and attach a candle to each arm and use the product under review as a candelabra. I do wish that it was easier for me to get two monitors into a position that I like without having the monitors protrude so far away from the wall. While I won't be able to fully test this with TWO monitors until I move into my new office early next year, I can testify that the arms are fully strong enough to support a solid 24" monitor.I wish it were a little more adjustable though; right now it is basically either totally tight or else too loose to hold at all. And so I had to buy two new monitors to serve the purpose (and also to free up desk space).The MA260MB is very sturdy and clamped well to the back side of my PC desk. With both monitors firmly attached they can be maneuvered smoothly and easily into just about any position. While it is designed to hold two monitors it can be used for one monitor with no balance issues at all. Dual monitors is a must for any serious photo editing. I can't talk about some monitors being too light as I don't have light monitors to try it out on. He could never quite get the two monitors to align as he wanted.With this dual-monitor arm, he has arranged the monitors exactly as he likes. However, both of my monitors had the correct holes for the mounts. I can even move the monitors up and down and close together in front of the window to block the sun when it's at that low angle at the beginning of the day.It does seem sort of crazy that this dual monitor arm costs more than either of the small TVs it holds. When you're not using the monitors, the articulated arms allow you to easily move your monitors out of the way to free up desk space.Articulation:The Ergotron has several points of articulation for moving your monitor every which way: vertical tilt (it can actually be tilted so the monitor lays totally flat on its back), horizontal tilt, up, down, backwards, forwards, left, right,... you get the idea. Positioning of the monitors is still somewhat limited because the arms can't spin outward. And it's seriously really nice to get your monitors off the desktop. Also, because MacIntosh is MacIntosh, our monitors did not have the appropriate bolt hole patterns on the back for attaching the arms to the monitors and had to buy adaptors. I've got my three Dell Ultrasharp 24" monitors set up with theErgotron MX Mounting Arms, but I wanted to see what the 3M product was like. I really dig having my monitors on this, and will always going forward use a set up like this for managing my screens.

With lightweight monitors, you will NOT be able to move it up and down that easy.

I'm using this with two Dell U2412 24" Ultrasharp monitors and they work perfectly.There are two separate mounting options included.

****ATTACHMENTSAttaching monitors to the two arms that attach to the mast that attaches to the base involves a rather complicated series of steps involving the following:-- 6 ounces of construction adhesive or 1 ounce of superglue (supplied)-- 72 - 144 inches of duct tape, depending (supplied)-- an oxyacetylene welding torch or equivalent (NOT supplied)-- two 10-inch and four 24-inch bungee cords (supplied)It's the bungee cords that I object to, and for which I subtract one star from five.
