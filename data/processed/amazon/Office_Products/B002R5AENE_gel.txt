I've had some gel pens where the ink flow has been problematic--either not flowing enough or starting and stooping or coming out in globs and blotches. I generally like gel pens, but these left me a bit cold. The gel tip is just the right size for general writing needs, does not get "gloppy," does not break up or "stutter," and writes well with little effort. Bright colorful gel pens. As with all gel pens they are shipped with a bit of plastic on the tip that needs to be removed before first use. I have used gel pens for some years now so quite used to them. The gel pens flow very well, with little pressure needed to make them work and I like the medium (0.7 mm) point; not too thick, not too thin, it's just right. All eight of these Papermate gel colorsPaper Mate Medium Point Retractable Gel Pens, 8 Colored Ink Pens (1746323)simply flow and flow across the page making writing and sketching fun. These gel pens were impossible to use until I received a reply from another kind soul who told me to pull a blue plastic nub off the point of each pen. Retractable gel pens, with a sharp fine point, that float nicely over paper - no skipping or scratching. These gel pens are perfect in every respect. I thought I would mostly appreciate having a retractable gel pen - no loose caps to keep track of. I know I've used gel pens in the past that were to say the least, unreliable. These Paper Mate retractable gel pens write smoothly, and are extremely comfortable to hold. These are very nice gel pens. I generally only use gel pens that have a metallic sheen or glitter, so these leave me wanting more.The gel flows very smoothly, just as promised on the package. I don't normally use gel pens. So this is the first gel pens I have tried.I was very pleasantly surprised to see the array of colors - orange, purple, green and pink as well as the blue (2 pens), black and red. I have used all 8 of these colored gel pens (medium 0.7mm tip) retractable - they work very well on paper, with good flow, nice colors (none bright except pink & green), and dried fast for me...I'm not a fan of ball-point pens, and I adore extra fine & even sometimes fine point pens, but I actually liked these medium ones. Indeed, Paper Mate is comparable to other 07 gel pens, such as thePilot G2 Fine Point Rolling Ball Blue Gel Ink Pens, 2-Pack (31032)andUniball Medium Point Gel Pens 0.7MM, Black Ink, 3 Pens/Pack (Pack of 2). As gel pens, the colors are vivid and bright on white paper (the pink is a little paler than the others) and they write so smoothly that I actually ran my finger over the line expecting it to come away wet. These Paper Mate Gel Pens are among some of the best gel pens I've ever tried.
