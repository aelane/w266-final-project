I like this for keeping mail off the tables.The magnet is stronger than expected and I'm confident that it will never have any issues holding anything I'd want to put in. Better than having mail all over the kitchen.One big problem I had was that the sticker on the front left some residue that I haven't been able to get off. It is a simple mail organizer with a magnetic back.It is currently attached to our fridge. This mail holder is very useful and very durable. I am using this mail holder flap for door (which is metal) The entire back of this flap has a thin magnet sheet on it so it really holds in place strong.It is great to keep my mail in the flap so when I am on my way out the door I can take it with me. Not really a pouch, but more of a U shaped plastic mail holder. I suppose it's better than leaving open mail lying around on a countertop, but as the basis of an organizational system for your mail, it's pretty useless. This mail organizer is a good solution. Our mail is always scattered on top of the counter and it's such a mess, so I thought I would get this to tidy things up.It works as it should.Right now, it's attached to the fridge and is pretty secure. It's great not only for organizing mail but also for containing any loose pieces of paper that need a home, such as recipes, instructions, care and use manuals, etc. I bought this not so much for mail or business use, but for my refrigerator. This mail organizer pouch is solid - the entire organizer is magnetic, so you actually have to pull the pouch off the fridge if you want to move it, an organizer that will not easily be bumped or come loose and send papers flying all over the kitchen floor. This mail organizer holds a lot of mail and the magnets are strong. I always have mail lying around, so I needed this.

If you are not careful, the mail or coupons fall out the sides of the organizer.

This mail organizer is pretty neat but it has some drawbacks.

I had an awesome mail pouch that we collected receipts in.
