I have always bought and used ordinary staplers with hit-or-miss effectiveness. I am very picky about my staplers and I hate this one. With most desktop staplers, the plate rotates to reveal a different plate that causes the edges of the staple itself to spread outward instead of inward. I will still keep my other staplers on hand for tacking and other purposes, but for standard desktop use, the PaperPro Evo Desktop stapler is difficult to beat and it has quickly become our household stapler of choice due to its power and convenience. I usually like heavy staplers but honestly this one works better. The new EVO LX is one of the best, lightweight staplers to date.At first glance and feel, it appears to be a bit on the "chincy" side, but it's lightness is one of its greatest advantages.Easy loading, super easy to use.Highly recommended! We have several staplers around the house. We've owned quite a few staplers and had a love hate relationship with many of them. I usually buy metal staplers because I like the heft but I am going to give this a try.

I prefer the muted "crunch" of more sturdy staplers.

Some staplers enable you to rotate the plate so it can splay the ends of the staples open.I tested two kinds of staples.I first tested a strip of Swingline S.F.

It is easier to staple with it than with other similar-sized staplers that I possess, but it is harder to fill and empty.
