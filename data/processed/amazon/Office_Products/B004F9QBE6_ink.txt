Too often, it seems the ink doesn't flow well, so you get skips in your writing. I wonder why blue ink is not so popular today. The ink comes out easily you don't have to press down hard to write. The ink isn't exactly jet-black, but it's perfectly adequate. The ink flows well from the pen tip. For under $6.00 you get 16 regular black ink pens ... The ink is black and writes like a standard ballpoint pen. The ink lines are solid and bold. One of these I can leave until the ink runs dry. You can clearly see how much ink is left in the pen, always a good thing to know.So many different things are made for either men or women, so why not pens? Black ink. Not the ink--the ink is black, regardless of the pen's body color. The ink flowed nicely as I wrote - so big bonus there. However, especially with black ink only, these pens didn't really dazzle me either. Even though the ink is neither purple nor scented like tropical fruit, and there are no cute decorations such as pompoms, feathers, or sequins, the plastic pen comes in an assortment of translucent pastel colors.
