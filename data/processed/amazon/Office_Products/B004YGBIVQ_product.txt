I was intrigued by this product using two adhesive strips, to keep the stack flat until used. This product is three pads of Sticky Notes. Great product! I was hoping for a better product than what this turned out to be: the paper is not as sticky as it should be, and it tends to curl -even with the extra strip of adhesive. This product works better than standard sticky notes when you stick it to a tube of some sort.+ NO CURLING -this only works if you pull it off from the SIDE, instead of the top or the bottom. I will give this product three stars if you use it for curved surfaces and peel it without curling... but two stars, otherwise. It's a good product. I'm pleased with this product. Just overall, a much better product than the original 3m. I was expecting a product that would stick flat and provide a little more "glue" for those projects that need a little extra "stick" to execute it properly. As it is though, I can't really recommend this product to anyone. All and all, a fine product for all all your self adhesive posting needs. I don't know if I received the wrong product, or if my expectations were wrong. Great product! Overall, I was very happy with this product and think it is a marked improvement from single-adhesive-strip sticky notes. Avery's product picture even shows an example where you can use these notes on cylinders which could be handy to some people.I've tested these notes over 2-3 days on a flat surface, and everyone of them that I've applied normally regardless of color is curling upwards due to the stick not holding firmly. Great product and highly recommended. I love this Avery product & recommend it.
