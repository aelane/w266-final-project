I ordered these labels intending to use them with my printer. Great simple labels. These labels to use on packages are just what I need.There is adequate s[ace for the address and I like  the extra section for the return address. The labels peel off easily and stick tight. These labels are thin, and the writing from the previous label SHOWED THROUGH!!! I'm not loving these labels! I always need shipping labels for my small business (I ship out knitting patterns) and have had great luck with avery and their word templates. How much can you really say about shipping labels? When I first saw the Avery 45280 labels I thought, "What is the use for those?" The labels are 2-5/8" x 3-3/4" so they are a perfect size for most uses. The only negative is that these labels will not work in a printer. These are write-on labels, and not designed for printers and therefore not suitable for mass mailings, but when you just need to get a birthday present out or have an occasional product that you ship, these fit the bill nicely.These labels have an easy-write matte finish which is a nice texture to the touch as well, and supply ample room for the average hand-written address, without an excessive size that would make it hard to fit them your average box.The From and To are labeled and separated by a line.The adhesive is strong, so it will stay on without any doubt.It's perfect for what it's designed for. Once those labels ran out I couldn't get the company to make more, so began my journey to find some we could print ourselves. We also needed labels that could be typed quickly by some of our employees that still use typewriters, the Dymo label surface is a slick smooth surface that does not respond well to ink. These labels not only have the surface we needed to use typewriters but they also load in our deskjet printers for color or black printing. These are really great labels. They are individual labels in a pad, not a sheet. Having the labels in the form of label pad as opposed to the more conventional larger label sheets is also very practical, especially for storage. There are 40 shipping labels that make up a small pad. The labels are very attractive and easy to write on and easy to attach. These shipping labels come on a pad and are the perfect size for mailing a variety of packages and letters. I use these labels to cover labels that don't completely pull off, when returning a package. These labels come in a pad form about 3" x 4", so you can peel them off one at a time, which is handy. I am very pleased with these labels. The labels are small enough to keep in a desk drawer, but large enough to write on and, for the delivery person to read the label. I like the labels because they come in pad form of 40 labels that are bonded together at the top so you can easily tear off a label or two like a memopad. These labels are significantly smaller than USPS priority labels you can get *free* at the post office (over 1" smaller in each direction). These white labels are easily overlooked on a white box - and are not obvious if placed anywhere but the top of the box...The To: and From: fields are clearly imprinted.... so they are only usable as address labels and may be ideal to affix on the INSIDE of a box you're shipping via FedEx or UPS.Sorry, I just can't rate them higher than "OK" because the free labels at the post office have a superior design and acceptable quality. Avery To/From Shipping Label Pad, 40 Labels (45280)I don't know what else to say about these fine labels. Nice labels. These labels come in a pad form, so you don't have a bunch of loose labels floating around in your desk drawer. These labels will solve that problem because if I need to, I can just write out another label. These are nice labels as they fit on a business envelope or greeting card, yet are big enough for an 8 by 10 envelope. So I thought these self-adhesive labels would be a great alternative. They were great!Like most Avery labels, this is a quality product. The labels are easy to find in your desk in a neat little pad. Since the labels are in a pad, you can address them on your desk or on the box - you just can't put them through a printer - but I'm sure Avery makes another product for that.This is definitely something I'm glad to have tucked into my desk. These are very useful labels for anyone who would be sending out occasional packages, or for those who don't use printer labels for mass or regular mailing.Plenty of pros:** I love that labels are on a pad and not separate--easy to throw into a drawer, and easy to just place the pack on a desk to start writing labels. ** The labels are the right size to completely cover most UPC labels on a package. But for labels, they're very handy, serve their purpose perfectly, and and are a great way to keep your  desk a little bit neater. The labels peel easy and have clean edges. These labels are held together much like a tablet is. This makes these labels ideal for sitting on desk. This is great to store these labels in between uses. Having the labels in a pad format is nice because the single labels won't get scattered or lost, but labels are not really the sort of things I would carry around in the first place, so the point was somewhat lost on me. These labels are very easy to use when you are in a hurry and don't need to use your printer. I've used Avery labels for years and always happy with the quality. I can just leave these labels at the shipping area and they work well.They do seem to be a little more expensive that buying sheets of labels by the box, but there isn't as much waste for our office.I don't want to knock off stars for this, but I prefer labels without the from and to so I can use them for other things than just shipping. Well, what can you say....these are shipping labels. So, I guess feeling guilty that I was 'stealing', when I saw these shipping labels on Amazon, I scapped them up in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, I find these labels too small for my taste. They are awesome!If you are wanting labels to write on and don't want to use a printer, these are for you. Great labels for mailing and labeling. OK, you might ask what can be said about mailing labels?Well, the two key features I would want are right here:  the label is big enough to fit many lines on the address, AND these permanent labels STICK!I would add that the labels are designed so that they look very nice as well.a good product that I will buy again These mailing labels stand out, however, because they are held together on their top edge like Post It notes or like a grocery list notepad designed to tear off one sheet at a time. Avery does labels right. The labels are large with plenty of space for both the recipient and return addresses.These labels are not appropriate for consistent business use being far too expensive for everyday shipping and write-on rather than printer labels, but for home use (when you'll only need one or a few at a time) they're perfect.I'm pleased, and I will purchase more when these are gone.UPDATE: August 25, 2009Perhaps I should have waited until the packages I labeled with these labels arrived. Did the labels fall off? The Avery To/From (45280) labels are perfect for sending interoffice packages. This keeps the labels from being strewn about while still be able to fit in a small desk drawer. these handy labels are great for addressing packages by hand. I got these labels to cover existing labels and reuse packaging envelopes. I wouldn't use these labels on a package. I do not reccommend these labels. The labels also seem to be very firmly attached, one you smooth them in place. I've tried these labels for both handwriting (which it's designed for), and also for inkjet printing (which was a nice extra that worked).The labels are easy to peel, comes of nicely from the back pad. I was able to remove the labels both from paper envelopes and from card boxes with little effort, and non-destructively. Other than that, they're pretty much what they say address labels meant for pen and pencil use, not computer shipping. These labels are great and the perfect size for most any package. These are nice, sturdy, convenient labels. The Avery To/From Shipping Label Pad (45280) are very nice labels. I like that the labels because, hence the name, are in pad form meaning, all 40 labels are glued together at the top so you can easily tear off a label much like that of a note or memopad. This is good so that the labels aren't loose and there is less chance for any to be lost plus if you decide to throw away the packaging, you can have the labels on your desk whenever you need them. I had to hold my old labels together with a rubber band to keep them together. These are good basic labels. The labels stick great to all the surfaces I tried them on, paper, bubble mailer, cardboard. The labels stick down great and if you try to remove them you will rip the surface of what you had it stuck down to. It's nice that the labels are on a "spine" so that they are easily removed from the pad.

The labels have a matte surface and work with any kind of pen.Avery has been the major industry leader in labels since it pioneered the product starting in 1935, when R. Stanton Avery made the first self-adhesive label in a Los Angeles loft.
