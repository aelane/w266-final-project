This riser is okay, if you only paid about half of the current price. The riser on it's own was the perfect height for my desk and chair.Use: For me it has been very helpful. Basically, all this riser features are some detachable rubber feet to make the riser higher, and the instructions are not necessary to understand how they work. It arrived quickly and I eagerly unpacked it only to encounter a big, mostly plastic, highly unappealing riser. I presently use a 3.75" riser and the Fellowes without feet is about 3.8" or for my purpose:  identical. This is a nice riser for the modern day. This helps in dragging the riser as you want while setting it up and also on adhoc purposes. The riser itself will not reduce the strain on your neck and shoulders. It's hard to say all that much about this riser.

I'm using the riser for my AOC flat widescreen monitor and it fits just right, with room to spare.

My new Fellows riser works perfect for me and its much better looking than the cardboard box I was using.

But at least for me, this riser didn't offer enough advantages to cause me to stick with it.Disclosure:Obtained From: Amazon Vine Review ProgramPayment: Free
