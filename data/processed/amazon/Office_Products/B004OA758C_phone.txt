I like this phone because it is portable and you can take it all over my apt. got what I paid for...its a phone...it works..... We needed an expensive phone for our land-line. I wanted a cheap, cordless phone and this definitely qualified, price-wise. The phone was charged and operating within a few hours and serves its purpose. looking for a cheap phone, this was the one i found. That said, this phone works well, looks good on the desk, and has the features we wanted. This is a great phone to keep by your bedside.
