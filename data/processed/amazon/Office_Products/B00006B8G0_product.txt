They're an Avery product, so the templates for using these labels are built into almost every application you're likely to use with them, so formatting the print data is a snap. I'll feel confident in ordering this product again. Not much to say here, the product works as advertised. Nice product that I will buy again in the future. This is a useful and reliable product. In this yet another superior product from Avery, these laser shipping labels can be accommodated to any size envelope as they are not too big and not too small, so as to  seem not aesthetically fitting.Their actual size is 2" x 4", guaranteed to be jam free and smudge free (haven't tested this claim extensively yet as I have just begun to use them. I like any product that helps me to recycle. But you are definitely getting a better product for the money. If you want a product that wont peel off when you don't want it to (like in your printer or at the post office) one that gives crisp imaging and conforms to the templates you have with your label program or word processing software, and one that presents well to the recipient, then stick to Avery and you won't be sorry. Been using their product for years and I think these are a good improvement over prior functionality.I did use the template and verified that the printing surfaces were clean and ready to go prior to use. This is a quality product.
