My last electric sharpener would drive me crazy because it would sharpen pencils to a point, but half the tip would be covered in wood. She wasn't too enthused, it is a sharpener after all, but she loved it, too.I have faith that this sharpener will make it through the upcoming school year, once it starts. I got this sharpener for my 5 year old son so he could sharpen pencils by himself. The sharpener has a large footprint and is relatively heavy which makes it very stable. This sharpener is wonderful! This sharpener has two steel shafts that are covered with spiral cutting edges which come to a point. With this sharpener, when the pencil has been sharpened the sharpener shuts off completely. It's a quiet sharpener that will stop sharpening as soon as the pencil reaches a point. but still is a great sharpener. The sharpener stops when the pencil is perfectly sharpened, it is quiet, and easy to operate. This sharpener is considered a heavy use unit; I agree. 2's are more often used it is an exceptional sharpener andits durability, quietness and quickness are more likely appreciated. This is one nice sharpener, it even sharpened color pencils to a nice point. I primarily use this sharpener for my colored pencils, which are Prismacolor (a slightly softer colored pencil). I've never really found ANY electric sharpener that states that it is made for colored pencils, and this one is no exception -- but I've had good luck with it. The sharpener is fairly quiet when using it. My cheapo two-buck manual sharpener is vastly better than this overpriced ineffective one.The few pros--it allows for multiple sizes and the shavings reservoir is quite large. It's a very fast sharpener, pretty noiseless for an electric one. The sharpener had worked perfectly.This is an excellent pencil sharpener, and is quickly becoming my favorite. Love this sharpener. Additionally, the sharpener is relatively quiet so it doesn't disturb others when used. This sharpener is not for CRAYONS!! The sharpener will not stop rotating but the blades will disengage.

This sharpener produces ultra-thin lines of shavings that fall neatly to the bottom of the reservoir and take up very little space.

I was very excited about how solidly made this sharpener seemed; it looked like something that would last a long time.

This sharpener performed excellently!
