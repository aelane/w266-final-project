I would say these are more designs that a woman or girl would like more than a guy.These are very sturdy as well. These have really cute designs on them and are prefect for someone that wants to add their own personal style. The designs are contemporary. The designs are gorgeous. The designs are nostalgic and remind me of muted, psychedelic pop art that is jazzy.The dividers can be used as scrapbooking paper. Beautiful designs can be created. The designs are &#34;modern retro&#34; and each is different from the other yet the whole is very harmonious. The designs are really nice and stunning in one of my favorites... pink and brown. I really liked the assorted designs of these tab dividers.

Overall I love the designs, colors & thickness, but because I keep my pedigrees in sheet protectors I cannot see the tabs when they are in the binder as they are not big enough (pictures have been posted in the customer photos).

The designs should appeal to young and old alike and a nice change from the plain and the dull.

The five designs are different, but they go together very nicely.
