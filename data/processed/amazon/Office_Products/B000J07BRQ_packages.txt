That means, I can wrap packages and know this tape will hold!What is important is how the tape stays on the roll! Works well, even on heavier packages. I use it not only for sealing packages, but for protecting address labels as well. It seals packages well and holds up. It is great for mailing packages. It's thin, flimsy, and for light packages it is fine.On the other hand, there are times when I have shipped items that were heavy and worried that the package would explode because the tape wasn't heavy enough. I have not had any of my packages rip open or tear because of this tape.The plastic dispenser is so easy to use and they are small enough to store in the kitchen junk draw without taking up a lot of room.Great Strong Tape, made in the USA. I send packages frequently and I like the value of buying 6 rolls at a time and the packaging of the rolls makes it easy to store. Works great for returning those packages to Amazon! The packages are not big enough to justify one of those larger pistol grip industrial dispensers and so the smaller Scotch tape dispensers work perfectly.

It's perfect for wrapping those packages for USPS or UPS - and the tape is clear and strong.I hope the person who invented this is living a gooooood life!

Mostly for mailing packages but I've also used it when moving boxes needed to be sealed.

I want to make sure the packages are secure, tight, and presentable.
