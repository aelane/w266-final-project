I would take random notes of phone calls, items I purchased, project notes, news articles and file them in my yearly &#34;infobase&#34;, possibly never to be looked at again. I can type far more neatly and quickly than I can handwrite notes, then scan them into Evernote.So, these are great Post-it note pads in several lovely colors. After scanning a few notes into Evernote, they don't really give me any true advantage over simply inputting directly into Evernote. I wasn't really sure how these could be so much better than regular sticky notes that they merited their own name, but I do think these are a bit more sticky or &#34;super sticky.&#34; I have never had one fall off the wall on me or any other vertical surface.On the other end of the spectrum, I've also not had trouble removing one from delicate book pages. I tried sticking one of the notes to my refrigerator and to the wall and they did not fall off. Fabulous sticky notes! Not to big like some of the other sticky notes I have. Most of my regular Post-it notes lose some of their ability to stick if you move them several times or stick them to the edge of our computer monitor, so the thought of super sticky sounded great. Nor do I understand what makes these Post-it notes better than the other Post-it notes in what looks to me like the same colors for taking their picture and filing the post-it note electronically. Excellent Post-It notes. I did not notice them being more &#34;stickier&#34; than older Post-It notes. They are just the old fashioned trusted sticky notes that you can use for all purposes. As Post-it notes go, these are great. The best sticky notes are Post-its. I love that these post-it notes coordinate with my online Evernote notebook. Post-It notes have been great products since the day they hit the market. Boy do I like these sticky notes. These notes are then available across all your devices and are searchable. So I can only review these as Post-it notes... and in that regard, they're great. I use Post-It notes as mini to-do lists and reminders in my calendar/planner and after a few times of moving things around regular Post-It notes are prone to falling off and not sticking as well, but not so with the Super Sticky ones :) I love 'em and will happily look for them to purchase in the future. The notes are vivid colors -- if anything the blue is a little too dark. They are billed as &#34;Super Sticky Notes,&#34; and I wonder if this means that the notes are super sticky or the sticky notes are super.

I use sticky notes constantly to remind myself of important to-do lists, and as such, have tried out quite a few different brands over the years.

The sticky notes are not too sticky (to where they damage wood veneer surfaces &#8211; yes I had that happen before with some Avery Brand sticky notes) and not so weak as to constantly come unstuck (once again, a problem with some Avery brand sticky notes).

The Post-It notes are great.
