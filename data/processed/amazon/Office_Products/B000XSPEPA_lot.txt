If you have a lot of wrapping to do, this system comes in handy. If you use tape a lot, such as I do, this is a wonderful and convenient product. Especially if you use a lot of tape or office supplies. (Assuming you use a lot of short strips of tape!) If you have a lot of gift wrapping to do buy this! It works well, and it would definitely be worth using if you have a lot of packages to wrap (or just want to wrap very neatly or just get really frustrated from holding down paper with your nose, foot, chin, etc. (I assume you own a lot of cats if you own this. It's a lot easier to use for gift wrapping compared to normal tape dispensers. I was able to wrap a lot of more gifts in less time, even though the tape lengths weren't always perfect.. It took a lot of pressure to push the dispenser open, but then you just have to slide the tape cartridge inside. But if you are wrapping a lot of gifts, say for Xmas,and you don't have help, this saves time and frustration. A lot of the convenience it provides is the result of using pre-cut strips of tape, which are the perfect size for gift wrapping and pop up like Kleenex as you pull them out. I wrap a lot of presents at Christmas-time, and often find that I'm surrounded by boxes, unwrapped presents, wrapped presents, wrapping paper, pens, labels, ribbons & bows etc. I wrap a lot of gifts year-round, especially at Christmas time. But, if you do a lot of wrapping or similar stuff, I can see why having one of these around would be a time saver. A lot of the tape strips also stuck together and 5-10 of them came out all at once.
