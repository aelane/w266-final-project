These particular folders are of average weight and are quite adequate. We use manila folders all the time. So if you find yourself frequently searching and using manila folders this is the one to get. If you need Manila folders, can't go wrong with this. These folders are great quality -- extremely durable. Had planned on swapping out my old folders with these new, industrial strength ones, but...Honestly, the tabs are really not that much stronger than standard tagboard. While I do use file folders in filing cabinets I also use them extensively in an open type briefcase in my vehicle while traveling. The folders will do a fine job in any office and at home too. It keeps the folders standing up straight, for better visibility.But these folders....I've never seen such a mess. I will give away these folders, as they are unusable for my purposes.Even if they hadn't been defective, I was shocked by how flimsy the paper is. The folders themselves are laid out the same (with the indented tabs, 1/3 on the left 1/3 in the middle and 1/3 on the right) What is different is that these?They are a bit thicker than normal ones, but what is awesome is the reinforced tabs! These folders Definitely worth every penny! These folders have plenty of reinforcement there, to really do the job.The fold lines that allow the file to be neatly thickened at the fold are excellent. I like folders that last and last. The Smead folders fall into the good quality catagory. I was looking forward to getting these folders so I can tidy up our filing cabinet.I was pleasantly surprised at the weight and stiffness of these folders when I got them, because so many paper items feel recycled and flimsy these days. I would definitely look for these folders again based on the quality. But with 100 folders in the box, it will be a long time before we'll need more. It would be nice to find these folders with tabs in five places, instead of three, but for our home filing needs these will work perfectly.One small criticism is the thin, flimsy box they come packed in. If you use folders in your home of at the office, you can't go wrong with these. They do not match with the other folders I have and only time will tell if those square corners will show wear more than a rounded corner despite being double thickness. Believe me, flipping through folders is something I do several times a day, looking for a care plan or form that has to be filled out for patient records. Some other folders are hard to write on due to their waxy surface finish. These folders are pretty basic, but they definitely get the job done. However for what it's supposed to do, these folders are more than adequate. We love these folders and will definitely order more when it is time to re-stock. If you're crease intolerant these folders may get you endorphins flowing.
