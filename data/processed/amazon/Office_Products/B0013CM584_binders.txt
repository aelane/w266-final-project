Who knew binders could get me so excited!Edited: Just had to add after 3 months this thing STILL looks almost brand new. This one is going strong - it's like the Energizer of binders!! That is what I bought before I realized the even ring binders have levels of quality. I love binders, I use them for everything. So, as binders go, it is good product. D-ring binders are the best. I can stack other binders on top of it and not worry it's going to be crushed. So many binders have been made over the years that it is probably impossible to come up with a revolutionary improvement. In the past I've had binders that you need to flip open the flaps/locks from the top and the bottom, simultaneously. And the D-ring, I need to remember to always get D-ring binders from here on out, I love how it keeps the pages nice and straight and neat.Regarding the price, I've never been to a dollar store to see what kind of binders they may sell. These binders are of excellent quality, including the locking D-rings and pockets on the front and spine for inserting artwork or other identifying materials.

I love Wilson Jones binders!

These are some of the sturdiest, highest-quality binders I've ever purchased.
