This shredder is large, the weight is average, the container is a good size, and it has wheels which make it easy to move around. This AmazonBasics shredder is very good for the price. This shredder shreds 17 pages at one time as well as CD's, DVDs and credit cards. The shredder is enclosed in a large wastebasket which you remove by pulling the wastebasket out. Amazon Basics has come up with a very good shredder with this unit and it&#8217;s a good choice for the home or workplace.One of the greatest advantages with this shredder is its size. The shredder does not protect you completely, but it is one of the many ways to get started. This is my third shredder and I must say that this is an improvement over my old ones. I had a shredder from Staples and that thing was loud, but this AmazonBasics shredder is night and day quieter... much quieter; I'm really happy with that. This shredder just powered through envelopes and contents like it was nothing--that's the 17-sheet capacity I guess. Very impressive, and now the shredder I will use for all junk mail.Overall, I found this to be a very powerful, capable, cross-cut shredder for mild everyday use. I really like this shredder. This is a great shredder! This shredder works exactly like I need it to. This is a good shredder which will fulfill the needs of anyone wishing to shred a fairly light load of material. The shredder not only shreds in vertical strips about 1/8" wide, but also shreds those strips up into smaller pieces about 1.25" long. This is not the shredder for you if you are doing high volume shredding unless you want to spend a lot of time in front of it. It chops it up nicely though.Our old shredder would force through more paper and still run but the shredding on thick batches was not very good. That particular shredder never promised to shred more than 8 - 10 pages at a time, and unfortunately when pressed with something close to the upper limit it just couldn't - if you'll pardon the pun here - cut it, instead jamming up regularly. With this shredder you hold the items you are shredding straight up and down to get them started. Definitely much quieter than the Royal shredder that I had previously and other shredders that I've used. We like this shredder.

It's an efficient shredder, and comes close to the cross-hatching done by the most expensive shredders.

I have another shredder which produces little confetti pieces, but that one has always been a struggle to operate.

All in all, I love this shredder.
