So the tab has to be mounted on the REVERSE side of the page (I write on the page itself, so the tab can't be positioned on the current page). I put a tab at the beginning of each section with a written note on the tab to indicate what it was (Bio, Notes, whatever). As I read along I'd move the tab indicating the Notes section so I could speedily move to that section to read the note from the main text.It worked great. I left one tab in just to see if length of time in one spot made moving the tab without ripping the page difficult. If you use pen, you'd need to use that tab for only whatever you wrote on it or not mind discarding it.While they stick up a bit better than and the color makes them easy to see they can be used for file folders. You can write on the tab and adhere it to a book or report to which you need to refer later. To test these NoteTabs, I wrote on the tab with rollerball and ballpoint pens, and stuck them to regular computer paper, a regular book and a super thin Bible page.Writing on the tab, there was no problem. The entire tab is see through and is designed to mark sections or specific sheets of paper to turn to quicker and for very short notes. Write on the tab or highlight text beneath it and you'll be able to see through it; place it anywhere on your page, even reposition without causing rips or peels. When I pulled the tab off the page, it still left behind my pencil marks.My one complaint about these tabs is, I don't believe they are recyclable. The tab itself is as stiff as a business card and does not tear or fold over - yet can be easily removed without damaging the paper.The citrus colors are pleasing, and the contrasting colors allow you tabs to be coded or staggered to empahsize diffent categories of information to be found. It's more important to me to have a sturdy tab than a huge writing space.You can write on the transparent part of the tab as well, although what you write there will not be visible when the book is closed, obviously. They're not permanent either, so I can later remove the tab and it doesn't mar or damage the pages.I think these tabs would be a great addition to any type of work where one is frequently needing to check their books for the pertinent information. I like that they are lo-tac and when I misapplied a tab I was able to easily remove and reset it. Not to mention that you can write on the cleared tab portion. The clear sticky tab is great because if you have to cover part of your writing (or printed materials in a book), you can still read right through them. So if you place the tab down on top of pencil writing and then lift it up again it will get marks on it, and it's hard/impossible to erase them, because that part of the tab is sticky. So then if you readjust the tab or reuse it elsewhere, it will still have those visible stray marks on it.These are pretty minor points, but worth considering if you want to order a different shaped tab, or if you, like me, are a pencil note-taker. You can write both on the tab and the see-through surface area. on the tab itself for easy reference, then wrote who I wanted to make the pattern for on the clear part that sticks to the page. and you can write on the tab for any notes, etc. The circular tab is not only more attractive than highlights all over the pages, but they give you a small surface that you can write a note to yourself on, and if you need to mark more, the heavy duty clear sticky that goes over the pages is also write-on-able! They're much stronger than any other tab I've come across, meaning they should make it through the wear and tear of my man-bag and other toss and tumbles my books might go through.A+!
