Most other phones top out at 50.2. The phones are light, the display is clear, the keys are generously sized, and sound quality is excellent.2. When even cell phones can hold an almost unlimited number of entries, I can't imagine why so many other phones insist on a stingy 50-entry limit.Overall, the pluses mostly end up outweighing the minuses - hence my 4-star rating.Happy Calls! My old phones had gotten to where they wouldn't hold a charge well at all. These phones are great and reasonable priced, especially with the Bluetooth CELLLink feature. You receive two phones with this set:  1 has just charging base, the other has answering machine base (which I don't use since we have voicemail.) I've been using these phones for several months now, and I must say that I've been quite pleased. I have had five of these phones over the years -- usually three in service at any one time. These phones work great.

Now the phones are ready to use as well as to program following the menu in the users guide.Pretty much intuitive, but good instructions are in the manual.Programming the phone is not difficult.
