The Scotch Pop- Up Tape Handband Dispenser is a device designed to bring this problem to an end and it succeeds at its main task. This is a clever little device. Worked well for Christmas, but this device doesn't hold a lot of tape.Storage is a bit of an issue, too lightweight and unstable to leave out and the tape sticks out and collects dust in a drawer.I had one last year and the tape turned into one blob of plastic when stored with the wrapping paper in the attic.If you wrap all your gifts in one sitting or have a project that will need a lot of tape, then get one. This device helps in two ways, (1) by giving you a spare hand with which to control the tape, and (2) by using pre-cut tape that is not too long. This little device enables her to hold a tape despenser and still have two hands for the Kid's artwork. This little device makes wrapping a give a very simple operation. I don't know that I would purchase such a device if I didn't have a constant demand for tape. I have to admit, I thought this little device was a bit silly. This simple device has a clear purpose. For me, this device will go into a drawer and be kept for particular uses like those described above. This small device has been a pleasant surprise. I love this device. Having this device on your hand doesn't get it the way and you can do things, like wrap gifts, quickly.
