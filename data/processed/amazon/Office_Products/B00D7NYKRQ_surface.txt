If you need a larger writing surface, do go for a bigger size board. The surface is smooth so it's easy to write on, and wipes clean without any difficulty. )The surface of the board is very smooth, allowing you to write in (comparatively) small script. Likewise, the surface was easy to clean with just a dry paper towel. The writing surface is also pretty shiny at first. It is pretty lightweight, and the surface isn't standard chalk board, so we'll see how long it holds up. The writing surface small, cheap and the frame is over-sized and cheap. This appears to be a laminate surface with a &#34;grainy&#34; writing surface, and is NOT the smooth writing surface of a real chalkboard. It is handy and the surface is smooth and accepts the chalk well.

The surface of the blackboard is nice and smooth, and it allows for very easy writing with a chalk.

The surface is not grippy like a real chalkboard, but it serves its purpose of providing contrast against white writing.

the surface is nice and smooth and takes chalk well and wipes away clean.My wife and I have been using this to leave reminders/notes to each other and our kids ... and we've also started using it to help decorate during parties.
