I got both these labels, which are suitable for envelopes, and the larger shipping labels, which I use on boxes. These labels seem to be made very similarly, but I find the size less useful than the larger ones. Bad labels can also ruin an object (stain) to which it is attached.Avery is the gold standard in labels, and now they offer the repositionable labels. If you are clumsy like me you will love this labels just as much as I do. Great labels to happy mailing. I absolutely HATE using typical labels because when I try to peel them off and reposition them, they rip my envelope and I have to start all over again. I love Avery labels! The labels print flawlessly every time. Excellent, bright labels. Overall, these are fantastic labels. These labels are first of all, very white and the contrast needed for laser printers is something to consider. Otherwise the labels work well with MS Word and the downloadable Avery software. I would buy these labels again. These labels can be easily removed and reapplied without damaging the label or the envelope & they don't fall off after you do. However, with the "non-removable" labels, I'd be able to remove them without damage 25-50% of the time. I was concerned that labels might fall off during mailing since they were "removable." Additional, these labels did use Avery's easy apply technology using folds in the backing to achieve quick removalIf you send out lots of mailings and have to remove labels often, these labels will provide you some additional protection to reposition. I use these labels to label things in my kitchen. These labels give you a do-over. These labels seem fit for use in the typical office environment. These labels perform as advertised. When I print the labels, the text is sharp and readable with no bleeding. Also, when positioned, the labels stay put. I tried using these labels on envelopes and then left the envelopes on my desk for a few days, (the check definitely wasn't in the mail), and tried to see if the labels still came off. These labels are perfect for this. I also read out loud to classes quite often and these labels allow me to put questions in the book so I remember to stop and ask questions to help students relate the readings to their own experiences. These labels are really easy to move around and then be put back in their original position. You can easily reposition the labels if needed, but I have not noticed a problem with them coming off when you don't want them too. And at least you can be assured that they are "sometimes" re-positionable, which is more than other labels can offer. I must confess I love labels. These new REPOSITIONABLE labels solve a problem that has ruined many a nice project. These labels solve that problem by allowing me to remove then and restick them to the correct position. Even better, these labels feature Avery's Pop-up Edge allowing for easy removal of the labels from the backing, even the labels in the middle column. As with most labels the automatic software to make them fit the page is built into your Microsoft Word. Well, it just did because with these new repositionable labels I won't ever have to waste a label and do it again because I failed to position the label correctly. I can easily remove these labels without damage to either the envelope or the label! Standard, run-of-the-mill Avery labels -- that is to say, very useful tools when you have to send a bunch of Christmas cards, or thank you notes after a wedding or graduation. These labels also have that thing where you only have to bend the page a little for a bit of it to stick up so you can grab them. Good for Amateurs - I don't use labels all that often and when I do I'm not so good at positioning. These labels are great for temporarily labeling items. These labels work great if you're shipping a lot of enevelopes or product, and you are printing many out at once. We use our labels to attach to plastic dry cleaner bags as well as the regular envelope use and these do reposition once and then stick and stay stuck. The labels use the new Avery "easy peel" technology. I stuck five of the labels on a basic white number 10 business envelope, removed them all and then pressed them back down. We might not have to buy labels for a really, really long time. These labels are easy to use in my PhotoSmart HP printer, and since I have used them, I have had no jam issues. Another plus is that these labels are smudge-proof! I use these labels for mailing packages/letters, organizing my son's plastic bins and school folders, and for various other uses around the house. These labels perform exactly as described. Who doesn't love Avery labels and Amazon has the best price to be found. Avery labels are always of the highest quality and never disappoint. These are simply the best labels out there!Turn your home office into a printing center easily with these simple to use office labels that can be easily re-applied with their unique "re-hesive" capabilities.Use your home laser printer and quickly and easily turn out a professional looking mailing product.Make sure your mailed items do not get lost as this label very clearly states all information for quick sorting at the Post Office.With 3000 labels to the pack this is a great and economical printing solution. These repositionable labels are another fine addition to the line. Being since you can peel 'em off and move them, you waste far few labels. 3000 labels?! These labels do exactly what you want, don't jam, fall off, etc. These labels print great, and stick good. These labels do exactly what they say: you can reposition them even after you have applied them to paper or envelopes.Great idea if you mess up a lot centering them on envelopes.For most people this is not really necessary as the first time they put it on is okay. I tested these labels on an HP LaserJet Pro printer and used the labels for renaming file folders - our office prints out full-page postage/label sheets through Pitney Bowes, so I couldn't test these Avery Re-hesive labels to rate their durability as address labels for letters and packages.Out of the entire sheet of labels I printed, two couldn't be removed 'easily' - or at all. The other labels worked exactly as advertised by Avery - easy to remove and reattach. These labels print in three columns on an A4 size paper and are exactly likeAvery Easy Peel White Mailing Labels for Laser Printers, 1 x 2-5/8 Inches, Box of 3000 Labels (5160)except that these ones are repositionable. So they can be useful as labels on electronic equipment like laptop, iPad, cell phone etc. But if you do not need to remove and attach the labels again then AAvery Easy Peel White Mailing Labels for Laser Printers, 1 x 2-5/8 Inches, Box of 3000 Labels (5160)are less than half the price and non Avery like3,000 Name and Address Labels, 2-5/8" x 1", Same Size as Avery 5160are even less expensive. These labels work as advertised. It worth noting that these labels are to be used on LASER printers only.I use them for return address too. I would purchase these again if I needed repositionable labels for our business. Those labels didn't stick well to begin with and tended to curl inwards from the edges, requiring constant smoothing down. These labels do what they say. Since I have always found Avery labels and the free Avery software to be excellent, I was pleased to be able to try these.They come in a rigid cardboard box which opens easily and provides good storage. The labels themselves have a matte finish. The labels were easily repositionable on every surface I applied them to! I used the Avery re-positionable labels this year and discovered that they actually do work. Thus, Avery has come up with the repositionable labels. These labels are more adherent than their removable labels (which I also love) and I have had no problems with the edges peeling up or worries that the label would peel off during shipping. If you work with labels regularly you will appreciate not needing to attempt to lift the edge of a label with a fingernail, or tearing carefully after folding a perforation so that you don't accidentally rip the sheet. The labels stick well but are also easy to reposition. It allows you to use the labels on other items, such as inventory or medicine jars, food containers, etc. Nevertheless, you can't take it for granted that these labels will never damage a surface, and I'd suggest being careful with "pulpy" looking surfaces.Avery makes software freely available for using these labels. With typical labels, there's not much to say in a review. Avery labels are always great and these are no exception to that rule. When using such labels on cardboard, I recommend the non re-hesive type from Avery or another brand.B
