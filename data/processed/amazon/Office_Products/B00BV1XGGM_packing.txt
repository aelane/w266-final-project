I found this packing tape to indeed be thicker, stronger and of a better quality. I use clear packing tape all the time for office boxes. This packing tape is completely translucent and crystal clear. As a packing tape it is definitely a good item. Corru-Grip Premium Hot Melt Packing Tape is very strong packing tape. You can buy heavy-duty packing tape for about 1/2 the price per yard as this tape costs. With that being said, if you absolutely need the strongest packing tape you can buy, then I would recommend Corru-Grip Premium Hot Melt Packing Tape. I've used packing tape before. This packing tape is the most heavy duty of any I have purchased. So I recommend when you are packing to use regular packing tape for standard packing and save this for irregular packages and over or under-filled boxes as this is the special application for which this extra adhering tape is intended. This is a decent packing tape, & it is SLIGHTLY better than the generic brand I normally use. This packing tape is the perfect thickness. Very strong packing tape is not needed for every package, but is a necessity with particularly valuable or fragile shipments. But if you're looking for strong, effective packing tape, perhaps you should be prepared for that. This is good strong packing tape that is perfect for sealing boxes that I send in the mail. I used it both in a packing tape dispenser as well as just cutting the tape with a scissor and both ways worked fine.This is made in the USA which is always a plus. It is thicker than the packing tape I normally use and seems like it is made to last. This is a good, strong packing tape that has good adhesive properties. This packing tape is good but it really feels rather 'generic', that is you can get a similar quality tape at Costco for a better price than one roll is being sold for here on amazon.

This is a very strong packing tape and it is easy to get it unrolled, even if you did not fold some over at the end after using it so it doesn't get stuck tight to the roll.

Yes, it's strong, and thicker than no-name packing tape found in closeout stores these days.

This seems like a good packing tape, being somewhat thicker and tougher than some others.
