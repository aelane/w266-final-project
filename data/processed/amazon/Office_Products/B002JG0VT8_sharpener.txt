I like this sharpener because it works with different lengths and sizes of pencils, holds a decent amount of shavings, and is reasonably compact for a child's desk. This is the first plug-in electric sharpener I've had in my home, and there's no comparison with the weaker battery-operated sharpeners. I bought this sharpener for my desk at home, but after seeing how small, quiet, and efficient it is I may have to exchange it for the sharpener I currently have for my classroom. It's also not as noisy as our old sharpener, and it has a deep storage bin for the shavings so you don't have to empty it very often. We are very pleased with this sharpener! He  reports this sharpener is easy to use, powerful, and is able to adjust hole sizes so that it can grind all different size pencils into tiny nubs (although the hole sizes aren't really labeled so it's sort of trial and error on which size to use).Size-wise this sharpener is fairly compact for an electric with nice vertical design to take up less space. If this electric sharpener breaks then I decreeing manual only going forward - still effective, less pencils destroyed for the sake of entertainment, and a good forearm workout for my son to prepare for little league season. This is a great sharpener. :(Overall it's a good sharpener and highly recommended. While this sharpener has a big foot print it can handle a nice assortment of differently sized and shaped pencils. Well when you have a sharpener like this, there is no excuse.We use it regularly on standard pencils, colored pencils, charcoal drawing pencils, and on occasion crayons.It is a great product, works well, and is well built.Not much more can be said about a sharpener...just be prepared as these are powerful, so you only need to insert the pencil for a second or two...much more and it will gulp it in.5/5 for me.

The sharpener dials to fit six different pencil sizes which is very convenient for the classroom.

The sharpener jams up and stops working.

This sharpener works, I would have given it 5 stars but sometimes you have to be careful how you hold the pencil.
