Sure, it is cute but the tape stays in the drawer most of the time, so it really does not matter what the dispenser looks like. This reusable tape dispenser is a nice handy size and extremely lightweight, so much so, that I don't think it would last long with kids, or even with some guys who have big paws. The tape appears the same as they've been making for years. It's good tape, but nothing new. To be honest, I just like the tape. The tape comes wrapped in cardboard inside this little dispenser, but the time I figured out how to get it apart and the cardboard out, I was afraid I was going to break the dispenser. The tape cuts easily, straight and the edge is smooth, not jagged. This is the cutest little tape dispenser and obviously it is designed for kids. The tape that is included is the 'magic' tape, which has a bit of a matte finish to it. The tape is fine. You can write on this tape with a pen, pencil or marker, which makes it great for labeling. Also, the tape holds up well for years without the early yellowing I've seen with other kinds of tape. This is the Scotch tape that we all know and love, in a fun newly designed case. It's transparent tape, it's good and what more can I say? 3M tape is the best there is. The tape dispenses smoothly and the shape of the dispenser is much more comfortable than the more rounded dispensers. Loved this little tape dispenser! This is a good tape for the small jobs, but does not hold up too well against some light heavy-duty jobs. The tape is standard Scotch Magic Transparent tape (Scotch 810) which they apparently now simply call Magic Tape, meaning it's not the yellowing cellophane tape which they now call Transparent tape, but rather the long-lasting tape that's safe to use on photographs and other items you wish to keep forever. But would I really pay $2.50 for 300" of tape when I can go elsewhere on Amazon and get three times the amount of tape for only double the price in a regular dispenser (that's $5 for 900" of tape)? You can tear tape off using the perforated edge. There's also the double-sided tape in the yellow package, removable poster tape in the purple package, Magic Plus removable transparent tape in the blue package, and the list goes on. The tape sticks, the dispenser dispenses, and overall the product works as advertised and promoted. Sure, compared to this new one, the old Scotch tape dispenser looks positively utilitarian, but there wasn't anything wrong with that. That said, the tape is the same, good old, trusty Scotch tape we all know and love, and it ultimately doesn't matter what sort of dispenser it comes out of. Good old reliable Scotch tape in a neon green whimsical dispenser that resembles snail. The tape cuts just as easily as it does on those unimaginative holders, and is easily refillable.My desktop is so full of rather drab but necessary  objects it's a  pleasure to add this snail.- Gail Cooke I said...its tape...she said but is so cute. "It's the exact same tape, just in a new dispenser that doesn't work any differently than the old one...But then as I was laying it out on the kitchen table my 14 year old daughter suddenly makes a beeline to me and says, "Oh, that's SO CUTE! The tape is good but like one of the reviewers had pointed out the dispenser is a bit shaky. It's tape, and it does the job it's supposed to. I mean, if you look at a standard Scotch tape dispenser, there is only one side. The tape is the same as any other roll of Scotch tape (the "invisible" type, not that old shiny stuff that yellowed and cracked with age). This tape sticks stuff together, as expected. There is little that sets me off but when the tape won't come off when I need it is a tad distracting. This tape almost sticks up saying "take me to your sealing." The tape is the tape! Their tape is easily the best value for the cost. The tape comes off the roll smoothly, and the cutter works great. This is a nice and well functioning tape dispenser. It's light and as easy as any other tape dispenser. What can you say about tape? The tape in and of itself is fine- it sticks well, it comes out of the dispenser cleanly. There seems to be less tape on one of this rolls than on a standard roll of scotch tape, and the dispenser doesn't do anything for me that a regular roll of tape wouldn't do. The tape itself is fine. The tape itself is the always-useful Scotch tape, with a disappearing matte finish and ability to be written on with pen or pencil. It severs the tape neatly without any real effort needed.The subtle circle designs on the site are pretty, and they give you a good gripping surface for when you hold and pull at the tape. Scotch tape is always a winner. The tape is sticky. The tape dispenser that I received looks like a purple snail. It fits well when you hold it and the tape is matte and transperent. The tape comes out easily, tears without leaving jagged edges and sticks to just about anything. The tape adheres well to the dispenser's cutting surface, so there's no need to search for the end of the tape. You can never have enough tape. Now I can keep tape on every floor.As for being "Green", this little gadget is refillable. This tape has good adhesiveness. I think that this tape dispenser makes me want to explore the very fascinating world of surface elasticity. Scotch tape is critical to life, a true utility only one step below duct tape. There really isn't much I want from tape aside from two things. This tape works just fine on both counts. It's dependable Scotch tape, and the roll, clearly designed for aesthetic appeal, still works fine. The tape itself appears to be the same classic Scotch tape, which works great. And with that, it looks like there is much less tape than the classic dispenser. The new "Scotch Magic" is a tape that comes in the original matte finish. While not really any different from the traditional tape dispenser, it does get huge points for cuteness. This Loch Ness tape dispenser will blow away if placed near a fan, melt if placed too near a coffee mug, and may just evaporate if used during an outdoor event. Ok, I may be exagerating, slightly.The tape is fine though! Nevertheless, if your looking for a cheap tape dispenser one notch above the truly disposable kind, then this manufactor/designor has found its target market. I suppose if you are going to have your tape dispenser on a shelf in the open where people could see it, this would have a practical use. The tape "cuts" just as easily as it does from a normal scotch tape dispenser. Overall, the tape is the same as it is in a normal dispenser, it's just a preference if you want your dispenser to be cute or just plain.O
