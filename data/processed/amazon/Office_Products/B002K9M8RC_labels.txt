These labels were no exception to this issue, but they did a fairly decent job of covering for the most part.Most of the time, I use a hand-held labeler for manila folders and that allows me to print a label with a custom width based on the text size. However, the 3M labels are nearly 3.5 inches wide which is well beyond most of my needs, so I feel like much of what I would be paying for is wasted. The labels peel off easily from the paper but don't peel off easily from the envelope, both excellent features, as far as labels go.These are also good labels for labeling folders and binder dividers. I love these labels! My labels were perfectly aligned and centered and there was absolutely ZERO smudging when I applied them to the file folders. These labels look clean and crisp and the edges are adhered firmly to the folder tab. These labels are fully compatible with the Avery 5366 template, though you can download a template for them if you somehow don't have the Avery templates. Otherwise, these are perfectly functional labels that should perform well in most labeling situations. Nice small white labels. I easily printed out some labels and stuck them onto file folders! As I've had smudging with some labels and not others using the same printer, I watch carefully for label quality and a lack of smudging when I try a new brand. These 3M labels passed the test with minimal to no smuding as soon as the page came off the laser printer. The labels also have a strong, permanent adhesive that adheres solidly to plain or more glossy, waterproof envelopes. The labels themselves are bright white and easy to read. These labels serve their purpose well. Otherwise, check out the "Super Sticky Removeable Adhesive" labels, which are probably the safer bet, especially if putting them on wood or metal file cabinets directly. We had been using the Avery labels and tried these with a laser printer. I particularly like that there are 750 labels in a pack--that is very convenient and keeps me from constantly reordering the product. The labels are spaced far enough apart to make quick access and peel off easily. Also packaged well so labels on pages behind do not peel up and stick to back of other pages as some folder labels have done to me in the past. Good labels. These labels are great. Overall I am very happy with these labels. These labels use the Avery 5366 template which can be easily found on MS Word or Corel Wordperfect for alignment of the printing. These are substantial labels on nice backing paper. I didn't buy these labels with the intent to actually use my printer on them, but rather, to hand-write on them. If you choose to print your labels, the directions tell you exactly what template to use and whatever else you need to know to print on them. The labels are nice and sturdy, and have a permanent stick. These labels are exactly what the description says: sticky little rectangles of white paper that are the ideal size to use as labels on file folders. These labels fit perfectly on the file folders, making reuse of folders easy. The labels are also thick enough that you can't see the prior print on tabs, if reused. These labels can be used in inkjet and laser printers, and there are 750 labels in the pack, which makes them a great value. The various 3M labels have all worked with the existing templates so far and slipped in and out of my printer with no problems at all. Great labels... Sooo much easier to use than the label maker where you type it out, print it, peel it apart, and then realize you've spelled something wrong! These labels are a good price, they go through the printer well, they're easy to peel off, they take ink/toner well, and they stay on. The labels are easy to remove from the printing page and are very sticky (so even if you accidentally peel the label before you're actually ready to stick it on a file folder - like I did - you can set it aside for a moment and the air won't cause the sticky glue side to start drying and lose it's tack like some of the cheaper labels I've used.) You get 750 labels, which comes out to just under $0.02 per label. For these labels, you can use the Avery 5366 template in Word. When you need different labels on a sheet, you can just download template 3300-H from 3M's website. If you need removable labels, 3M's Post-it brand sells theidentical labels in removable form. These labels make it easy to use MS Word to finally make my files look more professional. These labels were great and had a very good permanent backing. The labels are 0.6 x 3.4 Inches White, and the labels can be used with a laser or ink jet printer. There are 750 labels per package; 25 sheets-30 labels per sheet.The labels arrived nicely packaged inside of a cardboard type envelope. The labels are bright white in color and have a good amount of stick to them. I have printed labels using black ink as well as have used colored ink, either way - the labels hold the ink well and the letters are crisp and easy to read. The labels are dense enough that the old label print does not show through to the new label.All in all, these 3M file folder labels are a solid, quality product and are easy to use. I printed out some of these labels to organize my manila folders inside pendaflex folders in a drawer. The labels are very sticky and I can see them lasting the long haul; the folders will probably give out before the labels fall off! Usually I use the Avery Brand of labels, and when these came I was so excited to see that they have printed the compatible Avery label number right on each sheet. These particular labels correspond to Avery 5366. This makes it so easy to use with Microsoft Word.These labels are the perfect size for labeling file folders, but can also be used for return address labels. To be honest, labels are pretty much labels. The labels are definitely made with a strong adhesive so I had to reprint some labels when I was careless in putting the label on the tab. The labels are what you expect from 3M. The labels are permanent. These labels are great for renaming folders again and again. I wouldn't hesitate to use 3M again, even though I'm more used to Avery labels. The labels can fit three lines of text comfortably if you were planning to use them as address labels instead of just for folders. These labels run smoothly through my HP Photosmart inkjet printer, and they stay securely until I need to remove them. When I need to change labels, I simply remove the old label (which comes up without tearing my folder) and apply a new label. These labels are perfect for re-labeling those files.They are also large enough to be used for title labels for other folders, like printing out a e-book. They're less expensive than Avery labels. (there are 30 labels per sheet). But they work great as write-on labels too.These are both laser and inkjet compatible. I frequently use labels for business purposes, and I have used store brand and Avery labels on many occasions. These labels are the perfect size for printing titles to use on tabbed manilla folders, and they seem to have great sticking power.I would use these again without hesitation and would recommend them without hesitation as well. These labels will certainly meet your needs. It was easy to make the labels using my laser printer and they stuck down well and look really great on my section dividers within my filing box. These labels work well for what they are needed for. These labels work as described & intended. The labels are high quality and very white, and once stuck they stay stuck!Highly recommend. These labels printed wonderfully with my HP Deskjet 712C printer with no problems. The labels are matte finish.3M File Folder Labels do exactly what they are supposed to do. Make great labels with minimal fuss. Unlike other labels I have used before, these are all on one big sheet. These labels are a nice, clean bright white and adhere well. I use them for small labels on my lunch containers when I send them with my husband to work. These labels work well with standard Avery templates, and print very well on my low end ink jet printer. I love using these labels in my home office. These labels are also handy to use if you're trying to "go green." However, by using one of these labels over the envelope window or over the company advertisement, it's easy to use the envelope anyway. I've also used these labels on regular school folders, CDs, DVDs and food items to identify my products. There isn't much that I can say about these labels other than that they live up to the 3M Brand name. You get 750 white labels in this pack. You can put these labels in your printer, go to the companys website - [...] and find the templates for the labels and just print away. These labels stick are permanent and stick well.Another winning product by the well known 3M Brand! Usually I use the Avery Brand of labels, and when these came I was so excited to see that they have printed the compatible Avery label number right on each sheet. These particular labels correspond to Avery 5366. This makes it so easy to use with Microsoft Word.These labels are the perfect size for labeling file folders, but can also be used for return address labels. Great labels, work well in printers or for handwritten labeling. The labels adhered well to the folders. I've used Avery permanent labels for years, but after trying these new 3M ones, I'm one hundred percent sold.Each sheet has 30 labels per sheet and with 25 sheets that's 750 labels. It's hard to review these labels, because they are about like any other label.
