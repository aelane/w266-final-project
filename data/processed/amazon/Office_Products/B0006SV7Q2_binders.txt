I findthat with binders the problem it two fold. There are some binders that have a sliding bar to make it easy to open and this would have really made this product 5 stars. Second, I think that all binders should come with the curved plastic guides that keep the pages from sticking to the cover.I would recommend this binder, or upgrade to the Heavy Duty binder. For those of us who still use binders, these little things make a huge difference. Do it for the binders! Are they wearing binders? Some of the cheaper binders don't even last six months around here. Avery continues to make binders better than the bargain brands, and I'd say that they are totally worth the money!! The binders are sturdy, clasp well, and were in excellent condition when I received them. However, I did see these binders at a warehouse buying club last week for sale at substantially less. These binders are great but mine arrived without one single woman in it! The binders are just full of those women that are not good at fiscal/financial responsibility and have to have housing provided for them because they can not protect their assets and themselves from being taken and controlled by the top 1%. If you are tired of cheap binders with rings that get stuck instead of opening and closing properly, or that don't quite close all the way, you might want to try the Avery E-Z Turn Ring 2" Binder. I love these binders. These binders are quite well made with clear plastic pockets that allow you to insert an indentifier page or whatever in the front, back & spine. I decided to try Avery's "Durable" E-Z Turn Ring 2" binder.Like many other binders, this one has clear pockets on the front and back cover and the outer binding to accomodate identifying sheets. Where can I find binders full of 'em? These Avery Durable binders are indeed more durable and last longer, saving stress and money in the long run. I was pretty disappointed about the dented binders. Large and sturdy with gap free binders store contents in the proper alignment. As binders go, it's a fine choice. I love these binders. Some binders have springs that won't stay tightly closed so turning pages causes pages to come loose.There are two pockets on the inside of each of the covers, front and back, so loose pages can be kept there. With Avery binders, one doesn't have to worry about this happening.
