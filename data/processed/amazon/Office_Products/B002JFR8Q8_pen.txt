This pen was a pleasant change from a standard one-point pen, and the versatility of being able to choose from four different colors was novel. It has become my go-to pen for everyday jottings and lists. I only need to pull one pen from the drawer and I am able to mark four person's events on my paper calendar (to match my online calendar). I also like that this pen is a little bigger because I injured the nerves in my right index finger (I'm right handed) so holding a pen is a bit difficult for me. I hadn't seen any since then until this three pen set showed up on Vine. )This fat pen has only two drawbacks that it has always had: it is, indeed, too fat for some to get used to writing normally with it. I've had this pen in my home for years. Not the normal pen to use for writing, but one handy for the unusual times. They are slightly thicker then a normal pen but you get use to that fast for the most part. This is the same pen and I love it too. This pen is not an ink gel, which can be notoriously hard to write on certain surfaces. This pen will write perfectly until its dead, and in four colors, too, each color bold and brilliant. They do tend to disappear, however, but that's probably because they're a good pen and the RNs like them too!

I did not have to do that with this pen.

Before noticing this pen in this month's Vine offerings, I hadn't seen a four-color, medium-point pen in this particular style in decades.

The pen's colors are blue, black, red and green, and you access them by clicking on correspondingly color-coded buttons at the top of the pen.The standard use for such pens for adults are for color-coding hand-written notes for business and school.
