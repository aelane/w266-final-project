My board look nice and new again.All in all this is a great kit and must have for me. You can't spray a large board and expect it to remain wet for a long time for you to clean. So spray and wipe as you go, instead of just trying to soak the whole board and then wiping. I like that it dries quickly so that I can quickly use the board again, but I can see how it would be annoying if I'm using a huge board. I was surprised it managed to clean up this board. The liquid board cleaner helps. I have an old white board that is streaky after many uses with the dry erase markers and thankful for the spray cleaner that came with the package. Then, the dry-erase board got stained and nothing I tried got the stains out. I use a white board to leave notes for myself and notes for my husband. I usually have to wipe off the board, then clean it with alcohol, and then finally rub the last of the color off with a paper towel. I use a white board to leave notes for my son. It doesn't clean the board any better than the eraser, and it leaves behind a residue that I was only able to remove with a cloth.This is a nice set. The board also has little magnets where my wife and I can affix coupons. Since my white board had never been properly cleaned, the spray cleaner had to be applied more than once with a paper towel to wipe away the old markings, but it did a great job.
