Generic ink and refill schemes just suck every time. Not very much ink in the cartidge but it works well and looks great. I always buy Canon ink for my Canon printer and they always perform as they were meant to by the manufacturer. I am very wary about buying ink cartridges online. I don't like the ink tanks running low so fast even if the printer is just sitting without daily use, but the colors have always been dependable. Well this is canon own ink so the quaility is top notch and I have great photo printouts. Having genuine Canon ink has always produced the most predictable results. The ink seems to work well in the printer, however the cartridges really leak as you are putting them in, so be sure you are wearing rubber gloves when you install them. Buy the original Canon ink if you are using it for your photos.

As for buying the ink tanks, just buy all three colors in the set at the same time to qualify.Anyway, let me talk about the ink tanks themselves.

The three "BCI-6" ink tanks work in the Canon Pixma iP3000 printer.

These are official Canon ink tanks so you'll know they'll work well.
