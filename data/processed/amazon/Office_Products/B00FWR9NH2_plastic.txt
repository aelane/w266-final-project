Also useful is the clear plastic cover, which enables you to slide in your own, full-sized cover sheets in front and back instead of pasting on a label that will peel itself off. The plastic cover allows you display your own artwork (or use a template from the Wilson Jones website). The black/white plastic covering is not attached to the cardboard with adhesive and you can run your hands over the binder and see the plastic move and roll. It has clear matte plastic pockets on the front cover, back cover, spine. The plastic covering the binder was extremely thin and cheap. Under the plastic the body was composed of what I'd have to guess is cardboard.it looked cheap and felt flimsy.The design was very good, but the materials used were mediocre at best. I'm disappointed in the plastic covering of this binder. Also, there are four transparent plastic pockets (two on each inside cover, front and back), that I use to store pamphlets and brochures. It has matte-finish plastic sleeves on the front and back covers as well as the spine to hold a sheet of paper plus two pockets inside each of the front and back covers.The plastic sleeves are supposed to resist toner. The plastic for the cover and pockets held up better than I would have expected to be honest, as it is really thin, even to a decent volume of papers shoved in them. It has a clear plastic coating so you can insert a page with a title printed on it, or a picture to identify what is inside.It is not as durable as other binders that I have purchased for my kids for high school/college but it will be adequate for the purpose I had in mind. Even so, the plastic covering, not even the pocket itself, dented from my nail.I've used other Wilson Jones products, most are quite good.One issue alone wouldn't make me hate this. This is a small plastic notebook with round rings.
