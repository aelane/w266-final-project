perfect size for in lap use or personal use when working with the kids to teach them various mathematics and so on. It is a nice size and includes everything you need to use it right out of the package. This is the perfect size for what I wanted. Its small size makes it useful to put on the fridge or other places (ours is hanging by the door to the garage where we can put notes to each other). It is just the right size to easily view what is written without overcrowding what is behind it. * Good size for everyday use* Light yet sturdy construction* Mounts easily with included magnets or double sided foam tape* Additional pair of magnets to hold notes against the board* Dry-erase pens wipe clean quickly and completely* Reasonable price* Works well both horizontally and vertically It's  just the right size ....not real big but just big enough. I wanted this size of white board to carry along to in-home trainings. The Quartet Magnetic Dry-Erase Board is a good size to use on a dorm door, a refrigerator for reminders, or in our case, to act as a small drawing board for the kids. I do really, really like  the size and design, and it's cute, I was just not happy that it was rather poorly constructed and not as durable as I'd hoped. It's also a decent size to hold on your lap to draw/write if desired. Perfect size for our small kitchen.Can't do without now! This is the perfect size for the front of our fridge. It is the perfect size, comes with multiple mounting options (I wish velcro was included) and the marker writes smoothly on the surface.It's just what we needed for our 'to do list'.
