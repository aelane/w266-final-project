I received this product as part of the Amazon Vine Program.I love Avery product and this is no exemption.The bag topper idea is great but it is no so practical.First you need to go their website for template and then you need to designand then print them. I really like this product. I'm thrilled with this product and can see myself using these a lot in the future.Edited to add:  I'm disapointed to now learn via the Avery website that the bags are not food safe. I'm hoping perhaps they change this product in the future to make the bags food safe because otherwise, my experience with them was great. I would definitely purchase these again, but use them when I had a specific product in mind (simply because the size is odd and won't fit everything! Such a neat product idea. It's great to be able to make my own product bags. I'm really happy with this product! Nice product. And I like the product. Not only does this Avery product provide bag toppers, they also provide the bags to go with them. If they don't feel that's necessary with this product, perhaps more than ten sheets of material would have been a better offering, since the software is best tailored to making many copies of the same sheet.The labels themselves are symmetrical, although you are free to have a different design or text printed on each side.
