This little pad is to be used with the App - Ampad Shot Note. as you would normally on the small Shot Note pad and then use the app to take a picture of it. The pad does not get used for anything else. Having one very distinctive pad in one very specific place has helped us get organized. This is a pad of 40 sheets of 5x8 paper that you can doodle on, draw, take notes, or make lists. Each pad has icons in each corner making it easy for the app to adjust the photo so that it appears to be perfectly centered, squared and bird's eye view. At least no more so than any other pad of paper. This is a nice 5 x 8, wide ruled, one sided pad. But I don't see lining up the pad as one of the great problems, certainly not enough to spend money on. A comparable writing pad from Wal-Mart or Target can be had for $2 (or 25 cents if you buy during back-to-school sales). I don't know why you would need a special pad of papers to do what this says it will do, though. As a pad, it is OK, but nothing special. This little pad of paper, which features lines and registration marks, is supposed to help you digitize your notes and doodles when you download the free Ampad Shot Note app to your phone or tablet. I've never used a writing pad that's specifically designed to be uploaded to a handheld device before but I thought it was a great.

The pad is just a pad of paper with guides for picture-taking.

The pad is also expensive.

You could buy a note-sized pad of paper for a fraction of the cost.First you have to download the free app Shot Note.
