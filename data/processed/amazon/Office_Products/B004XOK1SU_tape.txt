I used to hate working with that tape, and now it's just as easy to use as any other tape. My old wide tape dispenser was both complicated and painful - the tape would wend itself the wrong way and then it would hurt your hand on the sharp teeth as you tried to tear it off. I also think it will last forever,  so this is the last tape dispenser I am likely to get (unless of course I lose it,  that's always possible) This Scotch tape dispenser lets you unroll packing tape, and has metal teeth at one end for a clean cut once you've unrolled the amount you intend on using. It's easy to put the tape on the device. The tape goes in to place-then is cut off easily. This is a very basic, but effective tape dispenser. Before this I was using those smaller semi-disposable tape reels with the sharp teeth protruding out on the front, I am sure you know the type. It is much easier to cut the tape with this design when you are doing lots of boxes.It should be noted that despite the price tag you do not get a complimentary first roll of tape so order some if you don't have any extra around of the larger rolls. Taking packing tape by hand, pulling out an estimate amount of length, and cutting with scissors. This worked well however sometimes the tape would intertwine around itself which means that tape could no longer be used.Easy of Use: 8/10 (however, too many steps)2. This tape dispenser is easy to use. I like that it is not bulky like other tape dispensers that I have.This tape dispenser is made in the USA. I already have a tape gun, but for taping and sealing boxes or large envelopes to mail, find it difficult to use since it demands both hands for most operation. This is a decent tape dispenser. The "tape brake" handle is a nice feature for stopping the tape travel when you're at the point where you want to cut the tape. This tape dispenser is very ergonomic and easy to use. This is a convenient tape dispenser. The 2" tape is what I use most often when I'm packaging up items to be mailed and is perfect when I'm boxing up items to store. Very easy to load tape onto the dispenser, and sealing a box is much simpler than using tape freehand. Once she figured that out, she said it was fine, but would take a little getting used to it.Installing the tape is easy. Best tape dispenser ever. The tape spool goes on in a jiffy but you have to wrestle with it to get it back off again.Those little "arms" underneath the tape feed bar are designed to catch the loose end of the tape & prevent it from falling back onto the roll. If the tape sticks back onto the roll, it is extremely difficult to peel it up and get it started again. I think it was easier to put tape where I wanted it with my old, smaller dispenser. That keeps the tape from adhering back onto the tape roll. If you have a premium tape, the dispenser becomes a little less significant. Just pull the tape over the box and cut with the blade.I work at a print shop with the big fancy tape guns that cost a lot more but this does the same for a fraction of the price. Sure &#8211; but that&#8217;s not the tape dispenser&#8217;s fault.I&#8217;m surprised to see how quickly I&#8217;ve acclimated to this new style of dispenser. This tape dispenser is made out of really sturdy plastic -- not the cheap, thin brittle kind -- and will stand up to continuous and heavy duty packing and boxing with ease. The tape is always ready for the next use--there's no need to pick at the roll to locate the cut end!This dispenser is made of a heavy plastic that feels very solid and substantial. My old tape dispenser was not as easy to use. There is not much you can say about a tape dispenser. It keeps the tape from sticking to itself when you are packaging and it has metal teeth to cut the tape. It&#8217;s huge an unwieldy and the tape always manages to stick to the gun or itself.Enter the Scotch Box Sealing Tape Dispenser. No more struggling with tape sticking to the gun. It has a tape keeper so you don't ned to find the end of the tape every time you start packing. And I always have bought expensive tape with the cutters built in ... but the whole thing was disposable.At the same time, I always noticed that my movers used cheap cheap tape rolls. You just pop the tape in and pull the end through very simple tabs. I actually thought there was more to threading the tape into the dispenser, but there isn't.Anyway, overall, this is a joy to use. And you can get less expensive tape to start with If you're using box-sealing tape on a daily basis, spend the money for an industrial dispenser. It holds standard tape that is up to 2 inches wide, and features a replaceable blade, which is the only part of the unit that isn't made of plastic. I love it for using the filament tape on heavy box edges and around the circumference, it also works great for affixing Ebay style shipping labels. The tape then slides though a gap in the dispenser and is easily cut by the blade. The tape rests on the gap so you don't have loose tape sticking to things. This is quite the tape dispenser. The tape dispenses smoothly and cuts well. It will take tape up to 3/4 inch deep. This tape dispenser is easy to use and is much less bulky than a traditional tape gun. I never enjoyed using tape guns because they often became gummed up, the tape would get tangled, and they were sometimes awkward to use.I was surprised by how lightweight, yet sturdy, the Scotch tape dispenser was. I think it's much easier to use than a traditional tape gun. I found it easier to grip and control the tape, so I didn't end up with tangled tape. The tape was easy to load, too.However, I took it to a friend who has an online store and she was not as impressed. I'll stick with the new Scotch tape dispenser and she can keep her tape gun. I have one of the bigger tape dispensers with handle, but always hated how heavy and bulky it was. The tape didn't always flow out smoothly either. I also love that it's easier to control the tape tension at the point of where it's actually coming off the roll instead of eight inches down with some of the other tape dispensers. Less likely for the tape to turn in a direction I don't want and less waste since I can cut see closer to where the tape is cutting.

I never thought that I would get so excited about a tape dispenser.

I have just been using tape without a dispenser.

It's also easy to load the tape.
