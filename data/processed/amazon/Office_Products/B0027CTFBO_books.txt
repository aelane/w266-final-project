I've organized all my old books and stuff lying around in my attic, and now store them in these boxes. They're relatively sturdy, although I wouldn't pack one entirely full of just books. I filled them with books and other heavy items and the boxes took the weight without a problem. I filled two with VERY heavy books and stacked them and they held together. They might even survive the heavy books long term if they aren't stacked too high and/or the box is filled completely so that it cannot colapsePracticality:  I wouldn't use them for something I needed to access often because the lid is a bit clunky since you can't totally remove it and it sticks out from the sides when you open the box. These are too big for books as a normal person couldn't lift it if it was full of books. I have a few thousand books, but I'm managed to arrange things so that almost all are on shelves. I varied what I put in them from books to ornaments and clothes but I thought they did a great job and were also neat looking when I stored them on top of each other. So we are putting books in the bottom half, and tossing other, light weight items that must be moved into the top (globes, stuffed animals, wrapped dishes, etc).The good thing about these is how easily they are assembled.

She loves to keep old books, magazines, games, and more and usually they are just stacked up in a corner of our house somewhere.

I've used them for packing books.
