Happy with my bic 4 color pens. And then when I finally got my own, I needlessly depressed each and every color many many times, each time reveling in the little *snick* *snick* as the action worked, before curiosity eventually got the better of me and I opened it up to see how it managed its tricks. They aren't real bulky even though they are wider than a single color pen. And hey if you run out of one color you likely have another. Changing from one color to another is not cumbersome at all. Easy to change from one color to another. Blue.If a color runs out, not problem, they are refillable.Who might benefit from 4 colors in one?Hobbyist.Genealogy: I use a different color for different family groups.Greeting cards: My wife sends lots of greeting cards, not done as much in today's tech world, but people like to get them. She matches color to the card for personal notes.Recipes: Important features [temp & time] in red, Ingredients another color, directions another. You can easily organize and switch a color all in one pen. These are the classic four color Bic pens you remember from your school days. If you need a 4 color pen then worth trying, inexpensive and works well. Bic 4 color are some of my favorite pens to use.
