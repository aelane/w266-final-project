This ink is great quality. I ran out of ink and purchased these locally, so I am very appreciative of being able to get them here on Amazon for less. Since ink costs so much, I normally keep an extra one on hand (especially the black ones), since they always run out at the wrong time. but I do know that it is cheaper than the ink needed for my previous [now broken] all-in-one ink jet. I am concerned that while I do not print much the ink might go bad before I use all the ink that I am led to believe these cartridges hold. The ink alone is of good quality and produces good pictures on my non disposable color ink jet printer. Love these ink cartridges. I really like not having to replace ink so frequently.Most of our printing is single-sided, but some is double-sided. Genuine Epson ink is the best deal. The first ink cartridge (the Epson 126) barely lasted 2 months. The ink cartridge is literally twice the width of the 126 cartridge. At least, if you're out of black ink and this cartridge will fit your printer. The HP ink I had to use in my HP deskjet was thin, damp and ran like crazy. This ink for my Epson Workforce 840 is bright and never runs even if it gets wet. It lasts at least as long as the HP #2 ink cartridges did.I am very suspicious of off brands and refilled cartridges because of what I've heard--mostly that they leak and the ink quality isn't very good. Since the ink in an open cartridge will dry up over time, if the printer is used infrequently, it doesn't pay to buy larger, slightly more expensive cartridges. Great ink at a great price. I do believe this is excellent ink for the original OEM ink, however we have found the ValleyBuy ink is a good quality for a good price and the New Remanufactured ink is also of good quality for an exceptional price (about 10% the cost of OEM ink) HOWEVER according to Epson use of non-OEM ink will void the warranty so that's something to consider to... This ink works as it should and the output is nice. The ink cartridges seem to last a reasonable length of time. I think ink is way over priced and run out entirely too quick. I hate reviewing ink. What can one say about ink cartridges? Expensive ink like the rest of the major printer companies. I ordered this ink refill through Amazon. It works fine, but ink is so expensive and it does not last. What more could you want in an ink cartridge? We all have to buy ink for our printers and every time I do I have to gasp just a little when I see the price! Epson ink for an Epson printer. This Epson ink worked perfectly for us. Good ink, longer lasting than the 126. I will continue ordering ink from online for my printer. I buy the OEM ink to avoid printing problems; HOWEVER, the last one that I bought was defective. It leaked black ink all over the inside of my printer.Amazon is amazing and is exchanging it for a new cartridge. That means I also lost half the ink from the color cartridges as I had to re-print the entire job.I've never had this problem from an OEM cartridge before, but it only takes one to change my opinion and leave me severely disappointed in Epson. It's ink, what is there to say, it's name brand, prints well, plenty of capacity. There isn't much to say here except to say this is quality ink. I have an Epson Workforce 840 and use this ink. Usually i buy generic ink for all my other printers but this specific printer i recommend you spending the extra cash and getting the Epson brand ink Great ink, does what it says. I did not save enough with the generic ink to pay for the new Epson, so i'm done with the generic refills. I don't know; maybe some ink drips all over the place or something.

I always use OEM ink, because I have yet to buy a generic that didn't ruin my printer.

Epson DURABrite Ultra ink prints nicely on plain paper and photo paper alike.

Great ink.
