This sharpener is really heavy duty, not too noisy. It's definite a sharpener that means business, but one that the kids can operate.I love that it has different size settings and a large shavings holder. I would definitely recommend this sharpener to anybody looking for quality. I really needed a sharpener with adjustable openings for the Tri-Write and other "beginner" pencils that are thicker than average. It wasn't until we tried using this solid sharpener that the task became easy. I ordered it from Vine thinking it was a normal-sized sharpener and I dont have room on my desk to give up for it, so I store it away. But since this is a commercial sharpener, a lot of different people will use it and they are going to see inconsistent results.We placed it in a high school office for a week. The sharpener is heavy enough that it doesn't dance across my desk. However, I fully expect this to be last pencil sharpener I'll ever need, and I don't plan on going anywhere for a long, long time! I had a small electric sharpener on my desk; the kind you can get at most office supply stores for around 10 or 15 dollars. But that older sharpener took forever to sharpen a pencil and it often overheated and stopped for a while. The Bostitch is easily the most powerful sharpener I've ever used. This sharpener is garbage. Don't buy this sharpener. This is my 4th sharpener I have purchased. You could call this sharpener an elegant power tool - it's very quiet & pleasant looking, but it is heavy-duty. This Bostitch sharpener really does sharpen in about 2-3 seconds, with a perfect point every time so far for me (and my kids! This sharpener works quickly and smoothly. I gladly replaced it with this sharpener!
