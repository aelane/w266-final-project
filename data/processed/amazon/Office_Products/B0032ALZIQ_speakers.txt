I've never owned a laptop with upgraded speakers, like Harman Kardons, but I imagine that this is on par with something like that.As for the fan, it's absolutely silent and seems to do an OK job. I could care less about the speakers. I have a Toshiba that has always had horrible speakers. Don't plan on blasting these speakers though, or you'll get unpleasant distortion and crackling.As good as these lapdesk speakers are, I don't think they can match the quality of a pair of good stand-alone speakers.The volume controls are rather quirky, making it hard to raise or lower the volume in small increments. Having speakers--and pretty competent stereo ones at that already built into the unit--is a big plus.FUNCTIONALITY:The design is excellent and well thought out. Since the speakers are adjustable, there are little buttons to the right of the right speaker to adjust volume as needed. The speakers remove for cleaning.COMFORT:I thought, at first, that it might be a little large for a small computer like mine. It also has very small speakers that I have to use at full volume to hear.

But the speakers on the Logitech Lapdesk are EXCELLENT.

The actual speakers are embeded at the top left and right of the Lapdesk (you're also told to keep your fingers off them, for obvious reasons.

The speakers produce excellent sound, considering how small they are.
