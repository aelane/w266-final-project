Nice bright colors, enough color to be noticeable but not enough to drown out pen/ink. It tried to approximate their colors, so for example, an orange-yellow was recognized as a yellow. The colors are very bright and vivid--I love that! The colors are nice and most ink colors show up well.If you are familiar with the Evernote application or have been wanting to try it, the free trial is a nice bonus. I also enjoy the pretty colors of the different pads. These stick very well and I love the nice bright colors. Nice, bright colors, a standard size, very cool as always. They come in 4 delicious colors so you can categorize. These colors are very eye-catching when placed in strategic places. They coordinate with Evernote, and you'll need to refill with these colors to continue to use that feature. The colors were bright and fun and they worked great. I like the vibrant colors of this set of Post-it notes. I do think that if you used the same colors of Post Its NOT with Evernote written on the back, Evernote would recognize these colors and catalog them correctly, but I haven't tested this yet.
