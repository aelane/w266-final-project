This printer is not perfect, and in particular, the color accuracy is better on my Canon Pro9000, but the Canon printer also costs a fair bit more. However, I am lucky to have a separate printer stand next to my desk, so the large size does not take away my needed space. What is great about this printer is the cartridge system. Overall I am very happy with the printer. It takes forever to print and I've tried tweaking the printer. "We have an HP all in one printer that doesn't take up as much surface space.Following the simple instructions-for-dummies, we were able to set the printer up in no time. This printer is great at printing color photos. This printer even took about 10 minutes to calibrate after I loaded the ink.The software that comes with this printer is bloated. Although, HP says this printer can print 32 black and white documents a minute, that does not take into account the time it takes for the printer to calibrate itself. This printer is full of surprises. It is bigger than any printer I have ever owned, including our old clunkers from the early 90s.One reason it is so big is because it can accomodate very large page sizes, all the way up to 13" x 19". I specifically selected this printer because its specifications include Vista compatibility. I have installed the printer on both my Vista notebook computer and my Windows XP desktop, and the installation processes were identical. I installed the printer first using a USB cable, but then immediately substituted the USB cable with the optional Bluetooth adaptor for both my XP and Vista computers. Too often, HP printer software has constituted "bloatware" that I eventually removed from my computer. This is easy to do with this printer--there is a snap-off panel on the back that makes it easy to remove a sheet of jammed paper.The ink cartridges are easy to insert, and in fact the whole printer is very intuitive as far as taking it out of the box and setting it up is concerned.The LCD display on this printers, and its built-in menus, are the best that I have seen for any printer. I am sold on HP Vivera printer inks. Fairly quick printer. The printer automatically enlarged the photo (and cropped it) to fit a 3.5" X 5" photo on a 4" X 6" paper (used one of the 3 Hp photo papers that came with the printer. This printer does a lot for you without asking you first.

But if you place this printer on your desk next to your computer, the footprint of this printer will likely occupy a large portion of your desk.

This happened twice on my printer and, both times, the output tray swung back downward with such force that I had to check that the plastic hinge on the output tray did not break or crack.

The B8550 printer also includes a "Creative Projects Guide" booklet that describe how you can use the included ArcSoft Print Creations software to create photo album pages, calendars, placemats, greeting cards, and frames.
