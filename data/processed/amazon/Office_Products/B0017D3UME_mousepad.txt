I think this mousepad is really cute, it's bright and the wrist pad is very comfortable. It is not a flimsy mousepad. This mousepad makes it a little more fun. The mousepad itself is another added bonus -- the plastic design clings to whatever surface it is sitting on and doesn't move. So I needed a mousepad, just like in colonial times. The mousepad is actually extremely high-quality - the surface is covered with a hard and durable plastic finish, and the underside of the mousepad has an excellent non-skid surface. This mousepad offers a generous space for mouse placement. I much prefer it connected to the mousepad than having a separate one.I'd love to see these in different patterns and colors.

This mousepad looks good, bright pink with pretty flowers.
