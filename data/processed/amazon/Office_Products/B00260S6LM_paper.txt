The paper has a good tooth to it, but not to much to make it rough while drawing. This paper has a fabulous &#34;feel&#34; to it. )Each paper sheet is delicately perforated, so you can tear out neatly and with a clean edge. With just-right paper thickness, a matte finish to the paper that easily handles charcoal sketching and ink or watercolor work, a wire spiral binding that makes it possible to &#34;open wide&#34; to any page, this is an excellent sketch diary. The paper was fine for ballpoint ink pen, lead pencil, Prismacolor artist pencils. I think the paper weight is just right and there are plenty of sheets. The larger format paper notebooks make it harder to scan my notes This format is perfect. It's rare to see high-quality paper here, but this sketch diary reminds me of those French sketchbooks I loved so much. The paper is a nice substantial weight, although not thick or textured, and it has some &#34;surface&#34; to it. The paper is worthy of whatever you put on it. The paper is thick enough so we don't have to be concerned about a sharpened pencil slicing through it. The paper was too thin and began curling with the first stroke of the water brush. The paper does get a bit wrinkled if you use water colors, but there are other books with different paper weight for that purpose.The 9x6 size is very convenient to toss in a purse or backpack so you can take it along on field trips.The notebook is well made; the spiral wire is good quality and stays where it's supposed to. The paper is of heavier weight, acid and lignin-free and lightly perforated. The paper is thick, and the pages are perforated for easy removal. The paper is not too thin and it's fairly sturdy and I like the wire binding I wouldn't recommend painting or other heavy media but ink and pencil work great. Each paper is perforated at the edges so that it can be easily detached without ripping anything unnecessarily.

Finding paper that doesn't fall apart on me is a lovely thing, and the reverse side of the drawings I made on this Mead Academie Sketch Book only show slight indentations, so this is strong, heavy paper, even without the lignin!

However, the paper does warp and curl when wet, but holds together.

The paper has enough grit to hold color pencil work; yet it is still comfortably smooth.
