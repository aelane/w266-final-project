With this on my wrist it made wrapping much easier. Unless you want to walk around with it around your wrist your whole life, it's probably not going to be around when you need it, but it will be worth finding and strapping on when you've got a bunch of gifts to wrap or a similar project that requires several small strips of tape. It can be strapped across your wrist or on your knuckles, just beneath the fingers, but I have found that if I place the handband around my knuckles, it restricts the blood flow a little bit and I begin to feel tingling. It can be worn either on your wrist or across your fingers, and the elastic band is wide enough so that you don't think the thing will snap in two. It also fit on my wrist perfectly and I found it just as easy to use and it was more comfortable than on my hand. It was very convenient to carry on my wrist from room to room, while keeping both hands free to carry my packages. Just put this on your wrist and off you go! This wrist band works as advertised and is certainly an improvement over the cheap plastic disposables, but offers little or no improvement over the weighted model. Not this wrist tape dispenser. Having it on my wrist is a bit dorky, but it's very convenient and keeps the tape nicely within reach. I've been wearing it around my wrist while I wrap a ton of little gifts, and it's very convenient. I was able to wear it on my wrist a little more comfortably, but found the convenience not much different than having a more versatile desktop tape dispenser nearby.When I put the unit down, it often ended up with the "wrong" side down,  causing the tape poking out to stick to the dispenser itself.While I'm usually a gadget-freak, this unit is a little too specific without adding much function. It's right on your wrist! The wrist strap is elastic and comfortable. The wrist band is a simple but worthwhile invention.The only reason this will not get a full 5 stars from me is the price. The elastic is soft, and it's not tight on my wrist.
