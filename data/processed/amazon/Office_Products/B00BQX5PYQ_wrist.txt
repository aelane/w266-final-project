I'd been needing a wrist rest for my mouse for some time when this became available through the amazon Vine program. My old 3M Gel Mousepad Wrist Rest was really getting bad, and hurting my wrist, so I decided to give this a try. Of all the wrist rests I've had, though, this one is my favorite. Since my wrist would start hurting while surfing the net I started looking in to protection for my wrist. Some wrist rest out there were too stiff or too soft. This wrist rocker from Fellowes works great. Aside from that it is very comfortable with a soft wrist surface and it really does keep my wrist cool.The mouse surface on this pad is very slick and offers almost no resistance so you can work for long periods without strain or fatigue. It is comfortable for the wrist to rest upon and does provide a softer surface for your hand. I tend to have wrist issues when working on my iMac for a long time. The wrist rocker is a softer plastic that cushions my wrist while supporting it and rocks back and forth for easy mouse manipulation. The wrist section being of some sort of plastic was irritating to my wrist initially and I was going to cover it with some flannel cloth, but didn't get a chance to as I was sick for a while. My wrist lays and moves comfortably on this mousepad and I have had no problems using my cord mouse like other users seem to be saying. The wrist rest - the canolli part - is a sheet of soft plastic rolled over itself. No wrist rest or mousepad is a cure, but this actually works for me. And the wrist rest is made of a flexible material that supports but gives at the same time. The wrist cushion is quite comfortable. My wrist sits in comfort on the soft support. I find that my wrist rests quite naturally on it and I exert very little effort in making the mouse work.On a side note, I'd like to talk to the product team that came up with the package for this thing. the wrist pad is not a cushion. when you put your wrist on it, it flattens down and sinks in. It keeps the wrist and hand at a good angle and feels nice with a little 'bounce' to it to help keep your wrist happy.The mousing surface itself is very slippery, however the wife's cheap mouse has little round feet on it to slide on, and she says she can feel it catching on the pattern on the pad, and it irritates her. The wrist pad on this is soft and it's more comfortable than having no pad, but it is a bit high for my anatomy. If the wrist pad height was not a factor I would've given five stars. Indeed, it cannot be removed without breaking it or me.On April 25, 2013, I injured my right wrist -- my mousing wrist -- in an otherwise studly display of weightlifting prowess.On April 26, 2013, I received from Amazon aLogitech Wireless Mouse M310 (Indigo Scroll) (910-002482)to replace an old dead mouse and connected it to my desktop computer. I used to have one of those gel-type wrist supporting mouse pads. Your wrist will thank you for it! The wrist rocker is so comfortable it make the wrist relax so effortlessly. The Fellowes I-Spire Wrist Rocker is the most comfortable wrist rest I have ever used. This wrist rocker has a ridged, flat, hard mouse pad w/smooth contours.I found that by the end of the first week using this wrist rocker, I was getting a gritty feel (it felt like my mouse was scratching the pad surface. I have a gel wrist rest mouse pad, and this is far superior in comfort. I thought maybe I was supposed to remove the wrist rest and attach it to something, but no that's what it's supposed to be. The wrist rest, itself works much better than others. It is also longer and more flexible, even softer than the gel wrist rests I have used.I
