This board attaches via four double-sided sticky pads on the corner. I had thought the board itself is magnetic, but alas- it was not.The design is not obtrusive, and the color matches metallic, white, and black fridges very well. This board is great for keeping hobbies organized. This magnetic board is perfect, as it is a good size (14x14), and very lightweight. I want to hang the board on my wall, but I don't want to use the self stick pads and risk damaging my paint. Just a great, compact board. Definitely check the board out in the store before purchasing. Like this board. Its still usable but looks bad.Overall really like this board for our kids to-do lists! Somehow I missed that the actual board is silver. the board came with 4 3M double sided stick pads, which held it firmly in place when I installed it to the side of a bookcase by my office desk.Overall, I wish I would have paid better attention and ordered a white board, not a silver board, but I have no complaints about the quality of the board. I have never used a silver white board, so the appearance is a little strange, but the contrast between dark color white board markers and the silver is ok. The board comes with double sided sticky back tape for mounting. I used this instead, and now I can move the board around and from metal surface to metal surface. The board is light enough to place just about anywhere. Personally I've decide not to hang it anywhere but just use it as a mobile board and lean it up here and there when I need it.I need to go doodle now. The board is a very good size for the fridge, and the quality is very good. The board sticks to your refrigerator with sticky pads, so it's pretty much permanent once you put it up. It's a dry-erase board, nothing fancy, but I like the frameless silver design; makes it look very modern and sleek - not like something you would just hang in a little kid's room (although the colorful magnets looks a little tacky).It's pretty large to write many notes on it, as well as hang other notes with the magnets.The included marker is horrible - I could only write a few things and it wouldn't write anymore; the same marker was included in another Quartet board that I got and the ink on that one was died right away too. It does wipe away nicely, without leaving any black on the board's silver surface.Regardless of the fact that this dry erase board was not what I expected and not really what I wanted (my error, not the board's), I found its faults enough to give it only three average stars. The board comes with 2 magnets which are great but it only holds the very lightest of notes, (single note page, business card etc)  But for less than 8.00 I think it is a great, sturdy and solid product.This would also be a great gift if you purchased the other products in different sizes. Although the dry-erase board came in a large flat box with plastic air packaging, it arrived with four dents and a scratch as shown in the customer photos. Since the board isn't advertised to kids, the pen could stand to be longer.I love the frameless look and the silver board. I appreciated that it was stapled to the board or else it could've been easily lost.My youngest has a big board from an old easel. It was nice to have a dry-erase board actually erase! My board had 4 of them. This is a very handsome &#34;white&#34; board that is actually a single, smooth piece of thin metal wrapped around a frame. As such, it looks great, is magnetic, and it certainly functions as a &#34;white&#34; board. The board attaches to surfaces with sticky tape that comes with the board.I put mine on my refrigerator. Fortunately, a 14x14 board is also available for those looking for more space. This board is a good value for the money. This board is no exception, pen went completely dry after writing six words. So, the board itself is nice and I would recommend it if you are okay with providing your own marker. I may not always want my board in the same place. The board is small and not much room to write on, but if you are looking for a small discreet dry-erase board to hang in professional place or to blend in with metallic appliances, this one is a good choice. This board looks beautiful and performs beautifully.
