The D-ring binders are sturdy, and the fold-out of the front cover and spine enables me to stuff in more pages than I would without the fold-out. I've used binders like this for years and they have always performed well for me. As binders go, I expect this one to hold up to general office use. I highly recommend Wilson binders. Some binders come apart easily, but this one is holding up well after much use and a full load of pages inside. Compared to binders sold in stores, it's not a bad price, either. I'd recommend "Power Pink" for binders full of women. Almost all of my past binders have tearing down the spines, the inner pockets are tearing at the edges, and several of them have rings that won't close tightly anymore. Generally binders like this succumb to the cement-mixer like grind of books and motion. Having suffered with many inferior binders, I was glad for the opportunity to test out this Wilson Jones version. With so many NON-durable binders touting their &#34;Heavy Duty&#34; titles, I tend to skeptical. You get what you pay for with binders, so if you're going to spent more than $6 on a 2-inch binder, you're hoping it will last. When I travel, I use these binders for that memory book of photos. I have a few different Wilson binders and they tend to be on the pricier side for what you get, but this style is one of the nicer ones. The binders I used at first popped the hinges open just enough for the inserts to slide out every time I flipped though, so hinge strength is of utmost importance for me. I thought all binders were pretty much the same, until I got this one. These binders are pricey, but worth it. With so many binders available in this country that fall apart with not much happening, this is a good investment. These are the nice binders. I generally buy binders from the store for this reason. Some binders do not have the clear cover. Different binders are best for different purposes, so I will try to give a good idea of how this Wilson Ultra Duty one works.The cover material of this binder is a tough, but somewhat cheap looking plastic. Most binders say you can close with one hand using the tab inside but I've never actually had one that does until this one. I use binders to compile printed knitting instructions and knitting pamphlets/magazines that I have slipped into plastic sleeves. into separate, smaller binders. Most binders like this only have two. (I ordered binders in both 1-1/2&#34; and 2&#34; and am using the same review for both. The Avery HD binders have thicker cardboard in them so it takes a lot more force to bend the front and back covers out of shape. I tend to wear binders out quickly. When I had binders it was always a two handed job and you had to make sure not to get your fingers caught OUCH.The good is the one handed operation and the durability of the front and inside vinyl covers/pockets that allow to display a schedule or other important papers if necessary.The bad is the D-ring does not allow the papers to flow as smoothly as the old school 'O' ring. I've been hating my cheap three ring binders because the leaves tend to rip away after a relatively short time....or the rings get distorted from opening and closing.This heavier duty 'D' ringed binder is holding up well to my negligent treatment so far....will update a bit further along in its life.Okay, here's my update:  I shelled out my own money for another of these binders (different color) because these really are heavier duty and I like 'em.

In the past, I have struggled with binders whose rings constantly got stuck and gapped.

With some of these binders, it was also impossible to turn the pages in one fluid motion (the pages had to be flipped over little by little).

Some other binders I've used would start to have the rings not close correctly at this point, or show other signs of wear.
