I find that I don't really need much more than six pockets in my portable file, and so this was perfect for me. The six pockets are fine, and the file itself is great; however, I don't like how it closes. It is organized with six pockets which make it easy to sort what type of recipes you have. It is easy to label the different pockets. There are 6 pockets. With 6 pockets, there is a dedicated &#8216;folder&#8217; for each class. However, I felt the pockets were slightly small - I like to keep legal notepads in my files, and they don't quite fit into this folder.However, this is a great tool for my teenage children who always need help in organizing their homework assignments and keeping them neat. So I can label the five tabbed pockets with only one label left. There are 6 pockets but only 5 tabs (kinda important if you ask me). Twelve certainly seems better than seven.More pockets would mean more bulk.

Six pockets help to keep things organized.

Finally, the pockets themselves though solidly divided, are not attached to the bottom of the file, so that loose items or smaller items may find there way between divisions.

The pockets let me keep syllabus/admin material, current work/handouts, graded assignments, handed in assignments, and misc.
