It has two magnets, so it sticks well and does not fall off when you go to tear a page. It's got 2 magnets on the back that keep it in place. The two flat magnets attached to the rear of my pad measure under 1 3/4 inches each and they are as wide as is the pad (3 inches). The magnets hold well. There are two magnets on the back of the pad (one at the top, one at the bottom) that make it really sturdy.Unfortunately, though, I do agree that this notepad is just not as functional as it could be. But being that it has magnets, it is obviously designed to be placed at the refrigerator. I like that it is larger then other magnets so I can write on it. The magnets on the top and bottom of the Quartet Magnetic Notepad keep it secured to the refrigerator perfectly. The magnets are nice, there are 4 of them and it holds it securely to the fridge. The magnets work very well.There is a band at the bottom that can be used to secure the bottom of the reminder pad. And having the magnets on both top and bottom does make it hold better.The price would be reasonable, and I would gladly pay it, IF it were American made. The magnets are strong enough to hold the pad up on my refrigerator with no problems. The magnets are also not quite strong enough to keep a full pad attached to a refrigerator. It's nice and small and has magnets so it can go on your fridge and not really be an eyesore.

First of all, the magnets on mine are too weak.

It's really sturdy, with magnets on the back and even an elastic band at the bottom to bind the pages together.

The magnets hold it on your refrigerator (or the side of a file cabinet) nicely, AND, the bottom holds the paper in place.Why only three stars?
