I would recommend this printer for college dorm rooms as it would be perfect for printing school reports or papers while not taking up too much valuable desk space. I'm going to enjoy having the printer so close at hand. The printer recognized my network immediately, and I'm able to print from a desktop Mac, laptop Mac, and iPod Touch with no problem (here's hoping I can print from a new iPad after Xmas!). I could not get the printer to accept the configurations and worked at least 20 minutes before I found a broken piece of Styrofoam in the printer. After removing that, the printer took the configuration.Step three is to install the ink cartridges. Once you finish using the printer it easy to have the tray return to the inside of the printer, thus no projections exist.The 3.5 inch touch screen  makes it very easy to change your projects or printing. This is a  very nice small printer that I am liking more and more as I use it.There is a 30 page feeder on the printer, plus 2 sided print, copy, scan and fax. This small printer does everything my larger Epson Artisan printer does. This printer is doing it's job wonderfully. This is a great printer, but I still have a few complaints.As others have noted, I just don't understand the logic behind the extending tray. Here is a printer that achieves the two features that I want most: it is easy to set up (even the wireless network!) Yet here is a printer that you can have running ten minutes after you open the box.Epson got most things right. The printer is solid and the unit is smaller than what you'd expect which means it doesn't consume huge amounts of office real estate. While this printer follows the new normal of telling you when the ink cartridges are done (and refusing to print at that point), unlike lots of other units, the ink really does seem to be empty. This printer is great and does it all! This printer has an extra photo black cartridge. This printer&#8217;s usage is on par with similar printers I&#8217;ve tried.Print time is not superfast, but is acceptable. Apparently then it will configure the printer for the wireless network that your home or office was using, saving you the trouble. This is about sixth or seventh all in one printer I owned. But, as good as this printer's photo quality is, it wasn't good enough to replace Photomate.This is the best in the line of all in one printer so far. It isn't necessary to have a printer cable to set up the printer and I was able to set up the printer to our home wifi without a hitch. Like the XP-800, and any other Epson printer for that matter, you will plug through ink very quickly if you like to print out a lot. This is a wonderful printer. I've not used this printer with a wireless device, but it connected easily with our in-home wireless network and is being used by all of the computers (both PC and Mac) on it.Print speed and quality is on par with the 730, and after about a month of use, the initial cartridges are only about halfway through their ink. I've yet to find a perfect a-in-one printer, but for the price, this is close.~ Kort This is my third Epson printer, so I am a fan! I needed this printer for a small space in a compact office, and it works great. However, you might want to buy this printer only if your purpose is to have great photo printouts, along with other minor daily printing needs. I can move the printer anywhere I like to print, since it's also very light, without having to worry about the network wire.The paper tray is very thin and it holds only about 100 sheets of paper; not enough for frequent printing in an office, but more than enough for home use.It has a secondary tray that holds about 20 sheets of premium photo paper. I am pleased as can be with this printer, which I'm using with my Mac Air (and also MacBook Pro).I am a fan of Epson printers, and was happy to have the opportunity to review this model for Amazon. First of all, this printer seems bigger than the description, which was disappointing. My first printer was an Epson- the MX-80. This printer was far too difficult to set up. Here I had a nice new printer (or so I assumed) that I had no way of getting up and running. I think it is worth pointing out, though, that this printer has only five ink cartridges to load. This isn't my first Epson printer, and I got inky fingers from their cartridges in the past which prepared me for this go-round. If you want to use just one printer, I recommend the Epson XP-850 instead of the 810 because of the nuanced inks. This printer does it all, prints, faxes, copies and scans and it doesn't take up nearly the amount of space that most all-in-one units do. It'll be great when going on a trip.The printer does a beautiful job on photo paper and even does quite well on plain paper. This printer uses 5 ink cartridges: Black, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Photo Black. The printer cassette holds only 30 sheets of paper. Frankly, this little printer compares well, and even exceeds their ability.This little printer comes in handy for a quick photo or for everyday printing, faxing, scanning. We love this printer. I unplugged the printer and plugged it back in and the power button became functional instantly.Overall, this is a pretty neat printer whether or not you want to print photos and I recommend it without hesitation. Needed a printer so made an emergency purchase at the local Staples of the XP-810. While the printer sells for about $200, the ink could easily cost more than that every year if used regularly for photo printing. You can use it to set up a FAX printer, which will send a FAX of your document directly from your computer through the FAX section of the Epson, and on to the receiving FAX. Indeed, this printer makes business document printing its priority with its sharp, crisp text. though other printer models ink have slightly better availability. this is my fourth epson printer and I'm just as happy with this one as I am with the other three. This printer is nice and compact and prints great photos. It did not fit in my usual printer location because the tray would hit my monitor when it was fully extended. Finding the printer is also very easy via the printer-finder software on the included CD.The only thing I don't like is that the ink cartridges are not self-refillable. This printer, like all of them, is an ink glutton. The printer uses 2 low profile trays and automatically selects the correct paper for print jobs. I've only had the printer about a week and I can't possibly comment on total cost of ownership or reliability until I've used it for a few months. I don't know yet because I haven't had this printer for very long.What I have noticed so far (little bit random order):-It's an amazing piece of tech. Amazingly compact, but full featured printer. I also have an Epson Artisan 830 (have been pleased with it), so looked forward to this new more compact printer. This is a very nice printer with many desirable features as it is an all in one. If you give this printer a shot, you should be pleased. I got this to replace an older Canon all-in-one printer. Although it won't replace every printer and scanner I own, it makes for a very good home office tool. This Epson printer was the first one where I used Epson's iPhone app to manage the device, though, and so my review is largely based on my brief experience using this all-in-one with my iPhone.WHAT I LIKE:- This all-in-one does what you'd expect any all-in-one to do, that is, print text quickly with sharp characters, print photos with vivid and accurate colors, and scan quickly with accurate colors- The iPhone app lets me do most anything I'd ordinarily do using the printer's touchscreen interface or with a computer.
