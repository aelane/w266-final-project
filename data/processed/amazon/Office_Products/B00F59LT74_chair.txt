Overall, this is a nice chair with a lot of customization (via levers) for a comfortable seat. This is a really nice chair. The chair is sturdy. The chair pad is soft and comfortable and just so you know, it is highly contoured to fit your thighs. Overall, this chair is very comfortable and great quality and I would recommend it for anyone who spends significant amounts sitting at a desk. I was quite impressed with this chair when I was putting it together. It seemed to be as well constructed as my Aeron chair that costs eight times more. This chair is a good, solid, basic chair. Because of this, I'd definitely recommend it as a chair for someone relatively strong or who can find help lifting it. This chair is not meant for skinny people as it's way too wide for that. I recently purchased a similar chair in a similar price range (Lorell Executive High-Back Chair, Mesh Fabric, 28-1/2"x28-1/2"x45, BK), which is essentially identical to this. I received a free chair to try and review.I found the Basyx Mesh High-Back Chair to be a very comfortable chair with a thick seat cushion and nice soft/springy mesh back. I found this chair to be very comfortable and exceptionally stable. The chair quickly adjusts height to conform to either of us. My previous chair was leather backed and while it was comfortable it tended to become warm while sitting for any length of time. This chair remains cool with it's mesh back and the adjustable back support feature is very nice. This chair is easy to assemble right out of the box. The chair has several adjustable features: you can adjust the height of the chair as well as the width of the arms; you can tilt the angle of the mesh back; you can allow the seat to tilt back and forth or lock the seat angle; you can adjust the height of the back of the chair; you can slide the seat forwards or backwards; you can adjust the tilt tension; and you can adjust the height of the seat.The basyx by HOM HVL532 Mesh High-back two Way Arms Task Chair is a nice comfortable chair that I'm very happy with. It is a very easy chair to put together and adjust exactly the way you want - two of us use the chair and we both have no problem adjusting the chair to fit each of us. We use the chair in our home office and it is perfect for our needs. The chair is comfortable to sit in even for long periods of time - I have a bad back and can sit in this chair for hours without any discomfort. I chose this chair when offered because it looked like a cross between the nice chairs we have at the office but with adjustment levers and arms similar to what I have on my old home office chair, and I was not disappointed.Assembly was actually pretty quick, though it took us about 30 minutes, longer than other reviewers have noted. I've been very pleased with this chair so far. This chair has tons of adjustment options, from the height of the arm rests to the cant of the seat, along with the usual adjustments for height and recline. This chair's a pretty good value and serves its purpose well.PROS:* Assembly is simple and parts are nicely labeled. On this chair, you can independently adjust the seat tilt, back tilt, and width that the arm rests stick out. This chair's seat cushion is very comfortable to sit on. If you're going to sit longer than that, get a more expensive chair. I'm 5'3&#34; and the chair is comfortable enough for me to sit for several hours at a time. Assembling this chair was extremely easy, and it was set in my office in no more than ten minutes.While this chair has more gizmos and levers than any previous chair I've owned (with the exception of a headrest, however), there is one huge flaw for me: the seat cushion doesn't recline as far backward as I'd like. Also, the whole chair itself doesn't lower as much as I'd prefer, though it's got quite the height at its highest. I have a bad back and the chair fits my back perfectly because of the adjustments I made. I am very pleased with this chair and I highly recommend it! I LOVE this chair and I highly recommend it to anyone who spends a lot of time on their derierre. My HVL210 chair is a very comfortable well padded chair, but has no lower back support- just great cushy comfort. When I first saw this chair, I thought it was far too stiff with it's hard mesh back to be comfortable in- but I quickly found out just the opposite.This chair took about 12 minutes to put together. That's it- you are now ready to sit on the chair and adjust it to the way that feels comfortable to you.Each arm has an arm height adjustment, as well as an arm width adjustment. The chair back has a height adjustment. After sitting on the chair and playing with all the adjustments, I got the chair's back to be tilted back enough and the seat to be forward enough to give me total lower back support. It is also wonderful that Basyx gives this supportive 5 Star chair a 5 Year Warranty as well. This is the 2nd chair I own. I really like this chair. But, it is still a very nice chair.
