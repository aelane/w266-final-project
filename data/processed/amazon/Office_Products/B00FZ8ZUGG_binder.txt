This binder is pretty sturdy but the two inside pockets are a little loose and it doesn't keep the papers as snug as I would like. Other than that, this binder seems durable, it opens easily and the rings don't gap. This is a competent binder with easy to open D rings that shut securely. The binder has a sturdy feel and appears to be well made. This is a solidly constructed three ring binder that is ideal for home, school or office use. This is a really good binder. I hate when you get a binder and the hinges are slightly misaligned or have gaps, and every time you try to move paper in the binder it snags, rips, etc. This particular binder has D rings.Overall, I'm very pleased! Well made, sturdy basic binder with durable three ring clips. The binder has a plastic cover that allows personalization and labeling. This binder is solidly built. This binder should live an entire school year under heavy use. This is a standard binder. The binder is well constructed and durable. This binder might be good for school if the standard 1 inch binder isn't cutting it. It is a pretty sturdy binder that seems like it could take a little bit of abuse and still look pretty new. This is a strong well built binder with very sturdy rings, however it needed two hands grasping the central ring for me to open and close. I use this binder filling it almost to capacity so it is important to me that the binder works with a lot of paper inside of it, and that it will stand the test of time. This binder seems to do both. I hate having to throw away a binder every year because they fall apart with some use, this binder does not seem to fall into that category.I will say the only downside to the binder is the price, it is on the expensive end at 9$ a piece, but you get what you pay for. This is a binder that I think I will get several years use out of. This binder has good, quality construction. I've never had a D-ring binder before. Nice binder. The binder has &#34;D-shaped&#34; rings on the inside, which makes it very easy to operate and, in my opinion, helps the binder withstand a bit more abuse than the traditional &#34;O-shaped&#34; rings. Overall, I think the binder is quite durable, and I haven't had any issues so far. When this binder arrived, I liked it immediately. This 1 and 1/2  binder is durable and high quality. It's not a huge binder so its prefect for the amount I have. Especially when the binder doesn't fight them; it just lays flat.Good sized classroom binder. This heavy-weight binder will stand up to countless use by visitors to my exhibit at the annual Fair. I can easily determine which binder I have and visitor to my exhibit also see precisely what they are picking up. I am going to use this sturdy binder with Index separator sheets to hold all my craft projects that I print off of different sites so that I don't have to shuffle through pages of loose papers. A good basic binder that is sturdy is a joy to have.After reviewing a Wilson Jones binder that was substandard, I'm happy to report that this one arrived in near flawless condition. This seems like a very durable binder that will hopefully hold up over time. I received this binder at the same time as the 2&#8221; Wilson Jones Ultra Duty Round Ring View Binder with Extra Durable Hinge and I like this Heavy Duty D-Ring version much better. This binder, by contrast, is very nicely made. The binder doesn&#8217;t make a strikingly good appearance, but it&#8217;s not distractingly wrinkled and bubbled either, like the 2&#8221; Ultra Duty was. Overall, I am pleased with this binder. This binder is pretty good, but nowhere near durable or high enough quality to warrant the high price. This is a good binder in a size that holds quite a bit of material. My binder is white, but is easy to clean vinyl.Overall this is a good choice for those who want a 1.5&#34; binder. I have this binder in the 1 1/2" White option. I wouldn't bet on that but this binder does seem to be a bit better quality than many others out there on the market. Time will tell but I'd be surprised if these lasted much longer than any other binder out there.I have this particular Binder in the White option. For them, I have found that a flexible binder in general will make it farther though the school year. This is a solid binder, and HUGE. When open, the binder lies flat with D-Rings holding your papers, documents, and folders in place. This binder will serve its purpose for a while, but in comparison to older binders and even some newer ones I have purchased it rather insubstantial.T
