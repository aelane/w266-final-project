I did have to scrub, but the white boards scrubbed clean for the first time since they were new! My white boards at work are idle and worn with a serious "ghosting "  issue. Wonderful for white boards. For the white boards, they are a dream--so erase on. Big expensive white boards with proper LOW ODOR markers (do you know that the low odor markers need to be used on most boards these days?). The boards wiped right off. You will have to get new boards at some point. For older boards and for marker stains, you can wet these pads to improve their performance. If you use white boards frequently, this is a "must have" item. This is not to say that the boards were restored to mint condition. But the boards definitely looked amazing compared to their state moments earlier.The package the erasers came in said that for especially hard jobs, I should wet the erasers. Some boards seem more susceptible to it and one board in our conference room is quite nettlesome - it has doors that can hide the board and leave uncleaned markings "out of sight, out of mind" for extended periods. The boards are holding up well too, with no issues from using these. We use several white boards at work and are always looking for better ways to erase them and keep them clear.

If you are starting out with particularly dirty boards or a large number of boards, you might want to use the Mr. Clean pads or the other 3M pads for a good initial cleaning, and throw them away after they fall apart.

One of my boards has rough edges, and little bits (breadcrumb size) from the edges of the eraser have fallen off.

We have several cheap white boards kicking around our house that don't come clean no matter how hard we try.
