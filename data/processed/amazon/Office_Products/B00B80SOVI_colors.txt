So some printed colors like on my Crayola crayons would be a nice upgrade for the company to implement in the future.Bottom-line: Great pens; would be nice if they had printed color labels on the pen barrel; some assembly required to recreate the pretty display; the stand isn't made to endure harsh treatment from clumsy hands.NOTE: This review is based on a free Advance Review Copy of this product provided through Amazon Vine.~ Ana Mardoll The colors are many and varied, and will cover just about any possible need the junior artist may have. I've used up several of my favorite colors. The colors are beautiful. Some are standard colors, while some are a little out of the ordinary.There are neon colors, glitter, pastel, metallic, as well as regular pens. Some of the colors appear to be in multiples.The pens are stored on a lazy-susan, which would be nice to set up on art tables for people or kids to share.They are acid-free, non-toxic, and water-resistant, which makes them nice for scrapbooking and such.Forty dollars is a commitment to spend on gel pens, but they have their uses. Even though the colors are repeated, having this many pens is impressive and this is especially good for a gift or a setting where there are multiple users.This isn't five stars because many of the colors are repeats and there seems to be a lack of reds and oranges. I do think some colors got short changed, see below. Not having the colors numbered (especially when there are so many of similar colors) means that if you're trying to match a color to one you used previously (in a scrapbook, for example), you just have to guess. I recommend.Also, if you are expecting 100 different colors of pen...no. Most colors have three; I'm guessing the lone extra is a black one. Bright rich colors, flow easily from pens. The colors are bright, rich, beautiful -- the quality of ink is exceptional. The colors you do get are pretty, and the glitter and metallics look really nice, but I just can't go above 3 stars due to so many duplicate pens. The colors are rich.The stand is like a "Lazy Susan" and works well, though mine is a bit wobbly.
