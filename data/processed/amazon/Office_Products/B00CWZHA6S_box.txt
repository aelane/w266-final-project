This is probably the nicest moving box I have ever seen. The actual box is descent and arrives flat, so you'll have to fold them into shape. Not much to say except that this box is constructed well, and held up well in a move of some old books to storage.~ae~ A box this size can be a bit awkward to lift without something to grip onto. This is a nicely sized box, ideal for storage or moving. It is a basic box with no handles but is serviceable and of nice quality. Who doesn't have a taped up box in their garage that you wonder what's in it?? It's a box. A box is a box and when you've moved 7 times in 13 years like I have, it's a good idea to keep spare boxes around for when it's time to bug out. The box is big enough that if you were to put books or dishes into it, it would end up pretty heavy, and I don't know that the cardboard is substantial enough for heavy loads. The box is sturdy however it does not have interlocking tabs which means you'll need to have packing tape on hand to seal the box on the top and the bottom. The box is large so you'll want to put mostly lightweight things into it. (I did not, however, expect to only receive one box from the program.) It is a medium-duty box, so you would not want to pack anything too heavy in it, such as car batteries or hard-cover books, even tho the size is appropriate for both of those items. This moving box comes in packages of 20. The box is sturdy enough to comfortably fill with light and medium-weight items. However, the box will not work for books, nor will it work for heavy kitchen appliances (think mixer stands and things with heavy bases) or pots and pans. The box held up for two moves and looks like it can handle a couple more, so the durability is there. This helps you keep the box open when putting contents in there the first time. This box is pretty ordinary. It is not as big as the box in the picture, unless that woman is 3 feet tall. Initially I thought, 'who would buy a box?" All in all, a solid, easy to use, re-usable box! The box is sturdy, but probably wouldn't be used for multiple moves. Each one costs a little over $2.50 a box. I received this box to review as part of the vine program. The box was shipped inside another box, it is very sturdy and built well. It's just a box... right?From past experience, we often make mistakes with moving boxes. The box in the picture is at least 24 inches tall, and maybe 30 inches. If you filled this box with tools (like the product page above suggests) you would need two men to lift it, it would be that heavy.if you packed books, as suggested, it would be horribly heavy! What are they thinking?Realistically this would be a great box for packing clothes or blankets. I loaded up the box with books and could fit plenty inside. The box measures 18 1/8 x 18 x 16 although it looks much larger in the photo on the product page. She could probably fit inside the box. But otherwise it's just a box, nothing really fancy about it, perfect for moving and can probably stand up to a few moves if you don't abuse it too much. Great box for moving or storing stuff in the garage. I also have to say will also be a great box for shipping heavy items, because this box does not tear easily . This box sets up immediately and folds completely flat. than this is NOT the box for that! A box is a box is a box --  however when packing not all boxes are equal.This is a great box for bedding or medium weight items (like bulky kitchen items)Due to it's size not ideal for books or very heavy items. )This is a basic moving box with medium strength and medium thickness. Otherwise, it is a good box at a competitive price.If you look at the picture (at the time this review was posted) with the superstrong lady, that is not how this box looks like. The box is inadequate for books, furnishings or even heavy clothing. You need to tape the box for structural integrity.The box from Amazon that this box came in was a far more substantial container that this one. You want the box to be solid so it doesn't get stuff in it during the move. This is basically a moving box with a moving label already printed on the box. I received this moving box, enclosed within another box for shipping. This is a good box. The box is sturdy and it's a good size for what I needed it for. This box is a good size for carrying, especially if it is filled with light to medium weight items. Easy enough to reuse the box with new labels on top of the old ones!It used to be easy to get clean cardboard boxes from a grocery or drug store, but now they keep them for recycling and the option would be to go to one of the large cross country truck rental places to buy boxes. The box is really not strong enough to be filled with books.T
