This was the most difficult printer to setup of any printer hardware in my more than twenty years of computing. The printer can work on Windows XP and higher, and even on Android. The printer in the box comes with A/C Plug-in, D/C converter, Standard USB cable to connect from printer to computer, and a modest amount of labeling tape to get you started.Epson also gave me, for testing, samples of some other tape types that can be ordered. I highly recommend this Epson Label Works portable printer. Also comes with traditional USB printer cable. This Epson LabelWorks portable printer is a very clever and effective device for a reasonable price.The device can be installed easily from your Android or iOS devices (iPhone. This great little printer is the swiss army knife of label printers. The Mac required me to connect the printer via USB and install the appropriate driver from Epson's site. While there is much to like in the Epson LabelWorks LW-600P, there are also some drawbacks.The printer needs a driver--even for Macintosh computers. Just open the printer door, and stick it in where it fits, making sure that the end of the tape fits through the ejection slot. The included printer wire is not not needed if you connect via Bluetooth. I have another Epson printer that has it's own small keyboard but the ability to use the IPad especially makes that one obsolete. You can allow the printer to automatically detect the label length or you can manually set it to what you want. I've used several of them and they've all been great.I absolutely love this printer. This little printer can do an incredible amount of stuff. This printer offers a lot of great features, perfect for printing from your smartphone. This printer has a tiny footprint and I have connected it to my pc and iPad, so it is always available for a quick organizing job.
