The paper accepts and absorbs the ink without seeping through or veining in the paper fibers. The paper color is not bright white, but is appropriate for a greeting card.The package insert, dated 2007, states that Avery DesignPro software is Windows only. I'd suggest trying this once or twice with plain paper, so you know exactly how to flip the paper for your particular printer.To me, these products fall in the etiquette scale between  a hand-written note on your personal letterhead and a greeting card you bought in the grocery store. The paper looks much better right out of the box, works great in the printer, does not smear and most important gives you a photo-like image on the paper.They are a nice big size and come with their own envelopes (which is good since they are so big). I usually use Hallmark's greeting card paper and like it a lot. The paper accepts all the colored inks well, with the printing and pictures clear and clean-looking. I then printed a saying on regular paper and glued it to the back of the card. The paper fed through my printer with ease each time (not too thick), and it worked well for double sided printing with no bleed through. The paper is sturdier and nicer looking than normal printer paper. The paper quality is good, and there is a wide variety of templates to choose from on the Avery web site. Unfortunately, I realized greeting card paper was a bit costly when not on clearance, so I turned to other paper for my cards. Hold the paper up to a lamp to find the brightest white side for the photo.) (All glossy paper I have ever seen has the brand's name on the back, so messages can't be printed there.)
