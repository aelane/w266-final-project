The keyboard tray's sliding track is 17.75" long and 6.0" wide, and it uses six 0.75"-long screws being screwed around its perimeter to mount it to the underside of your desk.If the underside of your desk is metal, or has obstructions, wood beams, or metal support bars crossing its underside (e.g. Before you buy this keyboard tray, sit at your desk where you would be mounting the keyboard tray, take a ruler and measure 4 inches from the bottom surface of the desk. I may later want to transfer this keyboard tray to another desk, so to preserve this template sheet better, I also stuck clear cellophane tape over the hole markers on the template sheet before I drilled through the sheet so that the drill made two holes that were neat and free from tears in the template sheet.The keyboard tray comes with a variety of adhesive-backed Velcro-type fasteners  that are used to attach the keyboard wrist rest to the tray, attach the mouse wrist rest to the mouse platform, and affix the keyboard to the tray so that the keyboard also remains stationary on the tray. You should adjust the keyboard tray so that your wrists are pivoted slightly downward while you type, and your elbows and forearms should neither be raised too high nor lowered too low. As previously mentioned, to optimally use this keyboard tray, you really need to sit in an ergonomic chair that allows you adjust the chair's height/depth/angle and the chair's armrests should also be height-adjustable.If you have the keyboard tray pivoted and tilted more steeply, you increase the chance of having your mouse slide off the mouse pad and keyboard tray and onto the floor. If you use an ergonomic keyboard with a curved contour on this keyboard tray, you can purchase aMMMWR314MB - Curved Ergonomic Keyboard Gel Wrist Restto fit your keyboard instead of using the supplied straight-shaped wrist pad.During use, this keyboard tray has a very admirable rigidity. Most sliding keyboard trays that are built into office desks have far more bounce to them.&#9658; Purchasing Considerations & Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:If you are deciding between the "Knob Adjust", "Lever Adjust", and "Easy Adjust" options that 3M offers, consider that 3M prices their "Knob Adjust" models as the less expensive option, their "Lever Adjust" models cost more by a slight price increase, and the "Easy Adjust" models increase the price another notch. What I think this keyboard tray would be best for is in an office setting where the keyboard is mounted to one of those heavy-duty office desks like they made before computers were even invented. This keyboard tray is very solidly constructed, heavy, but a bit awkward to use. This 3M Keyboard Tray with Lever Adjust Arm is far heavier than other keyboard trays I have been experienced before (in home and in office). I am therefore set up with my keyboard on a heavy black wooden tray, mouse on the mousepad at my right, wrist resting nicely on the wrist pad. The keyboard tray arrived at my house in a very large box, weighing nearly 20 lbs.
