There is a pocket on that where one can store a cell phone, but I put a snack bar there. There is a full sized zippered pocket, too.All in all, this is a useful product, though I would not want to carry it around. I like the pocket on the inside left side of the binder where I can put my spare coupons. It would be nice if there was another pocket in the inside right side of the binder for extra storage. Additionally, there is a large zippered pocket that could be used for pencils and things, or a tablet. There is another pocket for a phone.The binder is roomy and made of material that could withstand the elements. There is one pocket, with a zipper flap over it, which can work for storing a calculator (make sure it's not too wide though).There's no compartment for storing pencils, pens, erasers, etc. Large pocket to &#34;shove it all&#34; into (you know when you just need to shovesomething fast but securely.And the large ring holders in the back.You can put this into a backpack. The other pocket has a Velcro tabbed enclosure that is 3.125 inches wide, and can hold items up to about 8.25 inches long. But it is a mesh, see-through pocket that will hold plenty of school supplies. There's also a velcro-tabbed pocket that would hold a smart phone or calculator.The 2" rings are round and have a capacity of 880 sheets. It would be nice if it had a zippered pocket on the outside for quick access to a needed pen, pencil or eraser, and that's really its only flaw. There is no interior pocket on the inside of the back cover in case you are used to having that from a 2 inch capacity standard binder.Priced below $20, this product is very comparable to similar products I have seen in my local office supply at closer to $30. If this pocket had a place for pens & pencils, flash drives, and various other small, school related items, it would be a darn near perfect product.My Swiss-gear backpack utilizes a similar sized space with a much more organized set of available pockets, pen holders and even little compartments with Velcro closure for flash drives.
