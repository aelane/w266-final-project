What a useful product. A very useful product. Overall, however, an excellent product that I will purchase. This is an excellent product to keep handy. I picked this product to review because I recently purchased a 2010 planner that does not have dividers for each month. This is an overall great product as several other reviewers have stated. I really love this product and intend to stock up on them before next quarter.There are a variety of uses for this product. Great product! Great product! What more can be said, a great product for your office or school needs. Thoughtful product!Is this review helpful?

I was surprised at how small they were....I read the product dimensions before ordering, but they upon receipt, it is evident that there is not much room to write on the small half circle crescent at the top of the tab.
