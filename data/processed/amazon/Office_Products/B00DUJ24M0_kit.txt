If you like to be super organized this kit is for you. If not, this kit can provide clarity. I recommend this kit for anyone who loves Post-it notes. This kit is great in theory. When I saw this organizer kit, I knew I had to have it. The kit also contains lined, Post-It sized pads that are sticky over the entire back. Though the kit seems geared for students, it will increase efficiency for anyone. Thankfully, this kit also comes with a blank version of the pre-labeled tabs, which I mostly use to mark the end of my textbook reading assignments.One star deduction because this package is far less impressive than the image makes it out to be; the box itself is just a regular cardboard box (not something you'd necessarily tote around in your bag but I suppose you could). This kit has virtually all one would want. I wish I'd had a full, organized kit like this years ago! This kit allows you (or whoever you give it to) to sample different kinds of Post-Its and decide what you like best.I use Post-Its all the time- at work, at home, on the go- and this kit is definitely useful and well worth the price! This is a TINY kit of Post-It items, not individually wrapped or packaged. If they wanted it to be a true "kit", it should have come in a tin (my choice), or a plastic container, or an attractively designed cardboard box, or anything else, really!I am not sure how many sheets/pads are included in each item, but it seems like plenty to get you through the year.What it does NOT include, but that I use all the time and need, and I added to the kit:~ 2" x 2" note pad~ 1 15/16" x 9/16" note padsSo, bottom line: good value for the price, but kit could use some additions/improvements. This kit has everything! This is a perfect starter kit for school. But this kit doesn't wow me; it seems duplicative and redundant. This kit includes a variety of items especially designed for those who think it's a mortal sin to write in books--flags, arrows, note tabs, and something I've long wished existed, full-adhesive notes. With this very comprehensive kit, I'm able to mark pages in my books without having to dog-ear or highlight them, which means I can sell my books back at the end of the semester. I'm really pretty thankful for this little kit. The kit overall can be very helpful. I wish a little more came in the kit though. This kit contains full size packs of front and side-oriented Note Tabs (my faves), multi-colored arrow flags, regular flags, labels, and tabs, full adhesive notes (also awesome), and a highlighter/tab dispenser combo pen.You can't go wrong with this set. What a great kit for back-to-school or for a disorganized mom (me)! I really like this kit and now am in the process of trying to take SOME of the pieces back from the teen! I used this little study kit for a 200 hour education program I went through in September, it was perfect and had plenty of supplies left over for another educational program. This kit will help anyone find, remind, and remember everything. This handy, colorful kit will more easily organize any busy life. This kit is perfect for the student heading back to school. This is a great little kit but the price is outrageous. I was very surprised to find out it was the Vine post-it kit. This kit is AMAZING! This kit came with Post-it flags, tabs, note tabs and Grid notes and more. What's not to love about this little kit of Post-Its? This little kit is darling and contains a little bit of everything.
