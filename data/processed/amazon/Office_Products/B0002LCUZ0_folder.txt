Each folder contains 6 prong style fasteners should you wish to secure documents to the folder. Inside each folder are prongs to hold your papers in the front and in back of the folder as well as dividers that have prongs as well. When a regular folder won't do but a binder is just a bit too much the Smead Classification Partition folder is a great option. Who said a folder is a folder? If you think you may end up using more than one folder for a particular subject/topic, you may be better off purchasing an individual ring binder that would allow as many individual dividers as you wanted to be imported into the folder and would do it in a "cleaner" way.2. ... an expandable folder file to really stick it the hundreds of useless government type form letters, fraudulent hospital bills...., a denial of military medical records form letter (I'm "too stupid" apparently to understand basis medical diagnosis - I'm not). So I know to grab the yellow folder when hunting for health care & show the pharmacist the blue folderThe Tyvex reinforced spine along with the sturdy pressboard construction ... The folder has a metal paper fastener inserted through perforations on both front and back, about a half-inch down from the top. This inner folder, which functions as a pair of dividers, also has a metal fastener attached to the top of both sides of each divider, for a total of six fasteners. The folder is made of hard paper which is recyclable as advertised. Would recommend this folder to my friends.
