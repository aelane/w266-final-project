These labels were exactly what I needed. These labels live up to the great quality I have come to expect from their company. I think these labels are terrific. The other is to produce labels in-house that requires downloading a wizard or blank templates or pre-designed ones for Microsoft Word, Adobe software, or Apple Pages. These labels would be AWESOME if the template worked properly. These labels come 12 to a sheet - 3 wide by 4 labels tall. I used these labels with our newest printer, theEpson WorkForce 545 Color Inkjet Wireless All-In-One Printer and Copier with Fax (C11CB88201)for superb results.If you are considering ordering these labels you can use the Avery website to experiment with creating your label and print it on standard paper to get an idea how they will appear before purchasing this product. The labels are very nice. But as I stated the labels are very nice and would add a nice touch to my package. I got these labels because they were the perfect size and shape to use on my book club paraphenilia (Water bottles, notebooks, etc.) The labels have a nice feel to them...they're not flimsy and so far I haven't had them smear on me. These labels are fabulous to label canning jars. These labels arrived today and I couldn't wait to play with them. I had beautiful labels made in just minutes. I like these labels. They also make nice labels for homemade food gifts as they inform and jazz up jams, pies, cookies, etc. I've been using the Avery 5293 labels for about 4 years. These labels, just like the 5293, are not water-resistant (well, what I mean is they will break down if exposed to moisture or humidity). I use round labels a lot for canning, and usually what I do is print on good paper, use a 2 inch round circle punch, and either use spray adhesive or packing tape to put the label on my lids.So I was happy to try these out.Pros:Gorgeous white glossy finishNice smooth edgesEasy to pull off one at a timeInk doesn't smudge on the glossy finish when it's allowed to dry.Good adhesive.Symmetrical borders for less fussy printingCons:I really wish there were more than one template option from the site.They have a lot of crafty possibilities if there was a simple PNG template available. I enjoy creating my own labels for things like my children's birthday parties, stickers for gift boxes, and labels for our small business, so I was excited to try these Avery labels when they were offered on Vine.Things I liked about the labels:Customizable templates offered on the avery.com websiteEasy to peel from the sheetAn 800 # if you need help and want to talk to someone "live"Quality paper used for the construction of the label2 inch size is perfect for any use and has a lot of space for combined text and graphicBox tops for education label on each packageRecyclable box--good for the environment100% satisfaction guarantee--so if you try them and don't like them, you are not out any money for the purchaseThings I wish were better about the labels:The labels are difficult to design--I do use a MAC (with Microsoft Office software), so that may have an impact on why it was so tough for me to design the labels, but it seemed I could not move a picture to where I wanted it in the box. REVIEW EDITED AND UPDATED AFTER FURTHER USE.These labels would be perfect for crafts or small business labeling if the templates were even partially acceptable. The labels seem to be pretty durable and attach securely and easily to whatever surface you choose. They aren't repositional like other labels, but it doesn't matter since the lids are disposed of anyways.A nice product and perfect for what we need it for. Round labels, however, are not like that. There's not really much you can say about labels. These labels are of good quality, with the right amount of gloss, to produce labels with a professional appearance. Nothing about these labels will have a homemade look, unless of course you want it that way.
