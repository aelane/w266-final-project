As I was hoping, this is a classic Swingline stapler. Ok stapler. I have rarely ever seen a stapler without the Swingline logo on it. This stapler lives up to its brand name. It's been my go-to stapler for a very long time and I'm sure I could use it to drive nails if I had to but I don't. This stapler will not replace my old stapler. That said, this is a very well constructed stapler. I suspect this stapler is better than the modern 747s but that would just be a guess.I hope this helps everyone. It indicates that it is a good stapler. What more can you ask of a stapler? This is a decent stapler. It's hard to know how to buy a good old fashioned, durable stapler any more.Well, here it is. This stapler looks professional, is heavy-duty enough to staple most things reliably, rarely jams, and will last a lifetime. This stapler handles all of my stapling needs, as I use mini or larger binder clips for anything too big for this beauty to handle. You can't go wrong with this stapler. The stapler is easy to load and has yet to jam or malfunction. Bought this stapler at a local office supply store and love it! This stapler is just perfect for a large or small office. And I have found that I use this as my dependable, everyday stapler. It staples like a stapler should. It makes a great stapler for an office. This is the stapler that we always found on the teacher's desk or in the office. It's a classic commercial stapler with no frills and ready for lots of stapling and the occasional drop or spill.Durable with a large staple capacity (a full row of the Swingline staples) this is as no-frills as you can get for a stapler. This stapler is being used in a restaurant, where every credit card receipt gets stapled to the guest cheque. Thus far, this stapler has been good to us. This seems like a perfectly nice stapler. I like this stapler, but yesterday, it got jammed very badly, and I wasted time fixing it. Since this never happened to my previous stapler, I am hoping this was a crazy fluke that will not re-occur. I can't really complain about this stapler. This is the standard issued stapler for the Seattle Public Schools before 1998. I have previously purchased an inexpensive stapler, it was also a Swingline. This stapler works great, all metal construction, and as it is pretty long it is easy to staple through a pretty large stack of paper without any problem. This Swingline stapler was once the king of all staplers. The new Commercial stapler from today's Acco/Swingline is, like most manufactured products, built in China to a price and in my view does not deserve the name Commercial. The old stapler has a substantial and attractively art deco styled cast base while the new one makes due with a quickly stamped steel cheaper alternative. The old stapler has a much easier way to switch modes between inward bending and outward bending rear legs. For an inexpensive stapler it works pretty well.Loads easily with regular staples, and I've tested it with items as thick as the cardboard on the back of a writing pad. A stapler needs to stay put, and the bottom slide around a lot. My old stapler kept jamming and I finally gave up it and needed a new one. If you need an everyday stapler that can handle just 2 sheets or 15, then this is your deal. I love this new stapler! I needed a stapler that I could also use for a 'tacker', without paying a too high price and because I don't have a car, it is a problem trying to shop when others bring me as I like to check out prices, etc. Excellent and sturdy stapler at an excellent price! This stapler has had heavy use in  a very busy office and it can easily staple 28 pages of 20 pound paper, 20 pages of 24 pound paper.The heavy size adds balance and gives the user confidence. This is a great stapler that is built well and will probably be on my desk for the next 30 years until I retire! This is an excellent stapler. I was given my first Swingline stapler as a gift in 1974 when I was in my early 20's and getting myself set up as a writer. But I needed a new stapler for my classroom, so of course I chose a Swingline product. This is a great stapler and indeed heavy duty! This is the stapler all my teachers had in school. It is the stapler which will move with you wherever you go.One thing I've discovered about staplers is the quality of staples is as important as the quality of the stapler, so if you are having any problem with this or any other stapler, try out a box of top quality staples and see if that doesn't make a difference. Swingline manufactures an easy to use solid stapler. The stapler has a hinge release that allows you to stable things to walls or other flat surfaces. I anticipate this stapler lasting for well over 20 years. The stapler doesn't jam, heavy, and durable. This stapler, from the minute I took it out of the box, felt different. This particular stapler is made of metal, holds a full strip of staples, and will staple 20 sheets of paper well. This a full-sized stapler and has some heft to it which I am sure is due to its solid metal construction. The stapler is also designed to open up so you can staple without using the base (for example when stapling a paper to a bulletin board). The stapler will then open up flat. Classic, durable stapler. This is simply a perfect stapler, I cannot think of anything to improve. Just used this stapler to staple 135 sets of 13 page documents. This is a solid stapler. we're all guilty of misusing a stapler for killing spiders, weighing down loose papers on a desk, even throwing it at useless co-workers which is definitely NOT what the manufacturer had in mind when they made the Swingline Black 44401, but i can assure the reader that it outperforms all other staplers when used in these ways and as a projectile.

I highly recommend this stapler by Swingline for your home office and general purpose needs.

I know that I will have a stapler that lasts FOREVER.

This Swingline stapler is, I'm afraid, not one of the better ones on the market.
