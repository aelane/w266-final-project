I have too many printers set up at my house right now. I was surprised at how small it was compared to previous printers but it does not skip out on any functions. I have had other Epson printers and I am not as fond of this one as I am other higher end products of the same line. I have two printers...this and the WF 3520 which is about double the price of the XP 400, and I love them both but the WF3520 has a fax. Having had several printers in my home over the past few years I can tell you truthfully that I still don't know a whole lot about them. I've had many printers and used to try and buy the cheapest options, but I am completely happy with Epson's current line of printers, they just need to make one that has wireless scanning (if you want to scan to your computer you have to attached a USB cable).Highly recommended. I especially like printers that load in the back and not by a tray. Not as sharp as you would good from other high-end larger printers but the results were good enough to satisfy my needs. I have owned several Epson printers and all-in-the ones over the years. I have used many printers in the past and I used to be a pro-Canon person. Black and white takes as it should for any ink-jet printers. I didn't really notice that this was much smaller than other printers I've used. (I've been used to printers that just assume a multipage document needs to be printed so that the last page comes out first and the first page is on the top of the stack of printed pages. Much, much faster now - comparable to most of the other printers I've had. Normally my printers get much more use than I have put on this one. Compared with other printers, it was really easy to connect my wireless internet: you just enter the password on the LED screen and everything is good to go. After my last two printers, I changed my mind about WiFi being a useless feature, but actually being a very important one. This printers output is nice (not fabulous though), but it eats ink like it's going out of style. So do you want to pay now or pay later?Lastly, I've had Epson printers destroy themselves over a paper jam--literally stripped its gears. Owned many printers of other makers, but never an Epson.

About average with most printers in this price range.One great thing about this printer is that you can print directly from your ipad (I tested this out from my iPad2) without having to connect to your computer, sync and then print from your computer.The one slight worry I have about this is that cartridges that come with the printer don't appear to be very large (it takes 4 seperate cartridges, black, cyan, magenta and yello) and therefore I can see you having to buy new cartridges sooner than some other printers, however with good refill products available right here on amazon (via third party companies) this won't be too much of a problem (ECOOLMART is a good one that I would recommend - http://www.amazon.com/gp/aag/main?ie=UTF8&asin;=&isAmazonFulfilled;=1&isCBA;=&marketplaceID;=ATVPDKIKX0DER&seller;=A2P5QXBDU51LJA).The scanner allowes you to scan images upto 2400dpi (more than you need for most things) and scans documents and photographs in about the same time as most other scanners.Overall, you get a lot of features for a printer in this price range, its very easy to setup and works very well.Recommended if you are looking for a cheap and flexible all-in-one.

I've had two other Epson printers with varying degrees of success, but so far my favorite is the Epson WorkForce 545.

I have had many Epson printers and currently use the Workforce 645 which is also excellent.
