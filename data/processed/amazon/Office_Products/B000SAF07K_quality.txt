I was surprised by the quality of the card stock. I guess I'm use to a higher quality file folder because when I touched it I immediately noticed that it didn't feel as smooth as what I have bought in the past. Good quality, sides are cut smoothly, no tear or uneven edges. They are good quality folders. Pendaflex is a great quality brand that I have used regularly at work. We found these of very good quality and at a decent (though not super-bargain) price. The quality is good enough and the price was right. Decent quality, great price compared to what local stores in the area charge, so I'm a happy camper! Good quality product and brand. Excellent quality folders and fits nicely in file cabinet if you like to organize your life properly so you can find things at a seconds notice. These are high quality as far as file folders go.
