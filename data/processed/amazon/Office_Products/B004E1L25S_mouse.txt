The mouse portion of the tray is independently adjustable and I have it set higher and flatter than the keyboard portion. Just make the mouse a bit more sensitive and you'll be fine.The tray holds straight bottom keyboards very tightly. I like how it was designed, how I can put the mouse tray in either the left or right position, and it's great to be able to angle the trays to my needs. The mouse and keyboard wrist pads are comfortably soft, firm, and warm (well, more like they don't get cold).The mounting instructions are visual and not hard to understand...well, except for Step #2 which took me about 5 minutes of staring at it before I realized what it was trying to tell me. The mouse tray can be mounted on either side of the keyboard, which was helpful for me as a left-handed person.The only potential caveat for prospective buyers is that it's heavy- not excessively heavy or anything, but it's a solid unit, so buyers need to know that the mounting job needs to be good, or it might pull away from the mounting surface over time. By adjusting the mouse tray, I can do my research for longer stretches of time and never get distracted by wrist pain. The mouse tray screws in on either side. Second, the mouse cord has a tendency to hang up in the gap between the keyboard and mouse trays.

The mouse pad can be installed on each side, adjusted up and down, tilted forward or backward, and slid left or right to any position comfortable to the user.

The mouse tray itself can swing up, fold out, and slide in and out.

The mouse pad can be mounted on either side, adjusted from side to side, and to different heights relative to the keyboard.
