I have been waiting for a product like these for years. I really love this product because when I carry normal post its around they get bent and fall off the pack. Another great Post-It product. just when you think Post its couldn't get any better, they come out with this product. They are really a nice product. Great product. Its amazing how aq product this simple is still evolving. A great product! Kudos for improving a helpful product! And this product shows that very well.These full adhesive notes are a variation of the post-its that we're accustomed to. But it does seem like a better product ... not just a twist, an alternative to the thin-strip of adhesive we're used to, but an overall improvement on the Post-It Note.

Now, 3M has improved the product one more time and, in my opinion, it can't possibly get any better.

3M has improved a superior product - if it were possible to award more than 5 stars, I would do so.

All in all, a handy new product.
