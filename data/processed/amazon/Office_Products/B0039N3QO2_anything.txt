Just like anything sticky, it is going to adhere to paper more permanently although you can wash the paper off and reuse the tab. These won't handle anything with any backing or frame.I've used both these and similar products like poster putty on painted walls and found these to be much better - it doesn't damage the paint, and it comes off of posters easily too. This works pretty well, as long as you do not try to hang anything too heavy (ie, heavier than a laminated piece of paper). - anything that may remind you of important events and dates. Usually, anything with adhesive will be a "use once" application on regular paper, but these tabs actually do peel cleanly off the paper and are ready for the next use. I have yet to get anything to stick to my walls for more than a day. And I'd certainly never try to hang anything of weight on tabs that had previously been used. Be sure to test before trying to hang anything precious or if you are trying to adhere to a more porous surface. I never expected anything, but after washing it off it still has a lot of stick left to it! I wouldn't want to use them on anything particularly heavy, but they'll definitely hold something light. I'm glad I didn't test these on anything valuable!Basically, the longer the papers had the tabs on the back, the harder it was to remove without total destruction of the paper! We haven't tried them on anything heavy yet, just mostly artwork and posters, but I don't see any problems with these being able to hold up something like a calendar.
