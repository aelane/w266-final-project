These are very nice labels for making Q R Bar codes. I use these to make labels for my jar candles. These labels were exactly what I needed. So these are great labels. Microsoft Word hasn't been updated yet to include these labels in their "labels" section, so all you need to do is go to avery.com/print and type in the number on the package, and begin to create. I used these to make labels for gift boxes that I made for my friends for the holiday season. I would recommend these labels for oversize envelopes and sealing packages as well as labelling items in the home or office. If you want smaller labels, you can cut them as needed, which will also dramatically increase the amount of labels that you have.Avery labels are definitely great products, and while they are a little expensive ($14 at the time I write this review), they are durable and useful in so many ways. These labels are intended to dress up packaging, mainly QR codes. I've been cutting regular labels square to fit my product, so for me this was a prefect solution.Not only are these an awesome shape, but the quality is definitely better than, say, a normal office address label. These little labels were the perfect size for printing my at home business logo on. The labels are sharp-cornered squares, with just over a quarter inch of whitespace between each label for overprint.Listed on the package is an address where to find the download for the template (22806) for use in Microsoft Word. I chose to give these labels a try because I thought they would make nice adhesive gift tags. These labels are capable of being printed all the way to the edge, but I didn't try out any designs using that. Love this labels. So far, I've used these labels to customized things for my book club (Books, notepads, and key chains). These labels are fabulous for label canning jars. These square labels are one of my favorite Avery products. They are perfect for printing labels for gift bags/boxes, branding packages or brochures or labeling containers to keep organized. These are awesome labels for all your marketing and promotional needs. These labels are 2 by 2 inch square and just the right size for lots of uses. You can get cheaper labels, but you will not get the same quality. Very pleased with these labels. The labels have a fold-back crease for each row for easy peeling. I wanted to try these labels out because they weren't your 'normal' labels in the size range that they came in:  mailing, shipping, address, file folder, etc....  You can use them for many purposes:  packaging, letters, bags, gift-wrapping, etc.... I also like that Avery now makes their labels for both types of printers as I use laser and inkjet printers in my home and at work.I've always enjoyed reviewing labels made by Avery. I can't speak highly enough about Avery labels. I was so excited to try these square labels! These labels are very handy and work just fine. We have personalized these labels for homemade  gifts ! I've had other labels peel off way too easily, but these Avery ones really do stay put.These are great for business use or as gift tags. These Avery labels are exactly what a small business needs to compete with the big boys when it comes to packaging!They are 2" x 2", permanent, allow for edge-to-edge printing, are thick enough that nothing underneath the label shows through, and are easy to peel off. I use mine for printing pretty labels for home baked gifts. These square labels are a good size 2 x 2 and I even used them to print out mailing address for a small package or envelope. First, be sure you really want labels this small. But if you do need small labels, these are pretty good.Avery makes a template available for Word, and only Word. Avery labels are the standard. In the past, I have used the removable labels, which peel right off with no problem. Nonetheless, these labels look good, especially when printed at a 45-degree angel and used as a diamond-shaped label.
