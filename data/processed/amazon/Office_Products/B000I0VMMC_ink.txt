I have taken to just waiting for ink to dry period. and the ink is pretty much smear-proof except on cash register receipts (I tested them on several different kinds of paper). Maybe I waited too long, YMMV, but the ink did not smear at all.I was concerned when I got these about the highlighter drying out with no traditional cap on it to keep it moist. Plus the ink dries fast so it doesn't get all over your hands. As advertised the ink dries fast enough so it doesn't end up on skin or smudging across the page.This sounds crazy but I do some high volume highlighting in one of my jobs, and these highlighters are noticeably improved over generic alternatives. The ink is also non-smear, and I tried everything to test that claim, including rubbing butter and oil on the highlighted line in an attempt to recreate greasy fingers turning pages while studying.Those are the positives. Additionally, some of the ink colors are dark and the highlighted writing beneath them hard to read. But I was happy to find out that it can indeed highlight without blurring the ink. They don't pick up ink from the print and leave it on the tip so they stay clean. I didn't think it would be an issue.To see how much ink was in the pens, I colored in one side of a regular piece of paper. The ink is vibrant and comparative with other sharpie models complete with the angled tips. The ink is bright and applies easily, but the trade-off for these saturated colors is that there is noticeable bleed-through on thin paper such as typical bible pages. The ink seems to dry out fairly fast and, unless you highlight a whole paragraph (and lay out a lot of ink in a concentrated space) it doesn't curl the paper. The ink dries fast when applied and doesn't dry out when not in use because the barrel locks hermetically to avoid evaporation, so I expect them to be long-lasting, especially since there are no caps to lose.THE NOT SO GREATThere are 8 colors.

I need either a regular ink pen or a broad tipped marker.

The ink didn't smudge any of these prints.

I like how they are retractable and keep the ink moist and there is a satisfying "click" when you want to use them or are finished.
