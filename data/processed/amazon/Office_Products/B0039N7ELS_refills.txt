I think I will continue to buy the refills once this one runs out, works well enough that its the first thing I grab before messing around with glue. I appreciate that it is refillable and I intend to purchase additional refills as needed. Changing the refills is also very simple. You can buy refills for the applicator (which I already bought) that cost about $1 less than a full applicator. I have bought many refills and love it for my card making and paper crafting. It accepts refills instead of just being a disposable item.All in all a very neat way to glue; tidy, efficient, affordable and effective.~ Lee Mellott I haven't used it for very long so I don't know how long it will last before refills. If you could get refills in the $2 or $3 range, it would probably be a more economical way to do crafts. I'll still be using it for myself, but I don't think I'll be buying refills for it... even when I used it I had trouble getting all the glue on the paper, which means stuff doesn't stick as well as it should!

I will be buying refills for it when it runs out.

Refilling seems to be pretty easy, and the refills are competitively priced.I will no longer be using tape to seal gift-wrap, and I'm suggesting a couple of these for my office, so that we can get away from tape and glue as much as possible.

I already ordered the refills.
