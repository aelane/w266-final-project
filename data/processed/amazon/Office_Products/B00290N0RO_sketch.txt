This sketch book is just the right size for the artist on the go. The Academie 14 x 11 sketch book is great for doing larger works. It definitely is not a lap sketch book though. This is a nice big sketch book. I like having this big sketch book where I can practice different techniques all on one page to be able to easily look and compare different attempts that I make. My pre-teen carries a sketch book everywhere. This is a nice large sketch pad with very good quality paper. I love my new Mead sketch book! I've tried many different sketch pads and this is one of my favorites now. This is a really nice sketch pad, but I hope you have a big desk! Wonderful sketch book. But if you expect a clean, perfect sketch, you're not going to get it unless you trace your finished drawing onto a clean sheet of paper.I'll give this sketchpad 4 stars, because it has a lot of great features. I've put this sketch book through a lot of tests. Surprisingly large sketch book of 70 sheets of paper. This sketch diary is perfect for pencil, pen, and most dry media. It is hard to find a sketch pad this size that is spiral bound, allowing you to lay pages flat. Overall great sketch book for art projects. This sketch pad is perfect for my 4-year-old granddaughter, who loves drawing, coloring, collecting stickers, and using rubber stamps. The sketch book provides a place for her to centralize everything, so that it isn't scattered all over.
