The Scotch-brand laminator is, by far, the most inexpensive, and it is quite usable for home applications as long as you do not need a laminator that quickly warms up and has a quicker laminating speed. And Black&Decker;'s fastest laminator, the LAM125FH, is 11.7 pounds, 1750 watts, with a warm-up time of 60 seconds and a laminating speed of 48&#34;/minute. All three of these Black&Decker; laminator models accept a laminating pouch as wide as 9.5&#34;, which is a very common maximum pouch size for most laminators.I am thoroughly pleased with how easy and trouble-free this laminator has been during the past two months of usage, and how nice the results are. This laminator lives up to its &#34;Flash&#34; and &#34;Fast Heat&#34; names. Here is how you can use this laminator to preserve beautiful autumn foliage:1) First, as soon as you collect the leaves during autumn, press and dry them. Once I have slid the laminating pouch into the laminator's slot, the rollers will start pulling the pouch in after about one-third of the pouch has been carefully pushed into the slot. This laminator has a handy output feed tray that swings out and keeps the laminated sheet more level as it is rolled out from the laminator. The laminator beeps once to indicate that it is shutting off.I have one problem with this machine - the corner punch is hit or miss. This is my 3rd laminator, and probably the 5th that I have used. This laminator is a great way to save precious documents and photos and also create projects that kids can write on with dry erase markers. Overall this Black and Decker laminator is an excellent product that is hampered only by its price. This laminator works just fine. The Black & Decker Fast Heat Laminator is an impressive looking laminator designed to be "ready to use in just 60 seconds" according to the manufacturer's product page. The laminator can do cold lamination, 3 mil, and 5 mil thickness sheets. The Black and Decker laminator is ready quickly, a tremendous bonus in a home or school situation where you just need to laminate 1 item. The laminator also feeds faster than my Fellowes laminator, reducing the chances of binding or curling endemic to slower feed mechanisms. This is a really great laminator, but it does suffer from a couple of issues that bother me at the price this if offered.I'll give the weaknesses first because they are really minor. If I were to leave this laminator out at all times, I'd likely use the little drawer for storing something small that would't be bothered by the heat instead of its intended use. The laminator only comes with a sample of each, so additional pouches will need to be purchased. This Black & Decker laminator is exceptional!They did their homework on this one, and it's packed with problem solving features.We have two other very nice, brand name laminators, but for all-around conveniencespeed and cleverly thought-out design of features ~ this one leaves them in the dust.Our other equipment does a quality job of laminating and I've been very happy with it.It didn't bother me that they run a little slower, and I've learned to manage a few inconveniences ~never dreaming there was a different laminator that solved all the issues ~ and more.1. This laminator uses both hot and cold pouches (cold laminating, 3 mil and 5 mil pouches).
