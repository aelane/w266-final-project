However if your printer is in another room from say your desktop that is not feasible. I decided to first set up my printer wirelessly with my Netgear router manually and then set up my laptop using the Brother software to find the MFP on the network and to get necessary drivers. This has been an easy-to-set-up and easy-to-use printer & scanner. My other Brother printer does allow b/w printing when the color cartridges are out, so I hope that is the case with this machine also.So far, I would recommend this machine for office or home use. Frankly, I was amazed at how easily this printer set up, the user-friendly operation and touchscreen, the clear instructions, just everything worked the way it was supposed to. They are usually my "go-to" printer, expecially when it comes to laser printers. I started out with my monochrome printer and worked my way up to purchasing twoBrother MFC-9970CDW Color Laser All-in-One with Wireless Networking and Duplexprinters. The printer itself tops 67lbs. I had a printer ruined by third party cartridges years ago and the savings just aren't worth it for me as I depend on my printing being reliable.We ended up with the MFC-L8850CDW connected via wired networking. To get that the printer has a large surge current needed to warm the print drum/fuser.

Then I went on my MacBook Pro, used the add printer option and the Brother popped up immediately.

I know, I know, just like the printer makers always warned you--and I was previously one to poo-poo those claims as money-grubbing and fear-mongering ...

It's all business.The MFC-L8850CDW is one HEAVY printer.
