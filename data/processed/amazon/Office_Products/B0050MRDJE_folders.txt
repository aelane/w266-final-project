I am really pleased with these folders. I received these folders yesterday in the afternoon and used two last night to carry manuscripts to a workshop. I received six folders in the package: two blue, two red, and two black making it easy to color code my files. The six folders in the pack come in three different colors - red, blue, and black. Furthermore, I wish the folders are made of heavier paper to make them a tad more sturdy and coated to make them water-resistant. These are nice folders except they are a bit expensive and except for the fold-over flap and disk cutout, they compare to the folders you will encounter in the stores for about a quarter or less. These Smead Lockit folders contain two pockets, a business card holder, cd rom holder, and a top flap to keep the papers inside. These folders are sturdily built and the cd pocket is much more convenient than I anticipated. I was really looking forward to using these folders since they have pockets for a variety of items, including discs. Unfortunately, the folders are very, very flimsy and not at all sturdy. These folders cannot withstand any slightly rougher than normal use or they going to tear and be less than usable.I can't recommend them. These folders are exactly what I need for giving information to clients at work. There folders are very nice. I have been using these folders around the home office, mostly as replacements for standard file folders. These Smead New Lockit Pocket folders are great. These are great durable functional folders that I can recommend. These folders are great if you don't have too much to put in them, and the things you're putting in aren't too important.The material is flimsy; it's not strong enough to offer very much protection. I have used similar folders to carry handouts for presentations or meetings as well as submitting portfolios or project reports. These folders are different in that they have a "flap" on the top that keeps sheets from falling off the folder. These folders have flaps at the top which prevent papers from falling out, which make them better than the standard ten cent folders you get at the drugstore. I really like these folders! They are also sturdier than the typical 5-for-a-dollar folders in the school supply section. I love that these folders have a cd holder in them, as well as a flap on top to hold papers in place. These folders work perfectly. These folders are well constructed I suspect they will hold up for some time. These folders feel as though they are of a heavier stock than most school or presentation folders. My first thought upon handling them was that they felt very much like the cheap folders purchased for school assignments.I'd personally prefer that the folders either be of a heavier stock or plasticized. These folders are nicely designed - they have pockets for papers, space for a business card, and space for a CD or DVD. It's not sturdier than other folders, and doesn't hold more papers, but has a slot for CDs. Just like those old folders you used to have as a kid, but even better. These are very sturdy/durable folders that can contain lots of papers. These are nice little folders for project proposals, not for every day filing where you need it to last a long time.
