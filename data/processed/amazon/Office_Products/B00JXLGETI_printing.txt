It also works on the original Ipad with iOS 5.Both printing and scanning are whisper quiet. I have an Artisan that does printing, but the CD part is often hidden and hard to find, and hard to work sometimes. I tried printing and scanning with this and it really very easy to use. Further, for cheap black and white printing, this Epson accepts an &#34;XL&#34; cartridge that prints up to 2200 pages (their claim), that for my printing needs, is great.Setup is incredibly easy:  just follow the few instructions; if you have a USB cable at the ready, it's a little bit easier, but if you don't, it looks like you can use the touch-screen to configure things - network printing/wireless printing/mobile printing. As far as mobile printing goes - I attempted to test it on my Samsung Galaxy player, but apparently it's not compatible with Espon's print software. The 13x19 printing is an interesting feature that, now that I have it, I can see myself using it more often, likely for making traceable outlines for stenciling, for example.As with previous models, if you're looking to scan in United States dollars for your in-basement counterfeiting operation, this Epson will prevent you from doing that via an &#34;Action Not Supported&#34; message:  &#34;This application does not support the unauthorized processing of bank note images.&#34;  Similar deal with copying.The fax machine...well, this isn't the 90's anymore, so I'm guessing they threw in that option for the few places that haven't heard of the internet yet, but I did verify that it did indeed send a readable fax.While all the features have been great, thus far the only &#34;problem&#34; I've had is that if the paper you're using isn't completely flat, it may pull through 2 when printing. So, if you can use the wide-format printing capability put this one on your shortlist.Epson is known for both quality and durability. and is capable of double-sided printing. Network printing should allow me to send a document to print every couple of weeks. Double sided printing can really save a lot of paper.Photo print quality: Very good. If you mainly do black and white printing then I would recommend a dedicated black and white laserjet printer instead.Standard black and white ink for this printer costs $19.99 for one cartrige for 350 pages at 5.7 cents per page.The XL Black and white ink for this printer costs $69.99 for 2200 pages at 3.1 cents per page.The color ink pack costs around $36 dollars for 350 pages at 10 cents per page.Compare that to a black and white laser jet which would cost $44.99 for 2600 pages (Brother TN360) at 1.7 cents per page. Very fast printing, low maintenance, quick setup and high quality print outs. The duplex printing is another must have for us and this has it. The wide printing path is also a nice feature.All in all I think this is a great product for the price.
