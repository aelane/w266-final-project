I like to stick the pen into the spirals of my notebook to keep it handy and this one gets stuck in there. For a disposable pen, this new line from PaperMate is a total joy to write with. Nice pen!". I purchased more and now am using these as my pen of choice. PaperMate claims that the Inkjoy pen writes without dragging, but it is similar to other pens. When I hold a pen to write with, I want for the ink to flow smoothly, and for the lines to be nice and clear. When using the pen, it feels slick, like it's going to sail out of control if I don't grip it tightly. The pen is a bit narrower than I expected and the rubber grip a bit smaller, but still overall it's easy to write with. I love a good pen and I use pens a lot, so I try new pens fairly readily. It's the smoothest pen I have ever used that wasn't a fountain pen. I find that a too-big or too-skinny pen will make my hand tire and cramp faster. It's a good pen. Each pen has a little colored ring at the top to indicate what color it is.If you want something that works well and looks nice for office use, I would definitely recommend these. For an inexpensive pen, this has some nice features: ergonomic design, firm grip, smooth inkflow. It is inescapably a cheap pen but exceeds expectations. I highly recommend this pen. As an avid pen collector for over 10 years, I can honestly say that I was very disappointed by the InkJoy 700RT. I'll keep searching for that perfect pen I guess! The older I get, the more I appreciate a good pen that writes as it should - smoothly and without smears and globs. The retractable pen also features an integrated contour grip to provide comfort and control while writing.The small ball of wax on the ballpoint pen tip needs to be removed before using. I usually like a pen with a little more heft but I do appreciate that these pens have a nice, smooth flow. Is it a nice pen that writes beautifully, looks professional but you won't sob if you loan it out or lose it? It is a very smooth writing pen that almost feels like a gel pen. Whether or not it's really worth $2 per pen is another matter.5 stars- REVIEW UPDATE -Six months after my purchase, I just hate these pens. I am not going to use the pen for important correspondence, however, because of the inconsistent ink delivery. I bought this pen because it was a papermate & the ad said it was good but it isn't. I wish these were all black or blue, since I am not sure how often I'll use the red pen.I
