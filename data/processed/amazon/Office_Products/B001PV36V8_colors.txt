I like that Post-It makes them in more colors now. It's helpful to have more colors if you are like me and use the color of the tabs to help you organize your files. The assorted colors allow me to create a unique identification for things I need to find. The colors help distinguish each section. The different colors help code everything as well.Recommended. I love the bright colors, quick application and flexibility. The bright colors are easily discernable and they come off easily (c'mon -- they're Post-its!) I especially like their different colors so that I can use them for different purposes - yellow for signatures, green for notes & red for most important discussions. I like the bright colors, though sometimes I prefer the standard primary colors. Because of the bright colors, the labels really pop making things easier to find. The colors allow me to color code references I need to be able to locate quickly (red for historical dates/etc., green for social customs, blue for religious connections, etc.). The colors are just a thing strip at the very top (which is a good place) but they could have maybe gone down all the way to the left side (so that the Orange wen all the way down the left side to provide additional color feedback. It's also nice that they come in different eye-catching colors, which makes for easy distinction between different types of files.They appear to be as durable as advertised, but are still flexible.The smoothness of the material makes it a bit easier for ink to smear, however.Overall, these tabs have really helped me get organized. Although the colors are not as bright as my colored filing folders, they stand up well and are quite handy when reusing a folder. The colors help organizing things and the color trim is narrow enough so that the writing area is not compromised. I wouldn't call the colors they come in stylish, but I like them well enough, and they are handy for creating instantly visually identifiable files by subject. The colors are also nice and bright so easy to see. I thought the colors were fine. If you want matching, you're going to have to look as I'm unsure the colors available.Otherwise these are great for those who are looking for larger tabs to write on and want colors to stand out. The colors are different enough to where I won't mistake one for another.

The different colors allow you to color-code your favorite appetizers, entrees, and desserts.These also can be used for datebooks, school binders, planners - wherever!

The different colors are nice, too, because they offer another way to sort and organize.As for the negatives, a few things come to mind.

Four colors allowed the use of categories.
