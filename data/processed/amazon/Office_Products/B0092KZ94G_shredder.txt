This shredder comes well-packaged. That shredder also had a powerful motor, but also a better-built and larger frame. This shredder's frame feels too lightweight for the heavy shredder top. Since I don't plan on moving my shredder around much, this is not too big a concern.Otherwise this shredder does its job. This shredder is so much cleaner in comparison.The machine's noise level is decent but not quiet. That shredder turned out to be an absolute beast - and I can't say enough good about it!Anyway, once our business moved into an actual store front, the 99Ci moved with it (where it continues to perform extremely well) and we went back to using a consumer-grade shredder (theFellowes Powershred W-11C) at home. That really wasn't a horrible shredder - but it wasn't even close to the performance of the 99Ci.That left us looking for something a bit quieter and more powerful for home - but that wasn't quite as large as the 99Ci.Enter the 73Ci!This little baby brings most of the performance of the 99Ci in a small & quiet package. )If you're looking for a shredder that will give you good security, performance, and features - while fitting in nicely in your home office, then I don't think you can do much better than the 73Ci! This shredder is unbelievable. It is by far the nicest, most useful shredder I've ever used.This replaced my other Fellowes 8 sheet, basic shredder. This is the quietest shredder I've ever used. Fellowes invented the first personal shredder back in 1990, and they have not slowed down since then! Just recently Fellowes released their 73Ci shredder; a new reasonably priced shredder with many exciting features.Jamming is the number one shredder complaint, and Fellowes is the only brand on the market with 100% jam proof technology. Fellowes new proprietary Energy Savings System maximizes your shredder energy savings by 100%; both when in use, and out of use.The Fellowes 73Ci has a touch screen interface to control the heavy-duty cross-cut blades. Is it possible to love a shredder? This shredder is definitely up there with the best of their products.Highly recommend! The shredder is indeed 100% jam proof, and it will accept 12 sheets, tops. It is much heavier than the "lid" on my older 18-sheet Fellowes PS-14Cs cross-cut shredder, which also has the "SafeSense" technology (but not the sheet sensor or the sleep mode). The shredder blades are easy to maintain, needing only a little oil after each binful, squirted across the shredder opening.This is actually my fifth Fellowes shredder. My third Fellowes shredder, a strip-cut model, performed admirably for many years--despite my continuing overload abuse. It was finally replaced with this cross-cut shredder. I donated the strip-cut shredder to Goodwill, and I hope it will continue to shred away for someone else who finds strip-cut shredding adequate. My fourth Fellowes shredder, the 18-sheet cross-cut shredder already mentioned, is still in use in my home office, after 3-4 years of operation and some overload abuse.Because the FELLOWS POWERSHRED 79Ci 100% JAM PROOF 12-SHEET shredder won't operate continuously when I shred unopened junk mail, I give it only 4 stars ("I like it" on the official Amazon scale). This is my second Fellowes Jam Proof shredder, and I continue to be very pleased. And yes, even a shredder can deliver that much bit of fun. There really isn't that much to say about this shredder except that it's a wonderful buy for those looking for a superior product. The shredder bucket is a nice, big size so I don't have to empty out as often. This is a great professional shredder, ideal for small companies or professionals who like to feel secure with their document-shredding. Also I wanted a shredder I could roll.After using the shredder for about a month I can report that my investment was well spent; the Fellowes Powershred 73Ci Shredder has chewed through everything I have inserted into it, including staples. The shredder motor--which will need to be oiled from time-to-time (there is a small bottle in the box)--is efficient and once in place does not have to be removed.T
