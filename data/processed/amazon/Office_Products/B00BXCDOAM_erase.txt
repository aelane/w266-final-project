The dry erase "ink" comes off very little on any sheet placed on top of it (but if you need a document to be flawless, be advised that small amounts of marker do smudge off the board.). Or, you can use it as a dry erase board or notes as it is also magnetic. You can write on it (dry erase marker only--no, really--don't screw that part up) and you can post notes on it. The dry erase surface works well and erases with no problems. I was able to buy a cheap dry erase marker that has a built in eraser cap and a magnetic body; I simply it attach it to the board via it's magnetic action. It also can by used with dry erase markers (if you have some) for notes. It seems quite sturdy, and I just love that it can be used as a dry erase board. Second, it's a dry erase board. Using the Document Lift's dry erase memo board for quick short notes to myself or to my family is my favorite part. You can also use the dry erase part with the clip as a sort of detachable clipboard. Also being a dry erase board is a handy feature.I dropped it a star because it really needs to come with a dry erase pen AND a place to attach it to the board or base.
