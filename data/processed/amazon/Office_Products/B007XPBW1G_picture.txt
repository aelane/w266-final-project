The picture or object that goes in that box can be bubble wrapped. Just a sample picture of something already packed and taped would help.That said, I'm more spatially challenged than most, and I have to disagree with the reviewer who said, "These should come already assembled". I was also pleased that it came with wrapping to make sure my picture went through just fine. When I used to to mail what I would consider a perfectly reasonable medium-to-large picture frame I needed to add in most of a week's worth of newspapers to keep the frame from sliding all over the place. I took a picture of the art (please forgive the use of such a word in this case) that I attached on the outside of the box so that when the time comes to revisit the storage I can tell immediately what the contents are and not go through the usual 'I wonder what is in that box' routine.Overall, great product and worthy of carrying the name Bankers Box. The first picture I packaged was an odd size as it was something purchased from an artist. I would measure my picture frames first though, so you can order the size boxes you need. These picture boxes work great, I was very please at how protected my larger pictures were. The Adjustable picture box sounds a bit more fancy than it is. Now instead of a picture standing alone or wrapped in bubble wrap I have a box around the picture as well.I have tried both the 40" x 4" x 60" adjustable size, the 48" x 4" x 33" large size and the 37 x 4 x 27 medium size. Then laid the other picture on top and did the same thing to it.There was enough room to place some smaller, flat pictures in the front of the box.I had some biodegradable shipping peanuts so I poured those into the boxes and sealed them shut.Seal the boxes up carefully and open them carefully when you need to and these boxes will last a very long time!
