No peeling it off.If this product and the old standby, Scotch Magic Tape, were available at the same price, I would probably buy this one for gift wrapping since the matte finish and secure sticking were nice on the gifts. Overall, this is a very impressive product that does exactly what it was created to do. All in all, this is a great product. They can take one product and make a thousand slightly different corresponding products from that base product. It is a superior product in every way. With this product, you just can't spot the goof up! This is a great product, and I don't see how I couldn't give it five stars. Otherwise, another great product from Scotch Like Kleenex, Zippers and Google, this is a product that's so good at what it does we pretty much refer to ALL similar items by its name: Scotch tape.Unlike other brands, however, this is a strong tape with a nice, satin finish that disappears against matte wrapping papers. This easy to use, long lasting product will be a staple in our household for years to come! All in all, this is a great product. A modest product, but one that delivers near perfection for the task you need it to do. I'm stuck on this product, and that is a good thing. Exactly what I was looking for and glad that Scotch developed this product. The product did what it said it would, and really that is what is important. If you do get this product, there will be no problem using it as a general purpose tape if you don't want to save it for future wrapping needs. This product might be marginally less opaque, but only marginally.3M's genius is in its marketing of its products.
