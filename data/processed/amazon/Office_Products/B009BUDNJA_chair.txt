Assembling this chair was an interesting experience, not least thanks to the minimalist "instructions" (just a simple diagram). This may not be an all-day, 8-hour working chair. This also may not be the chair for you if your waist is much larger than about 38". A good chair is among the most important parts of an office. Assembling the chair was relatively straightforward. This chair was very easy to assemble, which is valuable and not always the case with this type of product. This is a great chair for a home office environment, and you will not regret this purchase, unless of course, you fall into the "big and tall" category. And while adjusting the chair is slightly easy, this is where I'm very selective when it comes to chairs.For me and for ergonomic purposes, I need a chair in which the back side is straight and firm, the VL103 has the straight and firm back, which I like. But the VL403 adds this mid-back chair with cushion that feels fantastic on my back!I did like the VL103 Executive Chair for the chrome arms and chrome and base but I value comfort over looks and the VL403 Managerial is indeed comfortable and it looks good. While it's not an ergonomic chair that can be adjusted in many angles or settings, it's still a good chair that provides great mid-back support and great cushioning. This is a classy looking chair. ;)This chair holds my legs in a bit more.It does feel comfortable however it is a bit thin to my tastes. Every chair I have ever owned loses a lot of its comfort over time as the cushion becomes flattened. I like this chair, it's a functional chair for people who need to do light office work for short periods of time. I like HON, this is a good chair for the price, but I hope that quality assurance improves. 3 stars.The chair is good-looking all right and it is sturdy. The chair responded well to maneuvering it around, and the wheels are smooth. Raising and lowering the chair height is easy using the handle underneath. Ok first of all, you have to know that this chair comes completely disassembled and it does take quite some time to assemble.Instructions are very clear though.The mechanism quality is great (at this price, it should be) it feels very comfortable, it feels like it hugs your back in a very pleasant way. I'm using the chair in a Berber carpeted area and the wheels seem to have free movement without any squeaks or squeals. Remove the chair components from the box, check that you've got everything you should, look over the inadequate assembly instruction sheet, set inadequate assembly sheet aside, check reviews for more sensible suggestions, put chair together, and enjoy. What I didn't like about this chair is that the wheel base and arms are constructed out of heavy duty plastic. The HON Executive chair's wheel base and arms are constructed out of solid metal. The chair that I had prior to my HON chairs had a plastic base and arms, like this chair does; once the arms developed cracks around the bolts, it was a done deal: that chair ultimately went to the dumpster (and sooner than I'd originally expected it to when I bought it), after I spent far too much time and effort trying to patch it up and get a few more weeks out of it. It's MUCH more comfortable and supportive-feeling (so far) than the HON Executive chair was. The Executive chair looks modern and up-to-date, with its rectangular cushioning and black color, but this one hearkens back to the 50s with its more enveloping, comfortable cushioning and brown color. This chair looks as if it would fit nicely in an Bank executive's office, or that of an upper level lawyer's office. But I won't be throwing out my Executive chair; who knows when I might need those solid metal arms, and that solid metal wheel base?This chair is a good buy, even if the leather has the same bonded-leather appearance that my other HON chair has (same white mesh stabilizing synthetic fabric serving as the backing on the inside layer of the leather; does ANYONE make true leather furniture any more?). My chair has a very noticeable wobble to it, which makes it awkward to sit in. This chair was a test product, for the Amazon Vine Program, so returning it for exchange is not an option.So overall I find this to be a very nice looking chair, which is virtually unusable for me. I can't stand a chair that wobbles. This is the second chair I have recently tested from the HON basyx line. I will give this VL403 chair 3 stars, because it does look quite nice, and I am hoping and assuming that I just received a defective product, and that is why mine wobbles so much.I should also note that the chair is a bit more narrow than most of the other office chairs I have owned and reviewed. I love this chair! Overall the chair is great. To put the chair together DO NOT FOLLOW the instructions. When constructing the chair do take a moment to note the stamped 'front' on the baseplate, lest you put it on backwards as I did at first, and also don't tighten it all up until it's all together. Despite claiming that the chair is suited to 250lbs, I weigh 315 and have no problems fitting in it nor any doubt it will support me for years to come.
