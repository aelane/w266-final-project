I am happy with with the pens. I have only used the black pens, but I imagine that the other colors they offer work just as good. Really showed me that the free or cheap pens I had been using were "you get what you pay for". These pens were made out of recycled bottles, hence the name, Bottle to Pen, B2P. No, seriously.I am extremely picky about pens. Unlike pens made of other "eco-friendly" materials (cornstarch, paper fiber, etc) this one can be carried by healthcare professionals.It's a good-looking pen, with a transparent barrel (see at a glance how much ink is left) and a transparent blue pocket clip. Overall, I just love them and they will be my new go-to pens for sure! At least one can feel good about toting one of these pens around. By buying these pens you will be helping the environment which is always a good thing. I am also really particular about the pens I use and generally I don't like gel pens since they tend to have to be held in a certain way for them to not skip on me while using them. Gel pens also have a tendency to take more time to dry out and if you don't give them enough time, they almost always smear on you.The first thing I noticed when using these pens is that I didn't have to keep them locked in a certain position for them to write well. These pens basically look like miniature water bottles with a pen in it. These are nice pens that has a message to go green, and recycle. These are surprisingly great little pens. However, these pens prove that a product can be made that is both green and well made.These pens look great, a clear blue color.

I try all the new pens that my company orders, and I jumped at the chance to try one of these Bottle to Pen pens.I really like this pen!

I thought it would be flimsy or that it wouldn't write any better than my other pens, but I was wrong.

I've been using the new(er) Sharpie pens and I love those.
