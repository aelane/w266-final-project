I installed the printer's driver software on both a Mac running Snow Leopard and a Window's machine running Window's 7. Not sure why Epson did not want the 78 to be used in the printer, but it will not in anyway take anything other than Epson 79.The cartridges are around 22$ a piece and the Epson needs 6: Black, Yellow, Light Magenta, Light Cyan, Dark Magenta, and Dark Cyan. Got this printer out of the box and my first thought was "wow, this thing is huge!" That is when I discovered that the printer had changed my router's password and didn't bother to tell me about it. I could NOT get the printer sorted to obey my rules, as it appears to have a mind of it's own when it's set up wirelessly. The printer itself works fabulously and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for excellent quality. I really like this new printer. Setting up the printer to my wireless network was a breeze. I set up this printer to work on a Mac via wifi. For now, it works just as a printer should. Helpfully, Epson put their Buick-sized printer in a study plastic bag with handles. Still, I couldn't recommend this printer to a friend without a stern warning. This may be a great printer if you're using it only for photos. When you first look at the printer, you may be put off by the fact that there are no fancy screens or anything like that on it. It allows you to easily manipulate and print photos.This printer does not come with any starter paper, so I used some old and newly purchased photo paper to put this printer through the paces. However, I will definitely use this printer for regular projects such as posters, prints, and also some scrapbook pages. I think it would be the perfect printer for anyone who is doing Project Life or pocket scrapping layouts on a regular basis. They also let me keep the original printer's ink cartridges and sent me 6 new ones, so I was able to do some "free" testing as to ink capacity (see below). It's likely that the printer  was too far away from my router and the connection may have dropped (yes, my fault). In all, a nice (giant) printer for this price point. We put the printer in the closet and print from our laptop, desktops, and ipad/iphones and it works great.You need a USB cable (it doesn't come with it) for the initial wi-fi setup unless your router has the WPS symbol on it (ours didn't). However if you're looking for a great printer that prints Amazing photos and you don't mind not having some of the extras then this is definitely the best inkjet printer to get! I've had the printer now since the latter part of March so I've been able to give it a good test run.2) Our computers do not not have CD drives but we were easily able to download the set up drivers and utilities from Epson support. The HP printer setup guide stated that I would need to connect the printer via USB cable first, but this was incorrect. I don't know if the Canon printer puts down more ink than the other printers thereby soaking the page, or if the ink is more watery in consistency, but the finished product was unacceptable. The Epson printer also has the paper-abrasion setting, but it does not throw up a warning message and simply prints what you ask it to.CONCLUSIONAll three printers have their strengths and weaknesses.
