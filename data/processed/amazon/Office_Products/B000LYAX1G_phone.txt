I purchased this phone for my Mom who seems to have a way of killing cordless phones. I purchased this phone system because my current 2.4Ghz phones were interfering with my wireless network. ...I'm glad I spent a few extra $'s, and got this phone system. After having gone through several other phone sets that either lacked adequate reception or died after a few months of use, these are the real deal. When our last phone took an unexpected swim, it was time to replace it. I have been through several phone and ALL of them have disappointed until this phone.The signal is strong. I have my phone service through Cox cable with direct input into one those of GE insta-phone jacks that simply plug into an electrical outlet. So I use no phone line whatsoever and all 3 phones are perfect in clarity and performance. I am pretty happy with this phone system but not 100%. If this phone got rid of the annoying yellow light or at least made it less glowing, I would be a very happy camper. I have had this exact phone system for 6 months and loved it so much during the first month I had it I convinced a friend to buy it too. My last phone worked at the neighbors house with much "fuzz."
