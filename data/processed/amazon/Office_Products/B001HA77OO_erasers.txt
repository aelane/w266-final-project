I tend to use normal erasers, but when they are in my pocket they aren't the same size as my pens and pencils. I love these clic erasers. They erase clearly and do not smudge, and seem to last longer than standard erasers. They love these erasers; in the past they've had to borrow them from Auntie but now they can earn their own! I hate when erasers smudge, this one doesn't. I hate when erasers are hard to hold or fall off the end of a pencil, this one doesn't. I hate when erasers erase more than what I wanted to erase, this one doesn't. I hate when erasers don't erase, this one does.

In the past when we had the large erasers, we ended up erasing the entire area rather than just a small detail.

I've loved these stick erasers forever, it seems.

One of the best erasers I've ever owned.
