The magnets are very weak. The two magnets included for the front of the board are nice and strong magnets. The magnets that you stick to the back of the dry-erase board frame are not very strong.So far they have held up on my fridge but the board can be moved easily with just a slight bump to it. I will probably replace them with some stronger magnets down the road. Unfortunately, the included magnets are extremely weak to the point the board slides down a metal surface. Needs stronger magnets for the board, stronger magnet for the marker cap, and stronger adhesive for the marker clip. The magnets it comes with are pretty powerful too. Unfortunately the provided magnets that do this are a little weak and tend to slide down the fridge. It comes with two magnets that are more than string enough to hold a note or like item firmly. There's 2 magnets meant to hold notes on the front of the board, and I ended up just putting those directly on the fridge and then resting the bottom edge of this board on them just to help to keep it from sliding down my fridge. The 2 magnets that come with it are good for holding notes or pictures. However, the magnets are not strong enough to hold the board to a surface. I ended up hot gluing other magnets that I bought at a craft store to keep it up. Unfortunately, the mounting magnets leave much to be desired; otherwise this would be a really good product.The board comes with two-sided tape mounts, magnetic mounts and two face magnets. I like the little magnets that it came with, it's great to stick a note to the board when needed.All in all for the price I feel like this board is a great deal, I'll be picking up a couple more! The magnets are strong enough to keep it on the fridge. Mounting magnets and self adhesive mounting tabs are included in the kit. The magnets are not strong enough to hold the unit on the furnace side when it is running. There are 2 round magnets that I pulled on to see how strong they were and found they were REALLY strong, or so I though, at first. The magnets are not strong enough to hold the weight of the board. Once you have attached the magnets, you cannot remove them and use the pads to permanently attach it to the surface - not that I'd want to permanently attach it to my refrigerator.The pen does work well and I like the eraser on the cap. Some have complained about the magnets, but mine worked fine. I may be able to salvage the magnets from old board,.I'm going to try that and see how long it lasts but's it's kind of a disappointment since I know with proper magnets it would work like it should. The magnets are not strong enough to keep the board up. If you skip the magnets and mount it straight to the door, it will work just fine (until someone steals your magnets and marker). We have noticed that if you use other magnets, it may scratch the surface - the magnets that are provided have a thin plastic film to protect the dry erase board.
