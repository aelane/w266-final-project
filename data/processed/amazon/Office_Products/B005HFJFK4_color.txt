Letting Photoshop or the Printer decide on color set-up I'd normally opt for the Printer. The color prints are flawless and fast.You can hook your smart phone directly to it and print your pics! The color printing is excellent; I printed out a copy and then had trouble deciding which was the original! I typically just print black-and-white but will occasionally run a color document or a photo and this printer performs very well. It's about $65 for the color inks and $16 for the black on Amazon. I do a weekly full color newsletter and that print is amazingly beautiful.I have had this for only two months, so I can't comment on how it will do over time. With my old HP OfficeJet 6500, I ran the color cartridges out long ago, but I was always able to use it to at least print in grayscale or black-ink only. The Epson artisan 837 color inkjet wireless all-in-one is a perfect home office solution printer. From its color touch panel display to its ease-of-use, it is really a great printer. So it must have 5-6 color inks tank system. What I like is the color photo print is much closer to what I see on my computer screen. Canon had a red color shift so it was less accurate.+It has an ADF, which I missed since I retired myHP OfficeJet 6110. the color copies are spot on, the photo copies on photo paper are exact duplicates and b/w document prints are super sharp. but the color photo cartridges are lasting through several bunches of 4x6 and 8x10 color photos with only one replacement so far. my color photo prints on 4x6 and also 8x10 come out crystal clear, too. If you are just looking for basic color prints and aren't anal retentive about quality, go for the HP and use off brand ink. It is also very fast, even in color, you don't even feel like you're waiting. Who could have imagined a color desktop copier this cheap a few years ago?One  point needs mentioning: The ink for this printer is not cheap. Crisper I would say and the color is beautiful. We noticed the color wasn't nearly as brilliant on these as it was with the high quality paper.

The color prints are precise and and bright, black and white prints are sharp and there are a million (or so it seems) features. I used the color touchscreen to setup a static IP on my network connection and that was about it. The color printing speed is about average. Outside of color faxing, which isn't really new, there's nothing too exciting here...punch in the number, hit the button and off it goes.
