While I mostly use it for printing plain paper documents, I have found that the paper photo items I have printed are of good quality. There are two paper trays and also an adapter for printing directly on disc media. I guess this isn't "Ultra" paper, because the photo came out way too saturated and too yellow. It has a separate paper tray for photo-sized printing (4x6 & 5x7). I keep photo paper in one tray and the regular paper in the other. It's a bottom loader paper feed and not fed from the top, so this alleviates paper jam problems.JUDGMENT CALL:The Epson Premium XP-600 is a budget printer that may not have a fax, may not as print as fast as an Epson WorkForce printer and may not have the same capacity or use DURABRITE ink cartridges but people who just need the basics for school or home printing may find that the Epson Premium is all they need. I also purchased the epson paper and it is of good quality and the pictures come out looking crisp with it, so if you need paper as well, I recommend the extra couple of dollars in cost if in your budget. It has a 100-sheet main paper tray and a 20-sheet photo-paper tray. This is really nice as the paper is stored inside the printer and gives a true small footprint as it doesn't stick out.The other really nice feature is how you can use memory cards and USB flash drive. However, the dedicated paper tray for 4x6 photo paper is appreciated and helpful as soon as you get used to all the input and output trays on the front of the unit. I used glossy photo paper, and best photo setting for the 4x6, and I used glossy photo paper and regular photo setting for the 8x10. It had a paper jam,  and while following the instructions on how to remove the jam (open back, remove paper), a sprocket popped loose and broke in half. We would need to replace the entire paper feed mechanism (at cost to me).This printer worked fine until it broke in a surprisingly simple and irreparable way. glossy paper, etc.This time I took special note of which side was up- tried glossy side up - wrong choice again. It means a paper jam, but upon checking for one and turning off my printer and unplugging multiple times, I was not able to get my printer to be awesome again!
