The translator itself it relatively easy to operate, but the text labels above the buttons is maddeningly small for middle-aged eyes like mine. The translator is small and lightweight, so it would be unobtrusive to carry around.You probably already know the languages that it covers, but just in case, it translates to or from English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Japanese and Mandarin Chinese. If you're looking for a translator where you can enter your own phrase and except the unit to spit out the translation, this is not for you. However, this  well-priced translator, which doubles as an alarm clock, has enough pre-programmed phrases to certainly suffice for most people. This translator reviews simple words and phrases that could be useful when traveling. At first I thought that this translator might be too complicated to use but it's actually fairly easy and intuitive. The translator has eight quick categories, several sub-categories and a total of 705 phrases. I got this Nyrius Global translator just in time for my trip to Europe. It does not serve as a dictionary nor as a translator; in fact, there is no method here by which one may enter a word or phrase for translation.

Nevertheless, this tiny translator will help you speak so it can be understood.

The translator will speak a phrase you choose in your native language and in the language you want translated, so you don't even have to say the phrase yourself.Power is provided by two lithium batteries.

I believe that this translator could come in extremely handy for both travelers as well as those trying to learn words and phrases in a foreign language.
