I would expect them to last as long as the binder itself. And for me, that's plenty enough for one binder. Another binder might have schedules, budget, grocery list, and the like. I am thinking about picking up another binder and set of these dividers soon.These are available in 3-hole punch for use in 8-1/2 x 11 binders or 7-hole punched for small format binders and planners. I am a binder fanatic and keep almost everything organized in binders. This has become my new 'go to' binder. I had to manipulate it to get it in the binder. The binder is hard cover. I like them with my coordinating green binder - they give it a finished look. They fit in the binder well and you can write on them. I absolutely love this little binder and tabs! And the binder is great! I flip through these in their binder every day, multiple times a day and they seem to be holding up really well. The binder  is sturdy and functional. And, the binder has a clear plastic cover on the front so that paper can be slipped in for a customized cove.

You don't need a seven hole binder or special paper  - they fit my 3 hole binder perfectly.The best feature is that they are reusable and because they are plastic, it is easy to remove the previous title by simply erasing it.

But, I will say this, the binder is nice and I recycled my old one :PThe tabs are nice and sturdy and don't feel like they'll crack and tear off after a semester of hard work, and the fact that they're nicely color coded helps my tired eyes.

Get the green Comfort Touch binder and filler paper you'll be set to take all the notes you can handle....I am a sucker for all things stationary and this is no exception.
