Epson just continues to put out excellent printers years after year. I have had both regular-sized and "small-in-one" sized printers from Epson and unless you want a bigger machine the compact one does just as good a job but takes up a little less room which I prefer. It is also very different from printers I am used to working with. !I have had several Epson printers in the past and have never been disatisified. These printers feature a 2.5" LCD, 24000 dpi scanning and also offers EPSON connect, so you can print via smartphones, tablets and more. While most printers tend to have a user-hostile interface, this one is very easy to use that even your kid will be able to figure it out. Also, all-in-one printers at this price range can print out good photos, but never be able to match the quality from those high-end models.So, what factors to be used for finding a relatively good one from this over-crowded market? Some printers last longer before printer heads get clogged. One of my last printers last only for 3 months, while my last Canon printer last for 4+ years while being used on daily basis.Second is the cost of ink cartridge. Some printers are so slow in printing. Don't be surprised that some all-in-one printers are still one side printing only. Not as sharp as you would get from other high-end larger printers but the results were good enough to satisfy my needs. I used all three printers, and printed two copies each. I always like to have at least two printers in my office, so I will be switching from the Artisan/Workforce Combo to the Artisan/XP-600 Combo. I don't usually give printers 4 stars, mostly because ink replacements are expensive and designed to go quick and you can't print even just black unless there all four colors work. I have another of their printers, the artisan 800 class, and it's great.This one, however, broke within a week of getting it.

In both our other Epson printers, if you want to leave the output tray folded up and have your output fall onto the floor so you can roll over it with your chair, your printer will let you do so.

The best printers for photos are always inkjet printers.

As with most printers nowadays you can also crop, rotate etc.
