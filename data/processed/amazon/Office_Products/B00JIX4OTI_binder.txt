If you need a three ring binder you can carry with you easily this is so much lighter than the stiff kind. This is the modern binder which is much more convenient than the old fashioned kind. This binder is different from any other one I've tried. I was looking for a binder that had pockets and a place to write and hold paper. This binder comes with college lined and graph paper.The binder is strong, but flexible so you can bend the cover back, and write easily in it.I really like this binder, and I will be ordering more if I need them. The binder comes with 60 sheets of regular college rule notebook paper and 20 sheets of quad rule (how I love quad paper).Overall, I'm liking it and would buy more in other colors. It is also lighter and more flexible to carry than a standard binder, but stouter than a spiral notebook. It is a little more pricey than what you may spend on a binder or notebook separately but I think it is well worth and will be getting more! The Five Star Flex is a soft-cover binder with a fabric hinge and plastic rings that open individually. The Five Star Flex Hybrid 1&#34; Notebinder is a very durable binder that has a 1-year replacement guarantee for everything except abuse. This binder has a 200 sheet capacity and comes with 5 smoke-colored tabbed dividers (3 sleeves and 2 folder-types with pockets), 60 sheets of college ruled paper, and 20 sheets of grid paper.One of the things that I really like about this binder is the flex rings and the ability to fold over the cover like a traditional notebook. It truly makes this binder easier to use. If you prefer to customize your binder cover, this binder is also available with a customizable cover option. This is a decent binder. This is a very interesting binder design with only a few potential weak points. This is a good binder if you expect to not add in a lot of other papers and mainly want to write on paper you put in the binder, but a terrible option for frequent opening and closing. This is a three ring binder with a soft hinge instead of the typical triangle shaped binding. And it's like a binder because it has 3 rings so you're able to add whatever you need to and remove what you don't need. It states that it's like a 1" binder with a 200 sheet capacity.
