The file folders are cut down a little more than usual near the tabs, to accommodate the labels, which are about 3 1/4 inches by 1 1/4 inches. The file folders are in pleasant earthtone colors, three each of tan (my favorite), light blue, and light green.There is little more to say about them. We have the Smead Mo file box and these file dividers accompany the set. If you only need basic file organization & need tips for labeling, this might be a kit to consider. These are good file folders but I prefer Pendaflex EasyView Top Tab File Folder - 1/3 Cut Tab on Assorted Position - 15 / Pack - Clear, Assorted. I really think that file folders don't need an instruction sheet, basically you just use them. These are not the wimpiest file folders, but I do have some heavier weight ones that I know will last better. These 9 file folders are not worth anywhere near 8 bucks. There are nine regular file folders without hang tabs that fit easily into any common file box. These file folders are perfectly good, and the labels are just fine, but there's absolutely nothing that differentiates this product from other types of file folders. Nine colored file folders. I mean, nine file folders and a sheet of blank self-adhesive labels for $8? And if you are just needing file folders, I 'd suggest you go do that. I've got a great file system in my home office and my work office. So, I got the MO file case and this starter set and in the future the task of organizing my receipts will seem painless.Yes, it seems a bit pricey for what you actually get in the &#34;kit&#34;, but as a stepping stone to better organization, I can see its value. Nine file folders isn't enough for anyone's life and the price is too high.Jerry Heck , a file folder is a file folder , but what is obviously going to separate these from all the rest is the durability factor. They are manila file folders, and thin ones at that. It's 9 file folders in 3 different colors with a sheet of labels. no file box or wrap, no real system of organizing that is revolutionary...)Personally, I didn't find any of the organization suggestions all that useful or practical. These are your basic file folders only the labeling space is larger. These file folders were what I needed to get organized. They were pretty sturdy, not flimsy, like the old file folders I had. I would easily pay that for these 9 letter-sized file folders with a page of accompanying labels. I like that you get 3 file folders each of a different color. That makes it easy to separate out what's in each file just based on color alone. If you only need a few file folders and not an entire box of them, then these should do fine. They are just as durable as any other file folders I have used in the past. It's intended to be used with the file case (sold separately) which can be housed in a standard file cabinet or within the file case wrap (also sold separately). If you are needing to do some basic file keeping, like a home improvement project, medical data or some one time event that you need to document, these kits are very useful. If I pull a file, and take it to my desk, or anywhere else, I don't want to worry that something may fall out, especially if it is something small, like some kind of receipt, etc.. I am not sure why these are included or what they have to do with file folders or serious organizing. I don't know what they are thinking charging $8 for 9 file folders.My recommendation is to look around Amazon for something cheaper before buying these. This file folder starter kit has what you need to get started with your filing. Summary: NINE file folders, three in an attractive buff , three in a powder blue and three in a sage green.N
