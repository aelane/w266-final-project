This product is a notebook, made for carrying to out of the office work. This product offers you about 3/4 of a white page and 1/4 of a yellow section. I will buy this product again. The second I opened this product, I knew I could not use it in a professional setting. It's a Mead product so it's a pretty reliable brand and has held up well so far. Very happy with this product. Its a great product. With a product named &#34;Business Notebook&#34;, I was expecting something with professional quality and professional features. The product photo makes it appear to have a pocket in the front, but that is an illusion. The product description says &#34;perfect for use with smartphones&#34;. This product is almost perfect for that.The ONE BIG CON is that it's hard to look back into your notes quickly. After using this product, I have learned it is meant for specific uses.
