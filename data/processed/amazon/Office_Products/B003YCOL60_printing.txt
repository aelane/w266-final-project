* The "automatic" two sided printing is rally nothing more than printing on one side, and the printer prompting you on how to refeed the paper to print on the other side. I do most of my printing with a laser printer - but it seems like I still need color occasionally and this printer is great for those times. If this is 2-sided printing, then ANY printer can print 2 sided. "Automatic 2 sided printing?" Double-sided printing is automatic, in the sense that you need not flip over the printed pages manually as with some printers. The printing resolution has a maximum of 5760 x 1440 optimized dpi and the printed pictures in 4x6 turned out great! The two-sided printing is awesome, as it's done at the same time. Text printing quality is about the same and my eye says the photo printing is actually a bit better than the HP. So far the printing and scanning have been great. And it will do automatic double sided printing!Setting this printer up was a piece of cake, and it came with FULL ink cartridges, not 'test' cartridges designed to make you buy 4 new ink cartridges after 5 prints (like my HP's did). This goes for scanning, copying, printing, really impressive.-Quality of output - photos and documents are crisp. I haven't tried printing from my cell yet, due to issues with the phone company, but there is an option to do so. It doesn't sound like it's going to fall apart while its printing like some of the older printers did. I was pleased to see that if you enable two-sided printing, a message pops up suggesting that pages with a lot of color (and hence a lot of ink) may take longer to dry, and that you may want to dial back the "intensity" setting in that panel.The Stylus NX625 has separate ink tanks for its four colors, and Epson provides full-size tanks, not "starter" tanks.
