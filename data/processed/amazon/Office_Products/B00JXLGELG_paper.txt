This one prints them all perfectly without jamming the paper or smearing the ink.You can scan from both the main platen and also the document feeder at the top. It holds a LOT of paper. And I love that, because it's always irritating to have to reload paper right in the middle of a job. The paper feeder for the copier is excellent and no jams on my uses thus far.There are two SD card slots on the front left plus a USB slot. I'll have to use OEM photo paper and ink. Also, I have had some paper jams using 4" X 6" photo paper. Maybe the Polaroid paper is too thin but their is no problem running through one at a time.I'm still glad to get the WF-7620. To start, it is massive, it has two paper trays and a large touch screen display. But I&#8217;m not willing to waste paper and ink to find out how much they will actually print.I like that it has two paper sources so you can have two paper sizes. I still haven't found 13x19 paper - I have a project I'd like to try! The 7620 is slightly larger than the 7610 due to the extra paper tray. I also tested it with larger sized 11 x 17 paper and it worked fine. It would be much faster if printed single-sided because flipping the paper over seems to take extra time.Overall though, the print functionality is great and the print speed is commendable. Two paper trays, so we don't have to keep changing the paper. Two huge paper cartridges and another feeder for envelopes and such. The paper trays are easy to load. As far as regular paper prints, it's no slower than any other printer I've worked with and the quality is fine.
