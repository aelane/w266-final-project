It is not in the printer settings BUT the box had a manual with it-yet to read. So far I am very impressed with this printer. I am a low-volume printer user in general. I've had this printer sitting in the box for over a year and finally had to use it. I had this printer up and running in under 15 minutes on all of my computers (one desktop and 2 laptops). I have been using this printer for a year. This printer definitely isn't worth any more than that.Cons:Scanner is not good for picturesCheap built quality, all plasticSoftware is not goodCheap design, paper sticks out in the airBulkyPros:Good for price (80bucks back then)I only needed something to print documents and this does that no problems.I was looking for the cheapest temporary printer. I didn't expect this printer to last long-term and this fits what I was looking for.If you are looking for a good quality printer that settles in your home, I do not recommend this.

This is my second Canon printer.

We have this new printer out of the way in a closet since there are no wires to connect to the computer.

It fits nicely on a small printer stand and the document tray is substantial, not flimsy.
