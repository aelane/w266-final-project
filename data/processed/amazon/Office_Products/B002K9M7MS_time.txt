The 3M Permanent Adhesive Shipping Labels stick very well so align them correctly the first time! I'd definitely buy these next time we need shipping labels. I am glad to have taken the time to test them and write this little review with praise for the 3M Permanent Adhesive 2 x 4 Shipping Labels.Good stuff. At this time of year, shipping labels are much needed. But for the first time I ever put a sheet of labels through the HP, no problems at all! So saving these for next time won't take much of my  space at all! At one time when I was doing a lot of shipping I had ordered over 5,000 labels from Avery only to find that after letting them sit overnight waiting for pickup they were starting to come undone from the boxes! Immediately after writing each time, I swiped the edge of my hand across the label to check for smearing.They passed the test.

I reuse packaging all the time, and these are substantial enough to obscure any writing underneath them, such as addresses on old labels that you couldn't remove, or on envelopes themselves.

At this hectic time of year, it was really nice to work with a product that made Christmas package mailing a little easier.

I will likely purchase these next time I need labels.
