This mouse pad is large enough to use with most kind of mice and the gel wrist rest is really comfortable. I didn't even realize just how small my other mouse pad was until this one arrived. It's basically the perfect mouse pad. The mouse pad is a sturdy plastic-like surface and using an optical mouse with it caused the mouse to not track correctly. It would be a nice mouse pad for using with a regular mouse as it is sturdy and the wrist rest is comfortable but for my purpose of using it with an optical wireless mouse it did not work. This a well-constructed mouse pad. I really love this mouse pad, its so easy to use and just fun to enjoy. I will never buy a really cheap mouse pad again. This mouse pad is nice, well made and  great color.It is comfortable to use and if it wears as good as my other one,I am replacing I will be very well pleased.

My wrist gets very sore from using the mouse; have even experienced numbness.

This mouse pad made a big difference immediately.

It gives a little but not too much.-The mouse area has plenty of room & is a hard surface so the mouse moves easily/smoothly.-The underside of the pad "sticks" to the desktop so no excess movement.
