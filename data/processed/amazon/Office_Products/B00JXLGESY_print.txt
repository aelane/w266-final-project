I think they provide around 2000 print pages.ConnectionsThe printer can be connected via WiFi or USB, but the application that upgrades the firmware and monitors the general printer status only works on WiFi. The direct print from Android works (I don't own an Apple product so I can't speak to Airprint) - again, provided the printer is used via WiFi. I suppose it might be useful for sending print jobs to the home office when traveling, as opposed to having to fax in, but I'm not sure it is that much better than simply emailing a co-worker.Summary: A fine printer for basic home office use, with good paper handling, simple cartridges, great output, and many features. There is 2 sided print, copy, and scan. The print jobs come out looking amazing and the quality is super high. Once it has a print job queued up, it just spits out page after page. Enter Epson&#8217;s new Precision-Core print engine which the WF-4630 utilities. The print outs are amazing on any kind of paper. You can fax, scan, print and more with this all in one device. The print quality is amazing. The basic print, scan and fax are great but being able to print from a phone or tablet is something that puts this unit over the top. I'm impressed with the print quality, ease of use, and power of this as a WiFi printer. A dedicated print cart or cabinet would be preferred if you&#8217;re going to be keeping this one out at home. I can say the print is excellent and the ink is lasting and lasting, which I can't say about the Brother. Photos print fast, and look great, if you consider this is not a photo printer.The Epson WF-4630 also multitasks, as I was able to send a document to print while I was scanning using the ADF.Another great feature is the Wi-Fi Direct connectivity.
