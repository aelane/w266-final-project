So far, this is the only Noodler's ink I own (out of a half dozen different colors/types) that I can use to write in my Moleskine journals -- the ones with the thinner paper -- without the ink bleeding through to the other side. This ink is a satisfying green. Thankfully, I still had old Watermann ink cartridges and they will hold me for the time being. I only use this ink in a TWSBI 540 as it has not clogged and continues to write smoothly! I will never use this ink in my Pelikan or Vanishing Point!! The ink is nice. This is by far my favorite ink. This ink is absolutely beautiful, very much a dust rose like color. I have this ink in two of my pens right now, a vintage flex and a platinum preppy it writes good in both.

I am using this ink in a Pelikan Pelicano and it writes beautifully.

If you use this ink and have not had problems with it either staining or otherwise destroying your pen, you've got a great blue.

Oh, also, this ink does feather much more than BS Grape.
