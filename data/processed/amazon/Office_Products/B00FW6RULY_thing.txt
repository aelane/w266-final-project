And that's a good thing otherwise stuff would be sliding out of the sides at the first sign of any tilt. The only semi-bad thing about this is that papers can easily slide out the sides when you are reaching in there to get something (since there are no sides, it is just open). The only thing that could be better is that the opening is narrow at the top, and the unit is hard plastic so you can scrape your knuckles when going to retrieve mail from it. The only thing I don't like about it, is it's not a pocket. One thing I do like about it is that it would be easy to customize by covering it with fabric or paper, because the outer surface is totally flat. It seems like such a simple thing, but having this on my fridge to store my most recent bills, and papers that need to be filed really reduces the clutter. Easy to pull just one thing out, or add another. This is mostly a good thing as it provides flexibility, especially for those large envelopes.

So they call this thing an organizer.

It may seem like a little thing but it bugs me.

The thing doesn't budge.
