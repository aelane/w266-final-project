When the eraser wears down, one simply pulls out the eraser and flips it over. The eraser stayed in its holder, and I did not need to apply so much force that a lead would advance.These are very good pencils. I also like that there is another eraser in reserve once you wear the first one down. All you have to do is pop the eraser holder out of the top of the pencil, flip it over, push it back in, and viola - another eraser.The eraser doesn't leave a lot of debris on the paper, and it picks up pencil lead very well.The HB lead together with a 0.7mm lead make it likely to smear relatively easily, but it doesn't bite into the paper like 0.5mm leads sometimes feel like they do.All in all, a great pencil. The eraser is 3/16th" in size and works well at erasing marks. Flipping the eraser over to the replacement is quick and easy. The eraser holder snaps out of place, and snaps into place to keep it held. When pressing hard to write, the eraser s about 85%-90% effective. The eraser fully removed pencil markings made by my daughter and myself, but left a bit of ghosting when my son erased an error on his homework. The dual sided eraser will likely be very useful come standardized test time, and the heavier leads will prevent frustration from snapping leads. They provide an interesting back-up eraser holder, are relatively comfortable in the hand, and are otherwise what you would expect. The eraser removes pencil marks cleanly and without any smudge. When the eraser is depleted, just flip the plastic sleeve over and use the second eraser at the other end. I like the double-ended eraser...great idea. I just flip the eraser and voila, a clean eraser appears. The eraser flip is probably my favorite feature. And it's RETRACTABLE- when you hold down the eraser of the pencil and push down on the pencil, the entire nib retracts so it won't poke through through your bag or your pocket and impale you when you least expect it. When you wear down the eraser, just pop it out, flip it over, and use the eraser on the other side. The eraser is absolutely perfect! I always hated running out of eraser on my mechanical pencils; it made me want to throw the pencil away instead of keep using it. With these Paper Mates, you just take the eraser and flip it over, and there's more eraser on the other side...and then when that runs out, there's still more backup that comes extra! When you wear the first eraser down, you pull it out, flip it over, re-insert it and have a brand-new eraser.I tried the pencil and eraser on several types of paper. The flip-top eraser is cool and nice to know you have a backup eraser handy if you run out. How do I gauge an eraser? This Paper Mate eraser is not up to that challenge.And is that asking too much of an eraser? The dual-sided eraser means that you won't run out of erasing power in a hurry.Pretty much the only change I would recommend is that these pencils have an eraser cap, like the Pilot G-2 pencils come with. That would ensure that the eraser stays clean and so does not smear the page when you're erasing stuff.Apart from that, I think this is a great mechanical pencil for work. I understand the eraser issue that my daughter has, many of us have that issue, and the flip (pull it out, flip it around, and re-insert it) is made to address that issue. Each eraser is in a little holder that holds the eraser nicely, and keeps it from getting pushed deep into the end of the pencil, like other products have done in the past on me. The double eraser is a nice touch--when you have finished with the eraser on the end you can pop it out and flip it and a second eraser is at hand at all times. Plus, I like the eraser which will last twice as long by reversing it after one side is used up and the non-smudge feature does seem to work. I finally gave up using the eraser after it fell out and bounced under my studio table. The eraser slides in and clips, so when you are in need of the second eraser, you simply press the lever to slide out the eraser and flip it over. This is much easier and you have that back-up eraser on board already.With no flaws (it's a pencil - it writes and it's comfortable! This gives you double the eraser on the pencil and when you run out, you can just add in a new eraser.The reason these aren't 5 stars is because I found the included #2 lead felt a little hard. The eraser removes most of the writing (as much as any of our wooden pencil erasers) and you get twice the eraser with the new "Quick Flip" feature.I have similar .7 mm mechanical pencils by other companies, but this one has a nice feel to it--almost like writing with a pen. I always run out of eraser before I run out of pencil lead, especially with a refillable pencil. Nothing worse than when an eraser fails and smudges more than it erases. The eraser isn't as smooth, and it seems like it will be used up quickly. The eraser flips over for continued use. When your eraser wears down to a nub, you simply push the tab and pop it off, turn it around and you have a new eraser to pop on. And yes, the eraser does flip over so that you get two good-sized ones with each pencil. Once the eraser wears down, you only have to pull it up and flip it over to find another eraser segment ready to go. Meaning you use the eraser as you would like any other. But when you run out of eraser, BOOM you pull it out and flip it and a new eraser is there to use! The eraser is adjustable, replacable (important for all the erasing I do) and erases so cleanly that you can't even tell anything was erased!
