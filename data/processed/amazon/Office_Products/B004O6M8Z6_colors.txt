The colors are fairly vibrant, and with 8 of them, you can do a lot of designs. And, the colors were true to color. The colors are bright and vibrant even after washing, and I didn't notice any real problem with bleeding ink. They work great.I love the:* Selection of colors. The colors are bright and water fast. The colors make it a lot more fun!Note: the "stained" in the title is an appropriate descriptor both because of the permanence and because of the transparency. What you get are colors much like stained glass. The colors are sharp and true and very vibrant.The direction brochure is kind of useless with stupid cartoon examples. )Like the colors that are provided but wish there were options that were less bright and beyond the primaries. The colors are great, and are perfect for staining. Darker colors definitely will make it harder to see your art project and may change the colors a bit.Still, the kids had a blast! The colors are very florescent and may be geared more for kids, hopefully they will come out with more realistic colors in the future. The colors are all nice and fast. The colors are vivid. The colors also don't fade over a short period of time (Have been using the shoes for months now and colors are still very bright) It is likely possible to make brown by blending the colors gently, but I don't want my pens themselves to become stained which can happen when you use the pens  to color over other shades.I like the pens and recommend them. The colors are bright and stayed that way after washing them in cold water. But these colors definitely did fade slightly when washed.Overall.... great product to use to exercise your imagination with shirts or hats or shoes. The colors are a bit more vibrant than regular sharpies but the brush tip smooshes easily and does not hold it's shape. The colors were bold and beautiful - did not bleed or wash out in the wash. The colors will not stay and do smear quite a bit when not used as directed. The colors appeared bright on the white T-shirts we used although my daughter says the pink is too pale. I like the colors and the way the markers work on fabric. I found the colors to be fairly true and was quite happy with the set of markers. The colors that come with this pack are varied enough to use for craft-type activities. The colors stayed on after one wash (so far) and we'll have to see how they stand up to repeated washings.
