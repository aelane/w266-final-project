The dual paper trays are great as well since I occasionally use special letterhead for business projects. The scanning itself is not very fast.Printing is done from one of 2 paper trays that can store anything from small photo paper to long legal paper (legal only in casette 2 though). You select the paper "casette" from the print dialog of the printer driver when you print. Using some HP paper that I had, however, gave "cloudy" results that we were not able to fix with the various settings available with the driver. You can also print up lined and graph paper, however you can only use tray 1 for this. The two paper trays are very handy with a large lower tray, and a smaller upper tray that can hold 500 sheets combined. It's very nice to not have to constantly switch out paper to print photos. I don't know about you but I buy my paper by the case to save money (It doesn't go bad) and then tuck the case back in the corner under a pile of stuff, so every time I run out, it's a moan and groan experience.Although this is a "wet jet" printer instead of a laser which is superb at saving you money on the cost of printing, I understand that main black cartridge lasts a very long time. The paper trays sound as if they are motor driven. It has two separate paper drawers, both large and accommodating, so that you can have photo paper in one and plain paper in the other. There's a paper output tray (another improvement when compared with HP's offering, where paper output just drops on the floor) - it's a little flimsy but it gets the job done.So on the down side, the only real negative I spotted is that color photo printing was somewhat slow. ):  This isn't about actually the paper you use, but rather, the really awesome cassette system in this printer! So I won't be slamming the paper trays in like you would on a business grade computer.Upshot - I LOVE this printer -- it is the best I have ever had and has all the features you like about the printers you might have in the office. It also has 2 different paper trays, so you don't have to worry about changing out paper often. It handles it well and saves paper. I put the cheap paper on tray 1 and set the printer default to print first to tray 1 and then to tray 2. Tray #1 can take paper size up to 8.5" x 44".This is certainly the fastest inkjet I've encountered. )* Two paper cassettes with a 250-sheet capacity each, and the Workforce 840 can even handle paper sizes up to 8.5" x 44"* There is a function on the touch screen panel to print out various ruled papers - pretty cool! The WorkForce 840 can easily spit out graph paper from a built-in printing function. You can also print out  paper with a watermark type background image. I love the two paper trays, since I do print a lot of photos. the photo paper came thru first, part of the picture was printed on it, then the rest of the picture was printed on the regular paper that came right behind. I need to print on plain paper as well as shipping label sticker sheets. The negative is that Tray 2 can only accept 8 1/2 x 11 paper, it's Tray 1 that takes anything smaller. (The cheaper the paper, the muddier the colors because of how the paper absorbs the ink. So, you cannot just leave photo paper in one of the trays while using the main one for other work. There are two paper trays, which honestly, is a pretty great bonus, and the machine directly accepts all kinds of cards - SD cards, XD cards, MS, CF, micro-drives, etc. You will probably not run out of paper for a project if you load this thing to capacity! The paper drawers may seem a little flimsy, but everything is working great and I am VERY happy with this unit. No more bent paper from it leaning over for weeks waiting to be printed on.- I don't mind the software. Big built-in paper capacity (500 sheet paper capacity)3. The two large paper trays that hold an enormous amount of paper make this a must own. Haven't  tried it on 20 lb paper, but doubt it would be a problem. It also doesn't provide a paper profile that would be applicable to printing something on heavier paper (such as cover stock or card stock). We leave one loaded with printer paper, and the other loaded with business sized envelopes. The paper feed seems to want to feed all of the paper in at once when there is not much paper in the tray.It frequently feeds an extra blank sheet through with the one it's printing on, so I end up having to sort out the blank from printed pages.Making a copy seems to take absolutely forever, and if I'm making multiple copies, each additional copies takes as long to make as the first one. The paper trays are large capacity so I am not constantly having to refill them. If I want to change the paper in this tray, it is awkward unless I remove my print outs and fold up the tray that holds them.
