But this Teacher Pro sharpener may change my opinion. The sharpener is very large and takes up a lot of real estate space on your desk. This sharpener is large and weighs nearly 3 and 1/2 pounds and is intended for the classroom, not the home desk! This also is not a very fast sharpener (takes 10-12 seconds for each pencil). We have an existing electric sharpener that is half the size of this sharpener - but it is a piece of junk. I have three electric and one manual sharpener in my house. This automatic sharpener is smart - you can't grind your pencil down unless you pull it put, wait, stick it back in. While I am not using the sharpener in a classroom environment, obviously any high-use environment whether home, the classroom, or office setting is what this sharpener is designed to tackle. The sharpener tries to deter a user from sharpening too long, by having an indicator light come on at the top of the sharpener, and a cutoff, when the sharpening is complete.

With this sharpener, I don't have to tire my hand doing that.

When I found out that this is the sharpener that all of the teachers at my son's school use, it was a no brainer for me to at least try it out.

This sharpener is much bigger in person than was evident in the picture above.
