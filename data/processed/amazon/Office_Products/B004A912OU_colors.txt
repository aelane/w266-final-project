I tested all three colors. The colors are bright, and they photocopy well. I have been using the Sharpie pens almost exclusively for the last 6mo and really like them, but I haven't been able to find them in any colors. I used all three colors in the package and each pen performed with equal grace. The colors are, Red, Blue, and Black.The Red is more of a tomato Red, Blue is a definate blue not dark, and of coursethe Black is black.When I wrote with the black or any of the colors , then ran the side of my finger over it, it did not smear, but the color came off a bit on my finger. All three colors are great. The colors are not as vibrant as my Signo or my Pilot G2. As for colors, the red is OK, though I prefer a darker color. The colors are well-saturated and bold while having a relatively thin line. All 3 colors, black, blue and red are vibrant.The pens are thin and comfortable in my hand. That they come in three colors is a plus, and it's fairly easy to tell the colors apart by the translucent barrel and cap. Good colors, nice and smooth, comfortable to feel...basically good pens.
