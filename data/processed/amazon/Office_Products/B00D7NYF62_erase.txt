Otherwise, this is pretty straight forward - a dry erase board, magnet and dry erase pen included. I am happy with this dry erase board. This is a practical 11x14  inch magnetic dry erase board with a white writing area. You get the dry erase board, two round quarter size (approximate) but thicker magnets for the front of the board (there is double sided sticky tape on the magnetic surface of the magnets, presumably to hold them in place until you buy and open the package), a small flimsy dry-erase marker and a reseable little bag that has the rectangular mounting adhesive and the rectangular mounting magnets. This is a lightweight dry erase board. Also included are a dry erase pen and magnets for pinning things to the board. Also in the dry erase marker cap is a small dry erase eraser. I am using this dry erase board to keep track of my grocery list (I take a picture of it with my iPhone as I walk out the door. This dry erase board is standard 11x14 size (ledger paper size). This dry erase board is great! Overall it's a great dry erase board which works well and can be hung in many places. This is a nice dry erase board. This dry erase board works as expected with regards to writing and erasing with the use of a dry erase marker. We love using dry erase boars in our homeschool. My first dry erase boards and can't believe I have not ever got one in the past! This magnetic dry erase board is well-sized for the back of a closet or pantry door (where we have ours), or for use in an office cubicle. It's a dry erase board. You can write on it with a dry erase marker and erase it. Good dry erase board, could use stronger magnets...the ones whoch are included held it to the back of our steel door, but not well. Otherwise, it is an attractive dry erase board with the benefit of being magnetic.One other thing is to be careful what kind of magnets you use.T
