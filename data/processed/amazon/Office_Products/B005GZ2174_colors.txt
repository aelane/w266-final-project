They come in nice, vibrant colors and they stay stuck, no matter where you post them.For me, these are a great improvement over standard Post-Its (great as they are), simply because standard notes sometimes get "blown away" when someone walks by, only to be found sometime later, languishing under a desk or chair (along with their vital data--"handle this ASAP"). Different colors and sizes are just icing on the cake! And the bright colors are going to catch the eye, which also makes the useful for posting reminders! The colors in this assortment are a bit garish- hopefully they are or will be made in the more muted pale yellow of Post-it notes of yore, but when you need a paste-on that will stay put this will serve your purpose. I also love the colors and the rounded edges and can see myself using this often. As always, bright colors for attentions sake. The colors were very bright. I got the "bright colors" package and the variety is perfect. The colors are vibrant and the paper is is first class. I love alternating colors to brighten up the notes I send to my staff, and the original yellow ones were getting boring!When leaving notes around the house for hubby, or a reminder before I left the house, I would have to tape my regular post it's with scotch tape. I like to use different colors for different things. And the colors are great, too.

The colors are bright and very noticeable!

The colors are a bit pale, but strong enough to make your writing stand out.

The bright colors are great for organizing the things you want separating one from another.
