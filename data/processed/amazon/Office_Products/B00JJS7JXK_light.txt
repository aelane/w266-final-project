But for now, I have the light under my desk that I have so long wanted. So this light is helpful.My son likes how it looks and it doesn't take much space either. Good light for locker use. The FIVE STAR LOCKER LIGHT is a handy, inexpensive light that I am sure works well in school lockers. This light does require Requires 3 AAA batteries and give a off a nice light. If you need some extra light in dark places, this is a good, inexpensive choice. As for the light, it's not really that bright. Before you send this light to school (or take it to work), be sure to install the batteries first. This is a nice little light. It won't be a really bright light in that big a space, but it will bright enough to see by and I can take another light with me if I need it brighter. One light is not enough? I guess you don't need a bright light in a locker. If you need a small, bright and magnetic light that can brighten up a small location like a closet, locker or even some place like a cabinet, this is a good choice. This is also a GREAT light for a boat, if you want a little extra light someplace. At first, I was mystified as to how to open this light to install the 3 AAA batteries.There were no directions, and all I could imagine to do was to remove the 5 tiny Phillips screws on the back.When I found a small enough screwdriver, and removed all 5 screws, nothing came off to allow access to the battery compartment.I started to try to pull off the magnetic backing, but soon realized it was going to tear before it would come loose.What could I do?I turned to Amazon Reviews, to see if anyone else had faced this problem, and if there was a solution.A review mentioned the problem, and said that after the 5 screws were off, the front part--with the LED lights--should come off.I had to shake it a bit, but finally the LED panel came off, and I was able to insert the batteries and reassemble the unit.So, after all that trouble, and the lack of directions, why did I still give it four stars?Because other than the initial battery installation, the light is great.It stays firmly on a metal surface (like a locker) and puts out an amazing amount of light. And the six LED light bulbs are not very bright; replacing the light bulbs is also very challenging. This light is amply bright and easy to turn on & off. It is bright enough to cast sufficient light in a small enclosed space like a locker (though I'll be using it in a cupboard) and the magnetic back holds the unit well. We found this magnetic light to be perfect for placing on the furnace, when work needs to be done as well as on cars when checking fluids or just adding light when doing repairs. Once working it has a pretty nice light and a strong magnet.

Now thanks to this light, I can easily find and grab what I'm searching for, whether it's a broom, a pair of garden gloves, or a box of tissues.

This is a nice, bright light that does light up a locker-type space fairly well (I put it in a linen closet).

The light does a nice job of lighting-up my closet.
