This product is as good as the competitive product, cheaper and I like the color a lot better. What a great product, the paper is even thicker. Great little product that Amazon Vine sent me for a trial. Good product. These are another great Avery product, and work flawlessly. That's why it surprised me that they are currently more expensive when the closest product is compared Amazon to Amazon (price per sheet). To me, that means that the product should preform just as well or better. Obviously this product is in competition with Post-Its or store brands like Staples "Stickies". This product sets itself aside by offering Box Tops for Education so if you participate in that program that could tip the scale for you. A fine product. It's hard to make a product any better than the original 3M Post-It notes, but AVERY STICKY NOTES are just as good.There's not any real difference in performance of the sticky part, size selection, color selection, or price between the new AVERY STICKY NOTES and the long-established Post-It notes.Pretty much, the deciding factors boil down to  1) what's available when and where you're buying them,  2) brand loyalty and/or 3) the "Box Tops for Education" coupons on the AVERY STICKY NOTES packages.Only YOU can determine which of those three things figures most importantly into YOUR decision. Avery Sticky Notes are an excellent product to keep by the phone or computer to write little notes. Good product, but nothing new  to the market. These are okay, but not as good as the original 3-M product. The product I am reviewing is product code 225141. This product is from Avery. Good product. Avery's Sticky Notes are a quality product.
