It would be nice if the colors were much different - two shades of pink seems unecessary when there are many other colors out there. easy to use, and the different colors making being organized a snap! And the colors - well, the two shades of pink are pretty close as is the orange. The various colors allow for different reasons to id the page. The colors help for more convenient filing, and I find them easy to write on, more so than the competition. The five colors are also helpful if you are color-coding your bookmarks and references. The bright colors stand out. Nice, bright colors and great value (250 per package), also add to this being a product I would use (and buy), again and again! The bright colors help with color cordinating a special section in each of five colors and just the size for marking the sections. The colors stop just short of being fluorescent but are certainly bright enough to find easily. You can shuffle the colors and they have just the right amount of adhesive. The colors are brighter with Avery, the tabs are slightly wider and longer, too. The colors make them easy to locate. The different colors allow you to identify different themes. The bright, eye-catching colors make it easy to spot and with five colors, they can even be color-coded. I really like the colors of these page markers. The colors are fun! The bright colors stand out, which is good, and the page markers can be an effective part of studying for tests, finals, etc. Bright colors...sticks well...writeable surface. The bright colors make all the learning a bit more fun. They come in 5 bright colors, stick where you want them to go, and are made of a matte-finish paper that's easy to write on. The different colors can be used with a color-coding system, and because they are paper (not glossy plastic) they are easy to write on if you need to make notes to yourself. They are nice bright colors and stick well to paper, mirror, doors. They work, colors bright, stick well. There are 5 colors that come in the pack of 250 markers. I find the colors bright but not annoying, and the adhesive is adequate for temporary use. The multiple colors allow me to create my own organizational color codes. The bright colors are great so they do not get lost within the pages of books or magazines. they stick better, and have better colors. I like the bright, eye-catching colors. There are 5 colors, 50 sheets per pad. The colors are also bright enough that I don't lose them in the pages of even the thickest book. It makes it very handy to have 5 colors in the same package and there are a good number of tabs in each stack. So the bright colors are what first attracted me, but I've found these to be truly useful. It also states that the colors may bleed when wet. Great colors. Let your colors fly!!

They love the colors and no matter where they stick them, it causes no harm.

The colors are bright enough to allow you to use a color-coding system for your page-marking needs.

The colors aren't as bright and shiny but that really isn't important and they still come in different colors for color coding if you need that feature.
