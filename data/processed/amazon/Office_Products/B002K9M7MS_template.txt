Not as popular, but certainly usable is the 3M template 3100 S.I like the  labels as they pull off nice and clean when I need to handwrite an address. The template does NOT guarantee that labels will be aligned correctly. I'm using 13 year-old Word 97, but even that had the exact template required, so in about 20 seconds I had the label page all formatted to match the sheet and I was off and running!This package includes 25 sheets of ten large labels, with little spaces in between each label so that they are absolutely effortless to peel up. It's not visually apparent where you can type in the 3m template, but you'll get the hang of it. I downloaded the 3M template from 3M.com/Labels and it allows me to enter different addresses to do a whole sheet of labels, or I can put in one address and cut and paste to the other boxes so when I ship an item I readily have the label.These labels would also work well the old-school way.....just slap it on the box, write on it with a permanent marker and put a little clear tape over it.Either way, you have a nice sticky label that won't be peeling off. They are compatible with the Avery 5163 template so you can choose to use Microsoft Word for identical templates or the 3100-S Word template from 3M's website for individual addresses.They are marketed as laser compatible but I had no problems using them with my HP inkjet. Match the template with the product and be assured that your design will fit, be centered and print out as you see ity on the screen. The Avery template is available in Word, but you have to re-space it to prevent it from printing right on the edge of each label. I only wish the template was easier to find, but that's because I'm using Apple's Pages program, and not Microsoft Word which has all the Avery templates in the program. The Avery-compatible template worked perfectly and I printed on the same sheet several times without problems (I know this isn't recommended but - let's face it - in the real world it happens). A MS Word template can be easily downloaded from 3M's website and this template works fine in OpenOffice. I downloaded the Avery 5163 template and Avery wizard for MS Word from the Avery site and used that template with these 3M labels. Download the Avery template, type in your address, afix the label, ship your package.Having these labels on hand allows me to cover up addresses on reuse shipping boxes or heavy duty envelopes, which does allow for recycling. It will send you a template for using with your specific labels. For the 3M 3300-A, I used the Avery 5260 template for laser printers. This is the same as the 5160 template for ink jet printers. I used the Avery 8163 template in Word and it worked just fine. I downloaded the template from 3m.com and it worked fine. The template allows you to use different text and formatting in each cell. They were very easy-to-use, stuck well, the Avery template worked perfectly, and they stuck to the appropriate packaging well!I would definitely recommend these, especially if you are looking for a substitute for the Avery ones, without giving on the quality side: these are a nice thickness, without being too bulky, and are still easy to peel & adhere: loved them! Enter the template number (same as the model number) and download the template. The template is provided is a DOC format. Standard template, 250 labels total perpackage for well south of ten bucks. This wasn't just with one template, or even on only 1 printer...tried on 3 in my home and same thing on all. The downloaded template was lined up perfectly with the printer.
