Instead, turn the stapler upside down and pull gently up on the forward portion of the foot.The stapler takes what I consider to be standard sized staples The 105 quarter inch size from my Arrow works fine. This is the stapler you want on your desk when working on a big project. Highly recommend this stapler to everyone. I'm using this stapler to replace a traditional Swingline 747 Stapler that vanished from my office desk a few months ago. I don't recommend this stapler. I couldn't stand my old stapler and by old I mean about 20 years. This replaces an old stapler that I have had for years, one that you really had to pound down on to get through several sheets of paper, and would bend staples etc. This is a great little stapler for home use. It is mostly plastic, unlike my 1970s Apsco compact stapler, so I'm not sure how long it will last or how long it would hold up in regular office-type conditions, but for occasional use for up to 15 pages at a time, this should meet your needs just fine. Load up the stapler, add it to your briefcase, and be ready whenever you need it. This stapler will drive the staple pages with almost no effort on your part.It requires about the same effort as a regular stapler for multiple pages.For a test, I stapled three sections of the newspaper together several times.Each time, I got a clean staple holding the sections together.No partial bends, no crumpled staples and no unbent pins.The unit is smaller than a standard stapler and is nice looking.The loading is different but not difficult.Just follow the directions on the stapler. This is a great stapler, and it takes common standaerd staples.It's easy to load with new staples, and can staple multiple pieces of paper.Recommended! Holding the stapler in one hand and a stack of 15 sheets of used paper, the stapler worked perfectly and almost effortlessly, even with my arthritic hands. The stapler comes preloaded with a rack of about a hundred staples.Bottom line: I love this little stapler. This particular stapler is very easy to use, and easy to load. I personally own two of this stapler's big cousins (PaperPro Generation II Hi-Start Stapler (1460)), and those staplers are the best I've ever owned. I never thought I'd find a stapler I like as well as my ancient black industrial strength Aceliner stapler. I had never seen a stapler liek this that helps you. The PaperPro Evo Compact stapler is small, lightweight and easily fits in the palm of my hand. Because it's such a small stapler, having it sit horizontal is not a problem.Overall, a great little stapler that performs as described. I liked the PaperPro Evo stapler. I have an ancient Swingline stapler at work that was old when I inherited it 24 years ago ... incredible how much difference there is in how hard you have to push.Very compact: Obviously compact means that the Evo holds fewer staples than a full-size unit, but it makes it more suitably sized for home use or in an office where you just don't staple that much. It also keeps the stapler from slipping around on the desk while being used.Didn't jam: I don't know about absolutely jam free operation, but it never jammed while I was testing it.CONS:15 sheets? A stapler only has to do 3 things well, in my opinion:1. When I saw this Paper Pro stapler offered, I jumped at the chance to have it.Well, it's ok. This is a good stapler but, if I had to choose, I'd choose the staples brand. I decided to try this stapler because I'm tired of banging on desk top staplers to get them to go through more than three sheets. This stapler works with one hand and zaps right through a stack of paper. This is a compact stapler that fits snugly in your palm.Significantly  lighter than its bigger sibling Paper Pro II" which I love but the Paper Pro II is easily 4 times heavier than the EVO because the EVO is probably 70% plastic. Once you are familiar with how this stapler loads, loading really isn't an issue. But if you just have this stapler on your home desk and use it intermittently, it's great.The stapler is light, feels good in your hand, and it sort of shoots the staples through several sheets of paper (but not really thick documents) -- I don't know how they managed this feature but it works. This stapler is absolutely awesome for stapling 15 pages or less and for home or office use. This little stapler feels sort of cheap in your hand, but it does exactly what it is supposed to and does it very well. This stapler is between those two. It seems a perfect stapler for students whose professors still require hard copies. However, it is the best compact stapler I've found so far.Be sure to read the instruction on the box about how to reload the staples, it isn't intuitive. I'm very, very pleased with this stapler! This stapler arrived in its box, tucked inside a padded envelope. I find I prefer to hold the stapler in one hand and squeeze it together. Simply hold the stapler upside down and slide the anvil arm toward the rear to expose the staple chamber. With the stapler pointing upward, fill the chamber with one-half a strip of staples and then slide the anvil arm back into position.All in all a nice light-to-medium duty stapler for home or office that has a very small footprint. This is a very light, compact, comfortable to hold and use stapler. I absolutely love this little stapler. This stapler is a very good, small size and fits easily in my hand.

I had my own stapler at the office I worked in, but a few days before I retired in 2009, someone lifted it.

I've missed that stapler, so I was glad to try the PaperPro Evo Compact Stapler.

And it's a dandy little stapler if you don't need to staple a lot of sheets together.I tested the stapler with 20 lb paper (75 g/sm).
