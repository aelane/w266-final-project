You have to be sure you have the latest Windows updates, since this software uses some of these recent updates and will not function without them. Once the software is installed and working properly (it took me about 2-3 hours to finally get it to work), then you connect the scanner and you're ready to go.To test, I scanned a couple receipts in the "Receipt" slot of the scanner. So the software saved me some time by reading the receipt for me, and I filed the captured text and an image of the receipt.Then I tried some business cards, which there is a special slot for on the scanner. It appears that the Neatworks software does not attempt to 'read' these scans and you just get an image of the document, which you must type in the details about it and file it. I think that because the software is mediocre in my view, they should offer free software updates for the life of the product. The software CD has a PDF manual under the Help folder, and that has been copied to my desktop and is currently open. I wish I could use it without their software (maybe you can but search me how - maybe I'm not that bright). The OCR software wasn't very good, so my PDFs weren't searchable. I also have the Neat software remind me every three days to back up the database. I like the software's interface, layout and functions, but support for keyboard shortcuts or a customizable toolbar would make using the NeatDesk even better for power users. The software also has some stability issues that really shouldn't exist on a scanner that costs nearly $400. Once the software is installed, you need to enter your serial number to attach the software and hardware. Same software but a slick bar-shaped scanner, at half the price (and more convenient if you do your receipts on the go) The software is very easy to use. After setting up the software on my laptop, I plugged the two cables into the obvious receptacles. It's non-intuitive and I feel like it takes longer to keep organized with their software than if I just used a simple, old-fashioned accordion folder. They want to make sure you run and install the software CD first before plugging in the machine. The software scans in the background, so you can keep working (like boxing or shredding your completed papers). It scanned perfectly, and the software indicated it was 'cash' (hee hee) but did not indicate the denomination.7) Since I was testing it, I decided to do something of a stress test. First let me say that the software is amazing!! All I do is tell the software where to file this. I would prefer to just use similar software with my Canon MX700 All-In-One. I really disliked the software.

I am not sure what you'd do if you lost it...I guess ask them to send you another one.The NeatWorks software is really nifty.

This was handled just fine, and the software was easily able to pick out the correct dollar totals.

Not surprisingly, the software was completly flummoxed by this one.
