When I'm shopping for a printer, I usually look at the price of ink, make of machine, size and then functions and options, in that order.There's nothing worse than feeling like you got a bargain, only to find the cost of ink crippling.The replacements for ink (and I recommend the named ones from Canon) are not cheap, but also not outrageous, just consider that before you jump.Print quality is excellent, double sided is nice also, even if it's a bit fiddly. Updating from Sept. 2012...it is now August 2013.Set up of this relatively inexpensive, heavy, and large printer was sometime straightforward; and at other times a difficult process, necessitating a call to the Virginia toll free number.The printer promises a myriad of printing, scanning, and copying options. This is not my first Canon Pixma printer. The printer front cover opens right up so accessing the ink is very simple.Ink: This is a lower end printer, so the color cartridge is combined. I've found with my past Canon printer that we tend to go through the ink pretty quickly. This printer is no exception. The Canon Pixma MG3220 is a great printer. I highly recommend this printer as your go to for all of your home office needs. Okay, the printer takes any photo paper up to 8.5x11 (standard typing paper size).The PIXMA MG3220 takes two all-in-one (sort of) cartridges. The printer goes through all kinds of "adjustments," and finally after a minute or two starts to print, and that's in BLACK. It's as though the printer was coloring within lines. So, would I recommend THIS printer? This printer does not have LCD panel. The printer head is included in the ink cartridge. This is not a small printer, but it's wireless, you can put it anywhere you want.6. The printer does print in duplex automatically without flipping the paper around.2. So, you always get the new printer head when replacing ink cartridge.In summary, for this price, this is a very acceptable machine. Then, the printer detects the wi-fi settings that your computer is connected to and uses those.After that, I spent a week using this printer as my primary printer. Besides, it feels more intuitive to scan while you're there at the printer rather than setting up and crossing your fingers that no one messes with it until you finish your scan or going back and forth to scan multiple pages. If the printer is in a different room than your computer, this is a real pain and annoyance.In terms of print and scan quality, I do think the MG3220 is slightly better than my C4795, but the differences are negligible. I've never seen a printer grab bandwidth like that, so that surprised me. I needed a second printer for a family member's computer. If the printer has not been used in a day or two, the first page printed will take a while to come out. This printer is amazing. This printer is very inexpensive and worth every cent. This printer does what is suppose to but there are features I don't like about it. I feel like I should get a new printer every couple of weeks. I had a Brother printer I really liked but it wouldn't run on the Windows 8. When I first got this printer, I couldn't complete the installation (as in it never finished) following the directions, on a mainstream currently patched Windows7 system. I was frustrated and set the printer aside. Although this printer was the default printer and I was able to test-print to it, on startup EasyPhotoPrint simply said "no supported canon printers found". The printer did react very slowly while it connected to my network, but this was only a matter of a few minutes. This printer lacks a traditional paper tray -- and, that's a very good thing. This printer produces the best prints, on both photo and normal paper, that I have experienced in a home printer. This printer does not, but, for  me, this is a plus because my phone service does not support fax. What the printer does is it will print the first page out then feed the paper back in and turn it around and do the second side. This is pretty aggravating as it was the only functional printer at the moment in my house and now I cannot print until I get in touch with support and try to figure out what happened. I ended up plugging it in and using it as a wired printer, because when I originally went to set it up, it seemed to set up but when it didn't work it was not clear what was wrong or how to configure it. However I am reasonably satisfied given that I was able to use it as a wired printer. The Canon PIXMA MG3220 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner and Copier is a good, basic printer with scanner and copier capabilities. I think Canon is the best printer maker period.

Buy a printer that uses more affordable inks.

TL;DR SUMMARY:  I found the Canon PIXMA MG3220 to be a solidly functional printer.

Turning the printer off and on again would resolve this, but it's an odd error.
