Granted one wouldn't want to do this for 100 folders but it wasn't a problem for setting up a dozen folders. Like other folders, if I jam too much into these folders, they "disappear" and the tabs become impossible to read.The Smead SuperTab Folders are constructed from a fairly sturdy oaktag-type material. However, because these folders are bold colors it is harder to read headings written directly on the tab. However, because they were not, I felt the brightly colored folders made it difficult to read writing directly on the folder and deducted a star. Further, these folders are fairly expensive, so unless you are somewhat compulsive about organizing your files, standard beige file folders are a better use of your resources. I bend the folders to fold at their widest capacity, write on each tab the occasion--birthdays, sympathy, etc.--and place several folders in a hanging pendaflex folder. Nice folders, I like the different colors and the large tabs these are good manila folder, nothing more to say about a folder. Manila folders are so boring, period. These folders are nicely made and the colors are a nice touch. What makes these folders different is the extra space in the tab area. The folders are sturdy yet thin.Enough said. I love file folders, and make regular (daily?) These are all-around great folders. The folders look and function exactly as described, and I couldn't be happier. As folders go, these are fine but the one "feature" it has is not a feature at all. That said, if you are using these folders to organize things, say, photos, receipts or newspaper clippings, it would be ideal!I really liked the assorted colors; it just adds another dimension of organization. The folders seem as thick/durable as ones I've used in the past so no complaints there. I really like this folders and found the larger tabs to be well worth it. They are a little thinner than many folders, but sturdy enough.You get a roughly 1" tab just like most other folders. Be careful though, these folders can likely slice through skin pretty easily (like all do! These folders are well made and will last. I do find regular folders kind of cramped when it comes to making detailed labels or using large type.I use these for special folders that I use often like ones that hold my credit card statements, as well as important folders like ones that hold income tax related information. So, instead of buying brightly colored, "nice" folders from the container store, I got these.

I notice that both folders are about he same width, but the SuperTab's body  is noticeably shorter.Both folder types are the same size at the tabs.

Blue, green, yellow, red.File folders I can use.SuperTab?

The folders are fairly heavy and should, in most cases, hold up well.
