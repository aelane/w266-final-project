So the eraser on the pen is more like a tool for making heat (hence the friction) and nothing that is rubbed onto the paper.The penbs are great, except for a few things:- the ink is really a dark grey color. The eraser on the tip of each pen won't last too long inactual use.The Pilot erasable pens are superior to the early Bic brand of erasable pen. Unlike a typical eraser, this is not removing the top layers of paper so this really doesn't damage the paper. The eraser cleanly clears any errors, to the point where you would not know you've made a correction. ), but the eraser somehow stays clean, too. The eraser works very well, on freshly written words, and on words several minutes old. They usually stopped writing quite soon, and that abrasive black eraser often damaged the paper. It's not really an eraser though, and leaves no rubbings- it's just a soft part to produce friction and remove the ink.

The Frixion's eraser tip won't wear down through time as it is the heat of the rubbing motion that removes the ink.The pen has a sleek feel in the hand and writes smoothly.

The eraser part is pretty cool, the ink is heat sensitive and when warm enough (140 degrees F), the ink fades away.

The eraser on the end of the pen is used to provide friction which generates enough heat to erase the ink- very clever!
