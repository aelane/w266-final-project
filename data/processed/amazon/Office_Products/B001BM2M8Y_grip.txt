It absolutely delivers when it comes to a comfortable grip, and I am really pleased with that aspect of the product. The grip is just right and the dispenser easy to use. Great rubberized grip feels very comfortable, which won't cause it to slip out of your hand. The grip fits nicely into both a small woman's or a large man's hand. The "easy grip" is really what they say it is: very smooth, angled just perfectly to help you easily glide the tape around your package--especially great for those of us who sell stuff on Amazon! Scotch easy grip packaging tape dispensor is one of those nice to have but not must have items. The grip is pretty good, though the item as a whole doesn't feel like it will last as long as it should. I like the rubberized grip, no slip and feels good in my hand. The Scotch easy grip's handle is soft and extreamley easy to use. I have been using the easy grip dispenser for a month now, and the tape has stayed where it was supposed to be and haven't had one problem with it! The grip is comfortable and soft. They said no, and I liked it just fine, the soft grip is especially nice so no issues there.
