I'll agree the ink itself is exceptionally smooth, but there seems to be a problem with the ball bearing tip.Perhaps it's due to the extreme angle at which I tend to hold my pen and the rhythm of my stroke, but these pens simply made a mess when I tried to write with them. The ink is "slippery" and actually globbed in puddles as I wrote; the output was equally bad, whether writing in cursive or printing in block letters.Judging from the many other positive reviews here, I suspect it could be the shallowness of my writing angle. Finally, I noticed that the ink smeared easily if I wasn't careful to allow it extra time to dry.If you are looking for a pen with a very wide line, these pens are nicely made, and the writing is definitely smooth; I also like the click style. Yes, the ink can smear but other than this problem, this pen is certainly one of quality and one worth owning. They write smooth, and the ink flows easily. The ink does come out thicker than the usual cheap pens but occasionally clumps. Unfortunately, the ink began to glob on the paper and on the tip after writing very little with these. The ink flows very evenly, without the blobs one finds from time to time with other pens. Also, the ink bleeds through the paper slightly because I press hard when I write.....now, if you have smooth looping style letters and a light touch....this might be the pen for you. I like how the oozing ink makes my writing look stylistic. The ink does go onto the page nicely (no scribbling little circles in the corners trying to get a flow). The ink goes on the paper real smoothly, but there is some bleeding at the start and ending points of words. The ink does not dry quite as quickly as a regular ballpoint pen. The ink kinda fades in and out. It's definitely the smoothest ink pen I've EVER used. I should have looked behind my ear first instead of last.I love the very dark ink color and the thick, padded barrel. The ink flow is nice and consistent without 'overflowing' or blotting, and they just have a nice, even writing feel. However, I hate when the ink smears onto my hand. The ink is even and flows out well. The ink just flowed--no skips, all even--and honestly, it just felt smooth. Like other gel ink pens this BIC Velocity pen writes very smoothly. The ink writes with medium thickness and is easy to read. The ink is deep black, and dries quicker. The ink isn't stable on the page, so sometimes it becomes lighter, sometimes darker.That's a big no-no for me.The rubber grip was too far back for my smaller woman's hand, so my forefinger rested beyond it near the tip which was made of hard plastic and became irksome after awhile.

They don't write well, they aren't very comfortable - they are just your basic, cheap ink pen.

The ink--almost a cross between a gel pen and a ballpoint--flows smoothly which makes writing easier than with many other pen types.

The ink does dry rather quickly, but it is important that it be allowed the necessary drying time to avoid this problem.A good pen can make a difficult writing task much more pleasant and BIC Velocity Bold passes the tests of quality and easily earns an above average grade.
