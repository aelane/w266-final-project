I absolutely love this machine! Overall very happy so far with this machine. The Workforce 3540 is a very adequate machine for not too demanding printing, scanning, copying and faxing. It is not the fastest machine, as an inkjet, but does not take exceedingly long either. I love this machine! Again, I say this is an awesome machine and I love it....wish I could give more than 5 stars. It's a heavy machine, and not small, but it fit with relative ease on the top of my own office desk. With the Windows machine there were no problems whatsoever, however the Apple machine just didn't play as well with the unit at first. This machine has two diamonds with a vertical line (one labeled color, one labeled B&W;) that are the start keys for whatever function you've selected from the touchscreen. Everything about this machine is a time saver.The touch screen is super sensitive & very user friendly. It is a great all-in-one machine! It is a great all-in-one machine! (The machine's footprint is just about the same size as the printer that is already taking up the desk space in the office. You can use the machine as a copier for up to 30 pages at a time. The machine will do double-sided printing and collate. .Marvelous machine! Overall,  I'm very happy with this Epson machine. Very nice looking machine, great copy and scan quality.
