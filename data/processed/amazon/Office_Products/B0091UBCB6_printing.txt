Although I have yet to try printing from my smart phone or tablet, it seems easy enough based on the simple menu layout and the convenient Epson App I have used on my phone previously.Wireless connectivity is excellent, even over a fairly wide range across my house. Though double sided printing does slow the machine down a lot it really is worth it. Two sided printing was excellent and fairly quick. I have not tired printing from my tablet or smartphone -- but that is mostly because I don't seem to need that function myself. I can not compare the printing cost of this machine to my old Canon as I haven't had it long enough to see if the ink runs out more quickly or not. for printing and scanning plus front-and-back printing options.- Wi-fi. It's important to note that printing was the same between the WorkForce WF-3520 vs. the WorkForce 840 in terms of pages per minute.Single-sided printing was very quick and both earn high marks for printing single and double-sided in color and black and white.Also, what is important for me is that if there is a paper jam, you can easily remove the rear to fix any problem. I use it for basic printing and am sure I am not maxing out the technological capability this printer has.uThe biggest con is that the printer will tell you an ink cartridge is low and after that you can't print. the two-sided printing  feature is really neat. The two sided printing is amazingly fast and all my printings have been perfect as well.Epson makes my favorite scanners and the WF-3520 is perfect for my everyday stuff.I also feel I should mention the fact that an old school corded FAX is included, while the use doesn't come up all that often, occasionally I get someone wanting to send me one, so I'm covered to receive or send a FAX as well.I am currently using 6 computers in the two offices, both PC and Mac. 2-sided, duplex printing is nice to have and works as advertised, even if I probably won't be using it much in the home. Photo printing is also good, though slightly dark (this can be compensated for once you know it). Fast printing and long lasting cartridge. Oh, I forgot to mention that 2-side printing is fast and easy too. I have only used the printing function so far and this unit really prints fast.... assuming it will last I would recommend it. The only other "negative" I have about it is that I cannot use cloud printing from my Galaxy S3 phone, but that is not Epson's fault (the phone can only print to Samsung printers). It's very simple to use.2-Sided printing.

Double sided printing worked well.Photo printing on glossy paper produced sharp prints, although they seemed a little dark.

And printing from Safari, right in the print options you can select single or double sided printing and number of copies - quite useful.But printing websites that have a lot of graphics does the usual "over-saturated feeling" paper if you're just using regular paper, curls some and just feels WET.

The actual printing is crazy fast!
