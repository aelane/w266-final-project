If you want firm, almost unyielding support, then this wrist bar is for you. Whether firm or soft, thick or low-profile, fabric or soft vinyl, your wrist support must match your own needs.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann It is a touch too firm for my taste.Overall, I am happy with the wrist rest. The firm gel seems more durable than the others too. I found this to be a nice firm rest, with the right amount of heft to it. Boy, was I wrong... it provides a nice firm, yet cushy surface that stays cool and comfortable no matter how long I type. Its pretty firm too, not mushy like other gel rests.It is anti-microbial which is nice as it inhibits the growth of bacteria which causes stains, odors and such. It's very firm, which is great for typing it seems, but being so firm doesn't work for using the mouse. It's a very comfortable firm gel and washes off easily.

The firm gel creates a comfortable cushion to rest my hands and the leather-like texture is both attractive and appropriate for any home or business setting.The seams appear very well joined to the flexible plastic base and should provide years of gel-ooze protection under regular use.Can't yet speak to the anti-microbial protection since I have yet to lick the surface but so far I haven't caught any illnesses.If you're looking for an attractive, durable, and reliable wrist rest then stop going to the bars looking for Mr.
