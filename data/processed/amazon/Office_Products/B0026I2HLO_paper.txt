I have been paper threading for many years and this is my third Fellows paper threader and I am quite pleased with it.I LIKE:1. When you think about it, do you really NEED a paper shredder? This isn't a bad paper shredder by any means. This is a good paper shredder however it is not real heavy duty model. Even reversing sometimes will not clear it so I have had to resort to tugging and pulling the paper as hard as I could to remove it. When trying to clear paper from the underside be very careful! But I don't shred paper for an hour at a time so it's not an issue for me. They kept jamming the paper. Do NOT put in more paper than it can handle. I've had a few paper jams but was easily cleaned out. This paper shredder works really well. All cheap paper shredders are noisy and will eventually fail.

Even when the paper began to crunch up against the side (which constantly jammed our old shredder) the W-11C just ate through it without jamming or slowing down.

If you have one PLEASE put your paper in GENTLY.Needless to say, I will buy a new shredder, and it will never ever be a Fellowes brand because of the bad policy of not making replacement parts available.

So you need to lift off the top occasionally and push down the shredded paper.
