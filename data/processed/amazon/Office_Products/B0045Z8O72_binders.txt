It seems that most of the binders that we buy either break down, the vinyl rips, or the rings stop working right. I used binders all through college (not Trapper Keepers) and through adulthood. However, we still use a few physical binders around the house for keeping certain items quickly accessible, including recipes, which we ended up earmarking this Avery binder for.The reinforced binder is nice primarily for the added grip. I use binders quite often for work projects so I'm very picky about quality. Some binders do but this one does not.All in all this binder is handsome looking and appears that it would be a bit more durable than a standard binder. Many binders like this have very sharp edges where the plastic is quite capable of giving you the world's worst paper cut. I use binders a lot. Some new Avery binders advertise no ink transfer, so I hope this one is made that way, also. Most binders are difficult to open, you have to really push or pull the metal tab, it makes a loud noise, and it's awkward. I use binders to organize my monthly bills and this one has held up very well to my daily use. I don't know that it's more "comfortable" than other binders, but the black edge gives a touch of class that plain white binders don't have, and is easier to grip.

With Avery binders, you always know that long time will be reallly long.

Plus, I seen binders with a pocket or window for business card.

Like most Avery binders, the rings on this binder seal tightly together to minimize risk of snagging/tearing the holes on the paper.The inside of both the front and back covers have pockets, and the outside has clear sleeves so you can insert pages of text, art work, etc.
