Some are "glued" so lightly that they easily fall off the page. These little page markers come in a variety of bright and attractive colors. After I've referred back to the marked page, I pull the marker and use it to mark a new page or a different book. They are perfect for marking a specific page in a book. I love these page markers, they are perfect for study!They can be written on for quick reference searches, or can simply be placed for most often used pages.I would bet they could help anyone from students to bible class attendees.I have used them for simple bookmarks (they can be attached and reattached) AND I have also used them in reference manuals for stuff I need to research often and fast.I am not sure how I was so efficient before these. I have to stick them well onto the page or else I have long tails sticking out of the books, and I am afraid of snagging them on something and tearing either the tags or the book pages. These Avery page markers are exactly what someone needs when they wan't to create a reference to a page. The page markers come in very bright colors which help to separate different articles. The Avery page markers remove easily with no sticky residue plus you can write on the markers to identify pages. These are handy little page markers. These Avery page markers are hot on your heels! You can move them from page to page several times before they need to be replaced if you are careful with them.However, when I wanted to use them as tags for some books I was going to sell, I found one weakness. Although the page markers stayed on the covers of the books well enough, they do not have the sticky staying power needed to continue to stay on when the books were moved around. If you only need page markers for papers, especially interior pages, these will do just fine, but if you use these for a lot of alternative uses you may be disappointed. These vibrant page markers are a great way to save your place or note something special. So having page markers like these are super. The come off the page easily without leaving a mark. Avery page markers are a fantastic tool for students who need to bookmark important pages of novels, textbooks, or any other important books. So for me these page markers are an excellent solution. These brightly colored page markers are wonderful for keeping track of pages.You may use one particular color for recognizing a certain subject within the pages of a book or use a color to signify the most important pages. These page markers from Avery are a nice way to mark sections of a book or document without doing any damage to the pages with bending corners or highlighter markings. At first I was concerned that the entire page marker was solid instead of being partially transparent like the sticky flag product. They stick on the page perfectly and leave enough room for you to write on it. If you're looking for the little page flags, these are the ones I highly recommend. However, after being stuck to a page inside a book for a week, its grip becomes more tenacious; tags that have been in place for a while may "skin" the paper under tham when you peel them off, especially if they are stuck to old pulpy paper. These Avery page markers are fine for marking places, and you can write on them to help organize your notes or use the different colors to mark different themes. I recommend these page markers. Avery's page markers serve my needs very well. These Avery page markers are exactly as advertised and are exactly what I expected. Avery page flags sticking capability is much superior to the post-it brand I've been useing.They stick much better, and remove easily.But a caution on the package says "colors may bleed out",so I tested this Avery flag with Post-it brand.The Avery bled a lot, the Post-it didn't bleed anyand I feel that somewhat limits my use of these flags.Handy uses of flags for me have been marking favorite recipes,and organizing a project or bills.They're handy for reminder notes on our stainless steel refrigerator,because magnets won't stick there.I leave flags in my recipe books among others, for future reference.In yet another test of these two brands, re-appling them 10 times over,the Avery was still sticky like new, the Post-it still stuck, but barely.The two cautions Avery mentions are 'adhesives may mark some sufaces or lift inks',and 'colors may bleed when wet'. These handy page markers are great little tabs to use in reminding you of a page of importance on anything from documents, to books, to magazines. Avery's page markers are the perfect size for piano keys, and the adhesive doesn't damage the finish.I have yet to find an Avery product that I've tried that hasn't proved to do a great job for what it was designed for, and I've often found that they work great in unexpected situations, too! These page markers surpass any that I have used to this point. I refuse mark up a page, nor will I turn down a page cover, so these have turned out to be perfect. These page markers are about what you'd expect: a piece of colored paper with weak adhesive covering part of the back. They do exactly what you'd expect, as well: they can be affixed to a page in a book, magazine, or other collection of papers, temporarily marking that page so you can return to it quickly.In my testing of this admittedly-simple application, I found that the adhesive appears to be a little weaker than the competingPost-it Page Markers, 0.5-Inch x 2 Inches, Assorted Bright Colors, 500 per Pack (670-5AF2)product. I love these little page markers. I love the post-it page flags because they don't tear. These page markers remain on the pages where I placed them even after I carry my books with me around all day long. Well, I can still do that plus now I have these to stick on the page, so that it's not a total hunt and search for the page. Plus if the page slips shut, I can find it right away. When I received the brightly colored Avery page markers I could not wait to begin to use them. They can be easy to tear so you can not be too rough on the page marker. These little sticky page markers from Avery are working quite well for me to mark the pages of my recipe books at my favorite recipes and recipes I want to try. I've found that they can be re-positioned on a smooth page, but a more textured one doesn't allow for moving the markers. They are somewhat lightweight and so not meant to be semi-permanent page markers. I love these page markers...they are so much easier to use and more convenient than trying to cut strips from a regular Post-it note. I especially like these Avery page markers because the colors are so nice and bright. I like that these page markers are slightly wider than the ones I have been able to find in the past; also, the colors are nice and bright and the paper quality is great. I don't usually use page markers but after receiving this realized how useful these can be! I can easily mark a page and go back to it. Most of the other page markers (arrows, sign here labels, etc.) Now I would love it if Avery would make the page markers with a point at one end like an arrow.One note: because they are paper, they are not quite as durable as the plastic labels in terms of general handling and folding over, especially if you stick them so that part of it sticks beyond the edge of your book, etc., but you get 250 of them for the same price as 100 of the plastic kind *and* you can recycle them.
