Can be used as a folder or as a file.Minuses:  No holes for putting it into a three-ring binder. I wasn't really crazy about this folder. They are not your normal manila folder. Each folder has a built-in, large (1/3 cut) tab at the top. The folder itself is a thick, durable folder with a textured glossy finish. Each folder has a flap at the top that lowers over documents for a secure hold. First, the folder is made of a laminated paper that isn't especially thick. It was a little too bright and shiny--while the folder is dark blue, it's a bright dark blue, if that makes sense, and it makes it look cheap.The fold down flap in the center that is supposed to help "lock" papers in place is rather flimsy. You can keep it open fairly easily, and as soon as you close the folder, the top tab folds down.Highly recommended for projects that need to go straight from the file cabinet to the presentation, and then straight back to the file cabinet. Each folder has an extra large tab, and a flap at the top which prevents papers from slipping out. You can use them as a two-pocket folder to carry papers to classes or meetings. The folder can then be stored in a filing cabinet or open-top container by flipping the folder on its side. The folder also has a fold down tab at the top to hold papers upright in the pockets.They are definitely not sturdy, but I wouldn't quite call them flimsy. Depending on what you need to include, this folder could be an easy way to finish off your  materials in a professional manner.
