The HP Officejet Pro X451dn Wireless is a sharp looking printer weighing 38 pounds with a footprint of 26 x 26 x 15 extended. This is a single-function printer. The printer is ready to go immediately after hitting the "on" button (unlike my present HP printer which takes nearly 5 minutes to warm up). This printer has a 500-sheet tray and printing volume of 500-2800 pages per month with an upper limit of upto 50,000 pages per month. I am hopeful to know that the printer supposedly prints just over 9,000 pages per black  XL cartridge and over 6,000 per XL color cartridge! I am fortunate and pleased to be offered this printer through Vine; my intended use is to give it rigorous testing alongside my sister and her kids who will use this through school assignments and the normal running of a teenage household with various mobile, desk, laptop and household demands. So I'll say, I recommend this printer for use at home or in a small office needing a simple single-function printer as a back up for a full functioning printer. This printer is 4 stars for you if you need this narrow approach; it is not so good if you occasionally need to scan and fax. This is strictly a printer, no scanner or copier.But. I don't know yet how ink-efficient the printer is, but hopefully it will be as good as it claims - the cartridges are around one hundred bucks a piece.This printer is probably a little too much for home use but would be good for a small office with light needs. This printer just works every time, and that is about the best you can say for any electronic product.The colors are vibrant, it is fast, and the operation works smoothly. It is a larger than normal printer, but if you have a printer stand, it will fit on it. This printer is a wireless printer - it is not set up for WiFi connectivity and as such it requires a wired connection, either to an individual system, an Ethernet wall port or a direct connection to a switch or router. This is the wrong printer to buy if you want it connected to a WiFi network and want to move it around without connecting to an Ethernet port somewhere.Setup was easy but it took a long time. Once the printer was unpacked I followed the directions that came with it for installing the ink cartridges and loading paper. First, this is a really quiet printer. I have never had a printer that operates so quietly when printing. If you need a quiet printer that does not wake the whole office when it prints, this is a good printer.Second, I found that the print quality is phenomenal. It is a solid printer that prints fast and generates very high-quality output, and it does this very quietly compared to most other printers.
