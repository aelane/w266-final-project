If the protectors only had one sheet inside they even provided modest protection against spills from above (I used paper towel so I could see the wicking more easily). Furthermore the non-glare protectors also resist fingerprints which means your reports stay nicer longer. Cheap non-glare protectors are textured and very cloudy. These non-glare protectors are a good weight and I haven't had one split or fail with use yet. These non-glare protectors are my favorite.Pros:+Easy to open!+Holds at about 4 sheets easily without changing shape;+Doesn't get creased, bent or tear with normal use.+Clear presentation;+As of today's writing price it sells for $14.99 and offers free shipping, if you place an order with a combined total of $35.00 of Amazon Qualified Purchases.Cons:-Fails to hold as many sheets as Clear Version of Wilson Jones Heavy Weight Top-Loading Sheet Protectors, Clear 100/Box -it tends to warp with 5 or more pages (these failed to hold the 8 -10 sheets I could fit in the Wilson Jones clear version) -perhaps, a result of manufacturing defect, perhaps machines need to be re-calibrated?-Price is a bit higher in some cases to competitors such as Avery's brand (but recent reviews state the Avery product quality is poor), so perhaps you get what you pay for?Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't carry Office Depot's 2.4 100 count Sheet Non-Glare Protector, I went to Office Depot's website -Their Comparable Item #498761 Office Depot Brand Top-Loading Sheet Protectors, Standard Weight, Non-Glare, Box Of 100, as of today's current online price is $12.79 plus shipping. They seem as thick as my other protectors. I have encountered protectors so thin they are like saran wrap, so maybe that's what they mean by heavy weight. I have had sheet protectors that are difficult to load. I use sheet protectors a lot- for everything from my knitting patterns to recipes. The protectors are easy to open, once I pinch and rub a bit to break up the static cling. I have bought cheaper protectors, only to have them wrinkle, split and/or tear at the holes. I use page protectors a ton in our homeschooling and these are well-made and have held up with lots of flipping around and handling by kids.

HOWEVER, the clear protectors had a large number of fingerprint smudges, these smudges were not present on the non-glare sheet protector.
