These tabs are super easy to use. These tabs STAY PUT!! These tabs are well-made and I really like the 1/3 cut size! I won't go back to those smaller tabs again! They came with plastic tabs with spikes at both ends that hook into two slots inside the folder. They are thick and sturdy - much more so than those flimsy tabs with spikes. "East Slide" implies that these tabs slide back and forth horizontally for easy re-arrangement of the tabs in alphabetical order. Once the tabs click into place, they don't slide horizontally at all. There are eighteen tabs in a pack and white inserts are included. These are pretty great little tabs. I strongly dislike those tabs that you have to insert into slots. Those flimsy little tabs that I have always used can fall off. Smead Easy Slide Tabs: These tabs are amazing. I like that these tabs are sturdy, not flimsy like so many others, and go on your hanging folders without any struggle or problems.Another great product from Smead to make your filing that much easier. These are the absolute best tabs that I have used, and over the years, I have used quite a few.They are clear, which makes them highly visible in my file cabinet. These tabs are good quality and sturdy. One of these tabs is about the size of 1  of the regular sized tabs. These tabs work with any hanging file folder. This tabs are very nice and easy to use. These tabs are unlike the others that require fitting into place one side at a time. But you have to recycle tabs because over time the names of files change.This product is perfect for situations where the file folder name can change a few times over the life cycle of the actual file folder. Traditional tabs have to be inserted into the slot on the hanging folder and many times end up tearing the slot. These tabs easily affix to a hanging folder without the need to insert the ends of the tab into the slots on the hanging folder. The tabs are sturdier than traditional tabs since they don't need to be flexible enough to allow them to end and insert into the hanging folder slots. These are great, easy-to-use tabs that are good for both home or office use. Unlike other tabs that I've had to bend on one side to fit into those small spaces at the top of a folder, these really do slide in nicely. Highly recommended if you need tabs. It's not miserable or destructive to remove them, but they do seem to hold pretty securely, though you wouldn't want to be pulling them out by the tabs or anything--but you wouldn't do that with the other type, either. I never have enough tabs to go with my hanging file folders. These are the best tabs ever made for folders. I never gave it much thought to the tabs on folders, and like most people, now wonder why weren't these invented sooner. Further, because these tabs "clamp" to the top edge of your file folder, you can position the tab where it is most visible. The tabs are much easier to position than the tabs which must be inserted into slots; this is a big plus for those whose hands are not as nimble as they once were. These tabs go into standard hanging file folders and are extremely sturdy and wider than the average tab inserts.The gimmick here is the fact that instead of sliding into the grooves of a standard hanging folder, these are held in place with small teeth making it "relatively" easily to slide into new position. There is really not much that I can say about these tabs - they are well made, useful, and, as the name suggests, easy to use. SMEAD EASY-SLIDE FILE TAB.These tabs are amazing. I loved these tabs. They are longer than most tabs, so easy to position/re-position, and much sturdier and larger than the usual ones. These tabs are thick and sturdy! I never realized tabs like this existed and find them wonderful.I love that they "clip" on to hanging folders and you can position them anywhere on the folder. My tabs for home filing are all hand-me-downs from work--you know the type, the ones you awkwardly stick to your file folders and hope they don't bend over and make you panic you lost the social security folder. These tabs got me to sit down and happily organize all our important documents and that's a big deal. Love these EAsy Slide tabs. Smead Easy Slide TabThese tabs are designed with small indents that squeeze into certain hanging folders. The write-on tabs stay secure inside each plastic tab, which is something I was initially concerned about. I've had write-on tabs on other products that would never stay put. Smead Easy Slide Tab 1/3-Cut are larger than the usual tabs included with hanging file folders, making them easier to read and less of a pain to write more than a short word on. These tabs are huge. To slide the tabs along the top of the files, you have to bend the plastic back a bit, breaking the indents from their hold. Then the tabs slide back and forth as promised. You get 1/3 cut plastic tabs that are thick and durable. The tabs are a full 3.5 inches long so you can write a long label or write in big letters on your tab. Although the tabs that typically come with folders work fine, these are made of a thicker plastic and really do go on and come off easier than the tabs that attach with wings. Once attached, they stay on much better than the standard tabs. These are nice tabs for hanging folders. The tabs are 3.5" wide - a bit wider than the ones I usually use. This works great and actually makes it easier to arrange the tabs in a staggered manner so that each does not block the one behind it. However, these tabs are not inserted at all. Instead of having to slip hanging folder tabs into the slots and relocating for readability every time you start to add or rearrange your your files, these tabs slide on easily and move back and forth with enough tension to keep them in place on their own but enough give to allow them to move with a simple push.A great idea that makes organizing and filing so much easier. HIGHLY recommended if you need tabs, especially if you've got a drawer full of tabs that have fallen off and are sitting on the bottom. No more tabs hiding behind other tabs because you changed the file organization but didn't want to futz with the tab pockets! I am just very tickled with this tabs, they are so sturdy, and so handy, I will  never by the flimsy easy to lose ones again!God Bless ~Amy I finally dove in and found these tabs to easy to use, and may be the best file labeling system for personal or small business use. The tabs are sturdy and have large insert cards to easily identify each file.These file labels are very easy to attach to any size file folder and are easy to move as needed. If you find it very difficult to install traditional tabs, these are a slam dunk. These tabs are very firm and stiff / sturdy, and you don't have to be worried about them falling off if you brush up against the file folder other brands tend to do. If you are looking for sturdy tabs, I would recommend these. If you change your tabs on your hanging folders frequently these are a solution to your problem. If you do this and you know you do it, you'd probably be happy to try out these tabs. Holds 18 tabs in a non resealable or reusable bag. They are actually easier to use than the tabs that are reliant on slots.These tabs hold onto my hanging folders well. These work a little different than some tabs, and they are more robustly built than more than a few I've used lately. These tabs are sturdy & longer  which enables me to write larger or add more info on the tab.The reason for the 4 star is that the 1st tab out of the package had the 3 notches, which I mentioned above, on the top rather than the bottom, which obscured my writing somewhat. These revolutionary tabs simply slip over the top edge. The tabs are easier to move than the old fashioned type that slip into the notches.When I started using these at work, I got so excited by this novel product I had to immediately share the news with my boss and co-workers. If you needed NEW tabs, they would be very nice. There's really not much to say about folder tabs but these are super easy to use. Inserting the tabs is annoying and they never seem to end up where I want them. These tabs are great. I like these tabs because they are larger than the tabs that come with most hanging file, allowing you to write more or larger on the label. These tabs are stiff and sturdy. These tabs are not angled back at all, but come straight out from the folders and are difficult to read unless the files are more at eye level. The tabs stay nice and snug on the folders, without coming off and won't break easily because they are so sturdy, but they won't meet my needs. Also, the tabs used to fall off my folders all the time. The tabs hold snugly on the hanging folders and do not fall off. Furthermore, it is easy to slide these tabs on the folders so that the tabs can be staggered and easily viewed. Also the tabs you get free are small. These Smead Easy Slide tabs are just what I needed to replace some of the worn out ones and those that have fallen off.T
