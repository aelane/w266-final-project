Overall, I cannot recommend this product, particularly at what I consider to be a very high price for a glorified plastic binder. I felt confused by the product description, didn't really have a sense of how expansive this organization system would be. I've read & re-read this product's description and have taken the inserts in & out of the binder. When I saw this product I just had to have it. Unfortunately this product is one of those that sounds good on paper, but fails in reality.The folder itself is large, about 2 inches in width. It is hard to imagine this product having much utility because it tries to fill too many needs and does most of them poorly. This is a very useful product if you have a lot of odds and ends you use in your business or school. This is a decent product. Overall a worthy product to add a little organization in a busy life. I am not overly impressed with this product. This product meets the needs of kids working on a project when they need to keep track of index cards, CD's, articles, work in progress papers, and more. This is a very nicely put together product and it's well made. Let me first say, this product is NOT worth $30 by any means. I like this product because it enables me to carry several documents neatly while keeping them in good condition. The product design permits easy insertion or removal of any or all of the component parts, which consist of two secure file folders, a plastic clipboard, a media file, and a page that includes a large envelope, a small envelope, and a letter opener. This product was most useful in assembling a batch of papers that was needed for various business appointments in a number of locations. I actually chose this product for my daughter to use for when she has special projects at school and needs to bring the materials back and forth a lot. Overall, a nice product that seems like it's going to hold up well.
