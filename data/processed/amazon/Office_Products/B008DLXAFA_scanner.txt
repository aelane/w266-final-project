The scanner market is pretty full of options and I recommend opting out of this model.The scanner was difficult to set up. No other scanner company has a three year. I am very happy with this scanner....i only gave it 4 stars because i dont think it is a little bulky and heavy to be "portable" as it claims. Putting this scanner through its paces had more ups and downs than a roller coaster at Cedar Point. This is fine, but it means you have to sit there and watch your scanner and the i940 is not particularly fast. This scanner is just ok. It feels like Kodak is new to the scanner business and doesn't quite have it all worked out. Not a terrible scanner, but nothing special either. Now with this ScanMate scanner I can do both.The scanner itself couldn't have been easier to set up. To turn on the scanner you simply pop open the cover on it - and the cover becomes the input tray for the scanner. Once the scanner has scanned the pages, you get a pop-up box on the computer screen. The scanner comes with some business card management software - which I did not install. Though Kodak claims it is a mobile scanner, and in a sense it is, I am not sure I would want this scanner in my carrier on.The build quality of the scanner has a very solid feel. I can only label this scanner as a hybrid between a truly portable scanner and a dedicated desktop scanner. With this scanner, no such customizations.The unit points out that you can run it by "USB ONLY" when out & about, but you have to use a second USB port for the power. If you want an all around good scanner that may be slower but more flexible, I'd probably still stick with the Fujitsu S1300i.
