Just tear off the note at the preferation and off you go with no sticky product. Each sticky note is perforated making it easy to tear off the note. However I find it is just as easy to just fold the note over. When I want to take the note off, I just, you know, peel it off. You just tore off your note; now you have a place marker that doesn't even stick out of the book to remind you it's there, and you sure aren't going to want to scribble tiny little notes on the half note left stuck there.So, the question with these really became: "when am I going to want to leave a tiny strip of sticky paper somewhere?" What do you do when you write a note and then have to take with you? With Avery Perforated Sticky Notes, I can write a note and then take it and go - no fuss and more importantly, no muss. I'm always using my sticky note pads as scratch pads, and when I stick them in my purse to go shopping they tend to stick everywhere.

You can write on the whole note or just the bottom half (and save the top half for later).

And, if all I want is a little note for my pocket, I can use a bit of scrap paper for that.You do have to give this product points for convenience, but minus about 1/2 star for the bit of waste each time you tear.All in all, a good product.

You can place the note somewhere prominent and then simply take it with you when the time arrives.
