Handy size for papers, knick knacks, books, etc. The size is excellent. The larger size is slightly uncomfortable to carry when full of heavy stuff.To all of the haters who don't like the price... boxes aren't free. Due to the large size, using these for books or DVD's would be far too much for the average person to lift as the weight of those objects adds up pretty quickly. Legal size file storage even has a little extra room, so it's even possible to store manila file folders nestled inside Pendaflex folders. They are sturdy and the size is very nice--it holds plenty without becoming too heavy. ).This small size is perfect for books, CD's, DVD's and I think they are perfect for smaller, breakable goods and collectibles (with plenty of bubblewrap and newspaper). Nice, well made, good size, exactly as they are describedExcellent for moving, storage, supplies, toys and multi purposeyou can decorate w/ paint or collage to store 'stuff' outta the way...if you do a good enough artwork job, you can even keep them out in open in a game room , bedroom etc.You can't go wrongBetter , in my opinion, than the boxes sold at UHaul They are a good size too, so you don't overload and end up with back breaking heavy boxes that you can't carry. I intend to buy more of this size as it holds quite a bit and isn't too big for me to handle alone. the really large size box is great for clothes or toys, anything heavy in here and you'll be tempted to fill it up and eventually you won't be able to move the boxes.they fold down nice and easy and flat for storage. Easy to assemble and a perfect size for our storage problems. I have enough of this size for now but will be purchasing additional boxes of this brand for other purposes. The size was also good because it keeps the box from getting too heavy with overpacking." And if you wish to jump up in size a bit from the smaller boxes you'll gain 4" in the Height and 4" in the Depth and also gain an extra 8" in overall length.- However, one still has to make sure and not do something crazy like try to stack the boxes (full of books) ten high. The size is great for lots of items but probably not books or paper. The large size holds a lot of items - I was able to pack some bulky brass and glass items securely without worry of clanging, banging or breaking. They are the perfect size for pillows, clothing, bed sheets, towels and will accomodate loosely packed electronics or sports equipment. This size would be good for mixed use, maybe some heavy stuff, but I wouldn't fill it with books or the like unless you also taped the bottom. I also loaded the smaller size box with heavy books. The smaller size also allows your library to be more organized upon arrival. (from large size review)These boxes are very easy to put together and don't require tape unless you are going to be moving them around a lot, then they may open up during handling, but for quick moves they will be fine not taped.I'm one that usually would go for the "free" boxes you get at grocery stores and you can sometimes get heavier ones, so for a big move I would probably save the expensive fancy ones for my special items or bulky, hard to fit items that are not heavy. They are the perfect size for my Rubbermaid shelvingRubbermaid 7086 72-Inch Five-Shelf Shelving Unit-- the shelves are 18" deep; the boxes are 16" deep. They held up very well and are ready to be used again.If I were moving, I would get the larger size of these boxes. ), and basically the right size for emptying out file drawers. These are just the right size. The standard size makes it easy to load or store safely with excellent structural integrity. This size is a big but comfortable "medium" at 18" x 18" x 16" and I believe if you can handle lifting the weight you put into it, the box will have no security issues holding the contents.I am not moving, but have so much decor, be it seasonal, and mostly Christmas items etc. Same size, easy to use boxes store and stack safely and easily. I was pleasantly surprised at the size, ease, and versatility of these boxes.The pros:-It requires no packing tape, which definitely reduces the time and effort involved in using these boxes. They are very sturdy and easy to stack since you can get all the same size. Perfect size to lift. This "small" size isn't very convenient, though; unless you're storing/moving a few tiny things, go for something bigger. This large size is great for clothing and bedding, but these items quickly become heavy, and weight is an issue. I prefer the small and medium size boxes as you can fill them completely without the weight problem. Since you'll probably be getting all of them in the same size, they're even easier to stack, maximizing space in a storage area or truck. I took this size intending to box some stuff up in orderly fashion and put them in my closets. It turns out I probably should've gotten the smaller size, due to my not knowing the size of my closets when I placed the order from work (that's my fault). They're pretty big, I couldn't really imagine getting the large size unless you have something really big.
