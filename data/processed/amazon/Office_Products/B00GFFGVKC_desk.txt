I wanted this desk lamp for my office since the flourescent lights are harsher than harsh.Its a nice lamp that makes sure there is no glare on any of my documents or files. I like this desk light. Plus it also looks very nice on my desk without taking a whole lot of space. It would be good for a desk or workshop. 3M's LED desk lamp has an attractive modern design. When I put this on her desk and turned it on, I knew I'd never get it back! I've been using various LED desk lights for years. However, LED desk lights generally aren't as powerfully bright.My thoughts on this 3M lamp:-Nice glossy modern finish with faux-metal accents. If you have a large desk or are doing highly-detailed work, you will want additional lumens.-The color temp is a typical LED cool-white which is my preference for all areas of the house. That is really important when it is sitting on my desk, because it is something I see all day long. When I got this 3M Polarizing LED Desk Lamp, I knew I had found my perfect desk lamp solution.First, the lamp itself has a nice stable based so it certainly won't tip over. I really wanted to love this desk lamp, but unfortunately for me it has a couple of flaws. Unless you sit at a desk with a book directly under the light, it just isn't bright enough for me. I like that this desk lamp greatly reduces the harsh glare that is common in desk lamps. Glare must be more prevalent than I think.The lamp currently resides on the desk where much work gets done in our household. I use this desk lamp for reading, crocheting, and working on my crafts. This desk lamp is contemporary and sleek.
