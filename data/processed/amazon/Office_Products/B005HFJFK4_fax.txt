The fax machine functions are very easy to setup and operate, and the quality of scans and copies are exceptional.A unique feature that i had not come across in other printers, although somewhat gimmicky, is the coloring page maker which allows to make coloring sheets out of photos or other images. The fax function was simple and easy to use, no different than your common fax machine.Photo Quality - Higher than expected. Since I have a fax line connected to the Canon I decided not to hook up the telephone line or the fax features. I have used the fax option very well and it even faxed a colored transcript well. I was able to print, scan and fax with no trouble from my Mac and Windows machine and my iPad.The printer paper is easy to load and can hold both photo and regular paper at the same time (no need to take one out to put in the other). The fax machine works just like a fax machine should. I didn't bother to try out the fax because documents are so easily scanned and emailed and I don't know anyone who prefers to receive faxes instead of emailed attachments these days. I tried just one fax (sent one and received one), it works as expected. To test it, I set up and used the fax feature. We have not used the fax function since none of us has sent a fax since 1998. You can print, fax (including document feeder), and scan/copy (flat-bed or feeder).
