This printer not only prints beautifully, it was a breeze to install and get up and running. While the Brother has been a dependable printer, this Samsung is much faster with not only printing, but also warmup. Once I installed the printer on my iMac and added it to my Wifi network, it was available to my iPad without doing anything on the iPad. When I initially used the printer with its NFC, I tapped my LG Optimus F6 running android to the NFC sticker and it automatically took me to the Google Play Store to download the Samsung Mobile app. The Samsung Wireless Monochrome printer is amazing. I wanted a printer that I could use to print from my iPad. I just got this printer and I really do like it. This is a great printer with good quality output. Very fast monochrome printer. Sometimes the printer gets 'stuck' coming out of sleep and I have to manually 'wake it up' via one of the buttons. This is a very good printer. We are using this printer for home office or small usage. The printer also comes with a USB cable - a rarity in printers these days. Connect the printer to a computer (Windows/Mac) and use the CD to install the software tool. to connect to the printer. Overall, a really compact, easy to set-up printer. My daily printer has been a Brother laser printer, so I was interested in how the Samsung would compare. The printer is compact, which is nice for small desks or a small shelf where it doesn't take up too much room. The printer is relatively easy to setup and get going. Overall a good printer for the cost. I am really impressed with this printer. I use my printer all day and this is a bit of an annoyance, but not that big of a deal. I am really happy with this printer. Unfortunately, the Eco Driver doesn't work on Mac computers.This new Samsung printer (BLI Lab "Outstanding Achievement Award" winner, 2013) clearly stands out as one of the best printers I've ever had--it's just unfortunate that I cannot use the Easy Eco Driver on my Mac.
