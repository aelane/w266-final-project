Run the roller down onto a piece of paper, or just put a dot or two on whatever you need to adher.One tip is if you have pictures, school projects, notices, reminders for the refrigerator, just touch the back with a dot or two and ... quick as a jumping bean, you have it on the refrigerator. The roller makes it easy to dispense and the size of the adhesive dots are perfect for card-making (and scrapbooking too). It's easy to use; you just press the roller down. I have been using Scotch adhesive roller products for quite a while and the ease of using it and no mess is a joy. With this roller, you can reach areas that may be out of the reach of other types of adhesive, while avoiding the mess common with liquid adhesives.This adhesive dot roller is simple enough to use. The roller on the tip will not touch the paper and no adhesive will release. The roller dispenses a sticky trail of pale blue dots on to the surface. I used this adhesive roller tape a lot for gluing papers, gift wrappers, stamps, envelopes, photos, and many other different types and thickness of paper sheets. The dot-patterned adhesive roller tape comes handy when I glued curved or circular shaped paper cutouts as the tape can simply follow the shape of the cutout/paper as I roll it over the paper surface.The result of using this tape is clearly visible:1. The roller is convenient to handle and use. Other roller adhesives I have used have missed areas with the glue and left strings of glue all over the place. I love the Scotch roller adhesive dot roller......What a fresh new idea and it works just like the video on the product page! Dot roller dot roller dot roller... oh how I love you so!I absolutely love this product as it is easy to use and produces great results. The roller is quite convenient to use, there is a little hinged door to cover the adhesive when not in use, then you open it and roll on the surface to be glued. It is still good to use the roller for regular flat applications, though. I've always wanted to try a dot roller to replace glue or tape for projects that require a light adhesive, and for the most part the dot roller works pretty well. Careful, they can go through an entire roller in one sitting if you don't manager it. I also found Scotch's Dot roller to be easier to load.

All you have to do is hold the roller at a 45-degree angle and push firmly onto the paper of your choice. The roller leaves small adhesive dots behind, allowing you to stick two light weight papers together. The roller is refillable, so you don't have keep having to throw plastic away when it runs out.

I'm very impressed with this little adhesive roller. It does.The dot roller is easier to use and neater than a gluestick. This little roller leaves a clear strip of adhesive with reliable results.

Therefore, if I put this roller in a drawer or craft box (or God forbid my pocket or purse), the exposed adhesive strip is going to pick up dust and debris, causing problems the next time I use it.

Works just like a white out roller only it applies dots of adhesive instead of a strip.Sweet little tool!

This "dot roller" puts out a strip of sticky flat dots rather than one simple ribbon of double-stick tape.
