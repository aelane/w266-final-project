They come in three colors. The assorted colors also help with color coding your files. The assorted colors add an additional help in organization, not to mention that the colors look more attractive. The bright colors make filing by category easy and I like the 1/3 cut tabs for labels. They are pleasing colors, too. The colors are great and the fasteners are fine.... but the actual folder is a little on the thin side and is a bit flimsy. The colors are bright and actually pretty, and the folders are sturdy enough without being bulky.Once again, Smead provides an invaluable paper product. The Smead Fastener Folders come in easily discernible, assorted colors, and with two sets of fasteners. Having different colors makes organization easier as opposed to looking through a pile of manilla folders, you can categorize what you are filing. I love the colors, nice, thick and sturdy, the prongs are great, make fastening documents very easy. The great vibrant colors will also perk up your work area, be it home or away! Bright colors for easy distinction; strong fasteners; fasteners on right and left interior sides; pre-creased for clean folds; and light to mid weight stock. What I especially like are the colors -12 folders in each color (red, blue, yellow & green). I love the different colors, allowing me to instantly grab what I want, without necessarily having to read the tab. I have the assorted colors, which comes with yellow, red, green & blue (sure wish they would have put in some lavender). The different colors can be used to track individual family members documents as well.

colors will be either distracting or useful, depending on your organizational needs.I'm not going to invest in a dedicated two hole punch, as I have several adjustable three-holes.

And, I like the bright colors.

the varied colors can be used to separate out different projects or patients ...  personally, i like one color a folder for each type of project ... then again, i like a christmas tree with all white lights but many folks like multi-colored lights.
