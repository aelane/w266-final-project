This printer was very easy to set up, and the size is very convenient. This printer is pretty quiet, a bit louder when it is scanning - but since it can scan wirelessly? )So far so good for this printer - should anything change - I will update this review. I think this printer is good for the average home user who is NOT planning to use it for printers.Installation was easy. I'm glad it's not the printer we use at work. This printer was easy to set up right out of the box. This is a great printer that is easy to setup, and runs easily with the push of a button where you can scan, make photocopies, and scan files to make digital for your computer. This is one printer worth the money and the effort.Price: B+Convience & Quality: A-Overall: B+ I needed a printer scanner as I destroyed my last one. The DJ2540 is a good printer. It's a basic printer, but does everything I expect from a printer. Installing the printer on my laptop was also easy.I was able to print from 2 different android phones with this printer (one running ICS and another running Jelly Bean). However, you can't just install the printer on the phone and print anything, like websites or email, for example -- it does not integrate like that. This printer is good for printing occasional documents.I'm not sure how long the ink cartridges will last or if they are cost effective. This printer is best for simple jobs I highly recommend it for students and home projects. This printer looks (and feels) more expensive and of a higher quality than the list price here on Amazon would suggest. My older printer started having fits just about a week before I was going to have to print some important papers, and I found this printer on Amazon and ordered it. This is a rather inexpensive printer, copier and scanner with wireless capability enabling printing from smart phones and tablets.

The HP Deskjet 2540 is a small, easy-to-use printer that works fine for occasional users, like me.

The printer is slow, but that is fine for my printing needs.The scanner makes a fan noise every time you scan a document, but it's easy to use and includes a number of settings, such as resolution and size, depending on what type of document you're scanning.

This printer is very easy to setup, install, connect and prepare for use.PROS:Printing is easy.Copying is easy.Scanning is easy and provides very good quality.Scanning has a LOT of options (scan document or photo to a file, an email or a TIF).It can operate by direct connection to the computer using the supplied USB cord, or cordless.It is extremely lightweight (and therefore easy to move).It has a relatively small footprint.It is fairly fast.CONS:Print quality is not the best (there tends to be a little grey in the white areas).It is a little loud.Overall, the printer is a fairly good buy for the price.
