I think these scissors are a great product. These scissors are definitely not for general duty purpose. Nicely made basic scissors of this type. These are special scissors that are designed to cut off bandages / atheletic tape. The scissors themselves are coated in some kind of non-stick material, and tape, etc, do not stick to it as much as say a normal pair of stainless scissors. Good scissors for bandages!! We have bandage scissors in every first aid kit; these are the best pair by a wide margin. As a CVT, I use bandage scissors all the time, and there's a market for these among vets and techs. These are awkward, and not noticeably better that regular scissors for household use. These 7&#34; scissors are just about like the ones the doctors and hospitals use. I am very happy to have these scissors and will get a lot of use from using these scissors. These are good scissors for cutting bandages etc.

These scissors are billed as useful for medical personnel.

The scissors worked beautifully on the tape.The scissors' off-set handle made cutting all three items easy when they are close to a body part (such as a leg).

The scissors' handle is not padded, but it is pretty comfortable.
