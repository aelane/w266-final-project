This board and its little brotherExpo Biggest Loser Daily Meal Planner Magnetic Dry Erase White Board (1770993)are attractive, well made, but basic daily charts for diet and exercise. And the board comes with a marker and eraser.I see some reviewers saying that anyone could buy a whiteboard for less money (or use an app or make a word doc) and make their own exercise chart. This white board comes in pretty handy as a weight loss tool. This board allows me to log cross training activities like weights, Yoga and swimming.It is a large board, and will catch your eye with the bright blue and yellow graphics. The board is surrounded in a sturdy silver frame. This board helps planning and following the Biggest Loser exercise plan, or even your own exercise plan. The board itself is nicely designed and has a metal framed edge. It is a nice board to plot all of your exercise and goals in one place. Kind of like a running total board you see all the time with a thermometer type of gauge on it. This white board seems like a great idea to track exercise. I understand that there is another BL white board to track the eating part, but I don't think many people will be willing to hang two heavy white boards in their house. To me, this board almost seems more concerned with advertising of the show instead of being an efficient, practical white board. It is a white board and it is an exercise tool.As a white board, it is actually really nice. The board is framed in aluminum and is quite solid. When the board is mounted on the wall (provided the mounting brackets are solidly mounted to the wall), I have no fears that it is going to fall off like many cheaper mounting systems I have seen on other boards. The board writes and erases well. I don't think the board is the tool for me, but it very well could be the ultimate answer for the next person. I got this white board and placed it in my kitchen where I won't forget about it. I only wish this board had a place to track food intake instead of three exercise routines (cardio, weight training, stationary machines like a bike, etc...)  I could track all of those using one section instead of three. I use this board to track not what I plan to do but what I've done each day of the week and my overall weight loss.It has three main columns to track what kind of exercise you are doing (cardio, circuit etc.) Now honestly it is just a very large white erasable board to chart your exercises ( or highlight your lack thereof)  It is solid and it is a bit BIG. The board was slightly bumped up too. This board is superb if this is what you need to motivate you! What I don't like about the board is that it doesn't yank me out of bed in the morning and make me exercise. The board is exactly what it claims to be and how described in the picture and description. The board that I got had a big dent in the middle. The board cleans up easily with a damp paper towel but I am using a whiteboard eraser I already had.All hardware for mounting included.Like most plans for weight loss...if actually applied it will work... and this is another tool which may help one toward achieving that goal. You can place this board on your refrigerator to serve you as a daily reminder of your exercise. This board could be a useful tool for the workout fanatic. I personally didn't find this board to be that helpful. This board is very large, so unless you have an exercise room or don't mind taking up wall space in your regular living space, you will find it difficult to find a place for it.

This is an awfully big, big board, and it's laid out in such a way that you can only keep track of one week's exercise at a time.

I was hoping for a board that I could list my exercise schedule each week.

The board is separated into the days of the week and 3 sections of type of workout.However, you can also utilize the board in other ways.
