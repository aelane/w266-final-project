These Sticky Notes come in  blue, pink, yellow, and green. These Sticky Notes are great for leaving notes anywhere. The Avery Sticky Notes are ever so slightly smaller in length than the Post-Its (millimeters), but this is not enough to affect your use or decision on which product to purchase.Ultimately, when making a decision on which product to purchase, the Avery Sticky Notes are comparable and worth considering. They're Sticky Notes! Avery Sticky Notes are my first choice for reminders for three reasons:1) They *stick* where I put them -- and can be moved and stuck again, when I do something stewid and cover my CD controls.2) They remain *stuck* until I remove them.3) They don't leave any Sticky Stuff behind them -- even on paper! I also use Sticky Notes to mark pages in books. I use Sticky Notes over and over as reminders for standing appointments. I'll stick with Post-it Notes. **** Edited 7-22-11  I initially was pleased with these Sticky Notes, until summer arrived. First off, the Sticky Notes are just a bit smaller in size , not quite as long from top to bottom. The comparable one will bePost-it Notes, Original Pad, 3 Inches x 3 Inches, Recycled, Assorted Pastel, 75 Sheets per Pad, Six Pads per Pack (5416-RP-AP)orPost-it Original Notes, 3 x 3 Inches, Canary Yellow, 100-Sheet Pads (12 Pads per Pack) (654-YW). I put a few Avery Sticky Notes in every room, so I can write a quick note and pick it up later when I actually have the time to perform the task.
