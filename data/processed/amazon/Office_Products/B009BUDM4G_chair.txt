This is an awesome chair. This is probably the most luxurious 'office-style' chair I've ever felt. Ok when I first got the chair and unboxed everything I was not impressed. My everyday chair is an Aeron by Herman Miller and I would have no trouble with this chair on a daily basis. He saw this chair and he went into full hunt and desroy mode. Moved the chair into another room where he couldnt get at it. The only negative I can list about this chair is the assembly. Let's just say it wasn't as easy as another (though much more expensive) Hon chair I've had to assemble.Otherwise, the cost is not too much for a genuine leather chair. This chair is made of pretty nice quality leather material. This chair was easy to assemble, taking about 30 minutes for one person. The chair covering has a good feel. Overall, a good chair at this price point as long as you don't mind a deeper chair and the type of adjustments it allows. I feel that this chair will get a lot of use before the padding give out. I recommend purchasing a chair mat if you don't already have one to save wear and tear on your floors. This chair is very nice. The chair is sleek and very stylish. This chair can be adjusted for height. If I had paid for the chair, I'd return it. You really can't go wrong with this chair. If I sit in the chair for a long time (more than a couple of hours) I can actually feel the assembly that holds the seat to the post through the cushion. This chair is very nice.It replaced a rather-cheap Ikea rolling chair, which while effective, was not particularly professional looking.

I really like this chair, however my first impression was not overly positive.

Lastly, the chair casters roll easily across any surface.Overall I would highly recommend this chair, especially in the price range.

When I saw this chair in the Vine newsletter, I rejoiced and couldn't wait for it to arrive.
