I remember the first "erasable" pens. Way back in the 90's, I used erasable pens constantly for note taking and writing in college/grad school. These pens are the answer.On top of being a great pen to write with, these pens also are erasable. Most erasable pens leave horrible marks behind. These pens left me truly amazed. With some other pens I have used, I have had better erasures.The package says if the pen is heated to 140F, the ink becomes invisible but becomes visible again after cooling to 14F. First let me say that these pens write really, really well; they're thin and they never "skip" like some pens do and they also don't ooze ink like some pens do. These pens follow the typical path most erasable ink pens follow IMO...They erase fine...but the ink isn't very fluid, and it writes average.Overall a solid erasable ink pen. Well, these pens write nicely, and they erase easily without leaving a lot of eraser crumbs. These Pilot pens were purchased for use in field modifications to CAD drawings. These pens produce a fine, draftsman-grade line and dimensioning. I am rather fussy about pens, I take notes all day long and I like a good pen. If you've ever used erasable pens, you know they traditionally have not worked very well, either leaving some ink behind or leaving a hole in your paper. Prior to trying these pens, the last time I used an erasable pen was sometime in the mid-1980s. I waited so long to try them again because those erasable pens from the 80s were total crap...they SO did not erase at all! But these Pilot pens actually work! These pens are nice, for writing lists, doing crossword puzzles, and any application where it needs correcting. These pens really erase completely. I have used erasable pens in the past, and was not terribly motivated to use them, because the quality these pens were not great. Seriously, Pilot could mark these pens up double or even triple, slap a new label on the package and market them to seamstresses/quilters and make a fortune . These pens  erase better than  any pencil and eraser I have ever used.
