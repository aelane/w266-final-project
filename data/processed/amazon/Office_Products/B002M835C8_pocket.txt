The pocket tab has a flap with slits that appear for locking, but this doesn't work, if that is the intention. The pocket leaves room for the three-ring holes, and is easy to stick and un-stick (think of a big post-it note). The pocket is made with plastic. The clear pocket makes it easy to put in scrap pieces of paper and still see what's inside, better than leaving them in various places only to see them months later when you are tidying up. I always feel like I might rip the pocket trying to put the tab in place, but so far haven't.The tab part is an optional-use add on, which is handy if you want to use it. If not, just apply the pocket further in on your anchor page.For my uses, I prefer a pencil pouch w/ a zipper. The pocket itself is very nice, but I do not like that it is has adhesive only in the middle of the back panel, and the closure is a little awkward to use. Also, although the pocket is clear plastic, the contents most likely will be opaque, so keep this in mind when placing it. The pocket can hold up to a 5 x 7 1/2 inch piece of paper, which I could see using to hold a few index cards, or a CD or DVD, or I'm sure other flat items. The pocket tabs stick easily to binders, folders, or papers and remove just as easily. It is a well made pocket with a tab. I thought it was just a pocket, when I was given the opportunity to review it. I can see how you might want to temporarily attach a pocket to the inside of a file folder or pocket-less binder. So think this one through before you buy it; do you need a pocket with a tab? I used one pocket on 4 different things before deciding to stick it in my day planner and it's not peeling off or anything! I like Avery's CD-sized pocket tabs, but I'm not too crazy about this half-page variety (can't rewrite on the divider tabs, have to attach to another piece of paper, closure tabs annoying). The "pocket" is a rugged clear plastic with two tab-in-slot closures which I found difficult to refasten. This pocket is the size of a half page, is made of strong, thin plastic and closes securely with tabs. Even though it is a large pocket and could fit a cd inside, I would not recommend it for this use, as the pocket adhesive is not that sturdy for a cd's weight. Also, the PocketTab is repositionable) Finally, I found that the pocket is very secure and did not open when I shook it upside down with 60 index cards inside.My favorite element on the PocketTab is actually the tab itself. I am so glad I did because these are fantastic!Each pocket comes with a piece of paper covering a fairly wide adhesive strip on the back.
