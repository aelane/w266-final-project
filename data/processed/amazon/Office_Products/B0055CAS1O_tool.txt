This tool will cut through the infuriating anti-theft plastic packaging that so many products use these days. First let me say that I ordered this tool expecting something to open taped cardboard packages. I have been using a great tool from the world leading company Scotch, Safe Cut Package Opener.It swiftly cuts through plastic and all blister packed items. You would think a tool as old as a utility knife couldn't possibly be improved upon, but Scotch succeeds with this package opener. The tool itself is too small and difficult to hold, and I have small hands I tried it on several packages. Very excellent tool to have! This tool is so safe that you can hardly find the blade on it. The tool in itself is easy to hold in your hand and maneuver.That being said, it appears to be along the same idea of a box cutter.

This tool is simply the pointy corner edge of a razor blade.

So it should be clearer what the tool is and does.The Safe Cut Opener is meant to work on packaging tape, DVDs, shrink wrap and food bags, envelopes and mailers, and (lighter) blister pack items.Opening boxes and packaging is a common household job, and I've had my share of frustrations and disasters.

As always, you have to match the tool to the job.
