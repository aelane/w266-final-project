Once it was all set up, I was able to place and receive phone calls from anywhere in the house or outside in the yard. I lost my phone when a lighting strike and burn my unit  this was so sad I miss this phone a lot was very help full I walk around my house when I was in a call the range of the phone is great no interference at all. I will buy another phone like this soon. When he is on the Panasonic phone he can hear better then his cell,which is great...The cell phone has to stay near the base of the plug-in Panasonic to work in the house.When your on the panasonic It does Not cut off while talking as the Cell phone would do before in our home.My Husband can hear better from the Panasonic then his cell phone. Being able to choose which phone would ring was a nice option.The other option list was long, including things like naming each phone, turning voice caller ID off on each until separately, using our cell phone directory, and portability.The phone itself didn't sound amazing. I have only had the phone for a few weeks, but I don't know how I lived without it. You can use the phone handset to place a cell phone call or answer incoming cell calls, if the cell phone is near the base, or you can come home in the middle of a cell call and connect to the base, and switch to a phone handset. Check your Panasonic phone if you want to register those handsets with this phone. Panasonic blames it on the phone service supplier. This Panasonic phone has more features than anyone would want to activate in their entirety.Two of the niftiest features for many people will be how the phone can either interface with one's cell phone or with a bluetooth earpiece. All in all a great phone system.

I've got another Panasonic phone I'm happy with, but I got this one for the Link-to-Cell technology.

Not only am I very happy with this phone, but I've registered my old handsets and range extender to this base.

No other phone I've had, including another Panasonic Dect 6.0 Plus phone, could do that.Call Block is better than sliced bread.
