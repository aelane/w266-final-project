These folders are tough indeed. As long as you use the folders properly, they won't rip, unless you forcefully rip them. These folders will last. The folders are 11 3/4" wide and 9 1/2" tall. These folders should stand up decently. I had been using the regular Smead hanging folders with plastic removable tabs for years. Then the folders disappeared in plain sight. For those who desire sturdier folders with stronger tabs, they are a good buy. The folders themselves are very durable and the fact it comes in a box of 20 means you will not be running out all the time. This made them more favorable to handle.Unless you overfill your hanging folders, you'll probably only care about the new tab design. Until other folders that I have used before, these folders should last quite awhile. I was pleased with these folders because they were really thick and sturdy. All in all, these are great file folders, especially if you are like me and tend to end up with a lot of materials in a folder and need something that is sturdy enough to handle it. If you use hanging folders you know how fast they wear out. I've used these hanging folders in crates and in oddly configured file drawers and they're wonderful! How much can one say about hanging folders? The folders and the hooks are strong, and the tabs are sturdy. I've been using my Smead TUFF hanging folders in my office for about a year now. I'm pleased to say that the Smead TUFF hanging folders are still going strong - one year in.The box comes with 20 green folders, 20 plastic tabs and perforated folder labels. I ended up replacing ALL of my hanging folders with these and now I will be buying a bunch more for my work office, too. I like hanging folders. Some of my folders are the cheapest of the cheap, and some are premium folders with pretty colors, extra reinforcement, and glossy coatings. I like the high-end folders because they look and feel cool. Next to them, the cheap folders look and feel ... cheap.The Smead TUFF Hanging Folder with Easy Slide Tab does not feel cheap. Regardless, these folders feel finer, stronger, and more solid than the store brand folders I last purchased, and, with their cute "TUFF" graphics, they look nicer as well.For people who use tabs on their hanging folders, the easy slide tab could be helpful. These folders can use traditional tabs, by the way, and the easy slide tab can be purchased separately for use on other folders.These are good folders, and the easy slide tab is a nice gimmick. These folders seem very sturdy, but I'm not impressed with the sliding tabs - I found them really hard to put on & to slide around. As best I can tell comparing the Smead TUFF folders to some Sure Hook hanging folders I already own, the Smead folders feature a heavy paper stock construction along with heavier duty rod tips. The folders fit in both a 4 door file cabinet and a single drawer cabinet we purchased from Crate and Barrel.In practical use these folders do a good enough job and are likely best suited for busy offices with lots of filing needs and paperwork. These folders really are! These are sturdy folders with coated tips that make using them easier on the hands. According to Smead the folders come with `Specially reinforced channel rods" and "Coated rod tips." I rarely have had folders break on me but if that is a concern these folders look well made.I found the tabs easy to insert. These folders, being more sturdy, have a much nicer feel in the hand. They look like regular hanging folders but that's where the similarities end. I will buy these again when I need more hanging folders and recommend them. Some hanging folders buckle when I file more than a few papers in them. These folders are sturdier. These folders are extremely sturdy. These folders have better hangars and tougher paper.
