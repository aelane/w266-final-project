Quality* The files come in a very thin cardboard box, which is adequate for storage before use. Durability* The files themselves are quite strong and have inserts for labeling. Items too bulky to go into regular files were wasting precious horizontal space on shelves and in my desk drawers, but no more.Considering the price, I feel that these hanging folders could be sturdier. But the overall files seem strong enough to resist actual breakage.As long as a folder is full and closed, papers and manuals aren't likely to droop or bend, so the width of your folder is a strategic consideration. The files come with a cardboard insert that stiffens the bottom of the folder so that it will not fold when you have several files in the folder. These files work excellently for organizing those messy piles of paper into something manageable.I've been looking for a good place to fit my paper memorabilia, and with these sturdier file folders, I don't have to worry about my memories getting damaged.This product is unique because it comes with handy cardboard inserts that make the bottom of each folder straight and firm--though you'd only want to use the inserts if you have a completely full folder.I also like the assorted colors, which makes it easier to keep organized.I'm sure I'll get a lot of use out of these. The files come in a very thin cardboard box ... flimsy when held with one hand. The files are well crafted, in my opinion. I recommend hanging files made by Smead for individuals, businesses, government agencies that have any need for hanging folders. I have transferred some of our bigger files to these folders.

These files seem very sturdy and the card stock they are made of seems like they should last a long time.I prefer different colored file folders for a few reasons.

Also different colored files can prevent filing something in the wrong file by accident, which is when things get lost forever!

If you have some files with a lot of paperwork, this is the way to go.
