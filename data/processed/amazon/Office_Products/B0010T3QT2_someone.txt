If someone really really wants to intercept your mailing, they can easily come up with other ways to do that without detection. Also, if someone is extremely careful, they can easily open up the envelope without tearing it (although this would require extreme carefulness and patience). It wasn't easy, but it wouldn't take someone too long to read what was inside. They're also tamper-evident, so you'd know if someone tried to open them. If someone wishes to steal my account number, they can just steel the whole envelope and look inside. I think, that if someone really needed to open the envelope without you knowing it, then that person might have succeeded.Permanent marker does indeed bleed right through the envelope. Once sealed, if you (or someone trying to get into your mail that should not be) tries to open the envelope by lifting the sealed flap, it's perforated so it tears a little and makes it obvious that it was tampered with. Once it is sealed, that is IT until someone opens the envelope. Hence, it was evident that someone had opened it...there was NO hiding it.The envelopes have the security lining inside. You would definitely know if someone tried to open one! I could seal it back up, but someone would know without a doubt that it had been tampered with by the little tears along it. These are especially convenient for someone who does a great deal of stuffing envelopes.

As someone else said, but I will repeat if you missed it, the picture in the description is wrong!

Besides, if someone wanted to steal it, they'd steal it.

They are not designed to completely block someone from seeing through the envelope.If you use the envelope with something personal inside use another sheet of paper to help block out the personal info.I would never buy these.
