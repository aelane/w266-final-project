They're run-of-the-mill Post-its in pop-up dispensers fashioned out of paper. You can never have too many Post-its! But even that is not too difficult to do with normal, standard Post-its. I love Post-its and use them all the time. But these Post-its come in a cardboard packet which has a very sticky strip of tape on the back, designed to be attached to one's laptop. Post-its rule).P.S. Now you'll always know where your Post-its are when you need one.My only complaints about this product are 1) I don't like the idea of something leaving sticky residue all over my computer, a potential problem, and 2) when you stick the dispenser on your laptop (or other surface) it can be hard to refill the dispenser, unless you place it over an edge where you can access one of the flaps to refill it when necessary.But otherwise, a handy little office device. Post-its are great! I love Post-its; I use them at home, at work, for lists, reminders, bookmarks... I don't think I would purchase this on my own because I already have Post-its that I can carry in my purse or work bag or leave in the console of my car. You can actually buy quite a few Post-its for the price of these 3 little dispensers. Even one of these Post-its can (and should) pay for the cost of this three-pack. There's not much that's NOT fabulous about Post-its and this one is no exception. Post-its are easy to transport. Post-its were already a great idea.
