I keep a roll in three rooms of our home, so I appreciate the availability of this multi-pack, too. It is strong, and easy to handle from the roll (no splitting.) Every single roll was entirely worthless. I've always used the roll with a larger diameter, tried both the lighter weight and heavier tape with the dispenser. The roll is smaller in diameter the same width tape but not quite as long as the other. It doesn't slit and tear diagonally down the roll, leaving you scratching all along the surface of the tape to find the minuscule point to pull up again. Each roll in the package is loaded into its own disposable dispenser. Also I hate when the roll gets a tare that keeps going around and around not being able to get the whole piece back.This tape doesn't do any of that. This multiple roll package offers a great price plus no tax and free shipping. The roll of Scotch mailing tape was thick but did not adhere as well as I would have liked. I used a solid roll of this in the past two weeks when boxing up some stuff in the garage. I found the one roll to go very far (800 inches per roll) and I was easily able to tape up 6-7 large boxes. I use at least a roll of packing tape a week, so I am pretty good at using tape dispensers, this product has one major flaw, the very sharp cutting edge is not recessed, so there is nothing to protect your hands or fingers from being cut.I still have a pretty sore finger from my first attempt at using this product, so the experience is quite fresh in my mind. Each roll comes with its own holder/cutter. Before starting a roll, I remove it and flip it over, then put it back in the dispenser. Switching the roll around also helps keep the tape from reattaching to itself better this way, because the tape sticks to the teeth.
