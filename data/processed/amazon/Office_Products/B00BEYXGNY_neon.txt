Also, the neon Sharpies are not good for highlighting, specifically yellow. When these arrived, I was not sure what to expect - would they really be, "neon"? The neon collection is no exception. I love the bold neon colors! I really like the neon yellow in this pack. I was excited about getting some really bright neon markers. If you truly want neon--think permanent highlighters--or something to glow under a black light then these are the markers for you. The neon colors are well represented by the colors on the caps. These just don't scream neon to me.

The "neon" colors are bright and definitely show up when used on the right medium.

The yellow neon Sharpie is the brightest and most neon of them all, even though as soon as you write with it, it looks wet and dark.

I also compared a normal blue Sharpie to the new neon ones, it is much darker, and better to use over pencil lines.
