It's ok, but I think I can find prettier pens for the same money. I've always liked Pilot pens and this one does not disappoint! Some pens just call out to you, sing in your grasp like Excalibur to Arthur and flow across the page like an Olympic figure skater... With pens, users get what they pay for. I've enjoyed testing these Pilot pens since they clearly fill a void in the market for mid-price level writing instruments that you can carry around in jackets or briefcases. I adore pens. I've always been happy with past Pilot pens I've used, and couldn't help but give this a try.The pen comes in a nice black case with a magnetic flap. Like the other Pilot pens, this does not have a threaded cap. Pilot makes awesome writing pens and this one is no exception! All the capped pens I've used in the past have been basic bargain pens.I worry that the cap could become lost. I have always been impressed by Pilot pens and this Rollerball pen is no exception. I have had rather expensive pens given to me as gifts that do not approach this one for comfort in use. Compared to other pens (of the same sort) this one is comparable, especially if you enjoy calligraphy or fancy cursive. Then again, that's what I've come to expect from Pilot pens. I guess I'm used to the pens that came out with a sort of rubbery texture or sure grip. I own Montblancs pens which range from $300-$500 dollars. At first I thought the pens were a little too hefty, but the more I wrote with them the more I liked them. I got two of these &#34;Animal Collection&#34; pens and found both of them work quite well and have a decent heft to them as well.
