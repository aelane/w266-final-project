This "starter kit" includes 9 folders and one sheet of 16 labels. The kit retails here at Amazon for $7.99 so compared to buying a box of 100 colored file folders, or a pack of 50 manilla folders, it is very overpriced. The kit is great since it comes with labels, and the area to write is bigger than usual. If the kit was cheaper, I would recommend these.

It was not intimidating for her like a more elaborate kit might be. This MO (My Organizer) starter kit is exactly what it says it is--no more than that: Nine file folders, one sheet of 16 labels, suggestions for use and access to the website for a free label template and more ideas. Because they're packaged as a "starter kit" to go along with their similarly overpriced cardboard filing box, apparently. This isn't a kit and it perplexes me who would buy it.
