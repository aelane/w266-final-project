so you need -- a white eraser, and a marker. Then, I tried my white eraser. My white eraser is one of those that has one half white for pencil and one half gray for pen. The white eraser is much easier to erase the writing with. I tried a white eraser on a #2 pencil, again a big mess. I finally found a white eraser in the house and it worked better but you could still see residual smears.If this product only works correctly with a certain type of eraser then it should really come with an eraser that will work with it properly. Don't even think about using pencil-top eraser, it is too small for the job.Unlike the hanging foldersSmead Erasable FasTab Hanging Folders, 1/3-Cut Tab, Letter, Moss, 20 per Box (64032), the tabs on the SuperTab folders are laminated top to bottom and side to side without paper being exposed, so all your writing will be able to be removed. The eraser to me is worth the one-time purchase. They got all smeary and never came off completely, even though I used the white eraser. I did not have a white eraser so I just used a tissue and scratched away the marker with my fingernail, as a result I don't know how it works with the white eraser.I think this is a niche product because the white eraser and permanent marker don't come with it and I really don't know what a white eraser is. Having to buy a special eraser (and possibly a special pen if you don't keep such things around) makes the value of using a pen over a handy pencil rather dubious.These are nice enough folders, and if you're anal retentive about your filing such that you need to write in thick dark pen and be able to erase it (rather than put a label over it or use white-out to cover it and write on it again), these are going to make you pretty happy. I've since learned that the eraser in question is made of hi-polymer and sells for a bit more than the pink ones.So don't order the folders expecting to use just any old standard eraser.I bought the white eraser and new sharp Sharpies and the folders do erase quite well. The PR's right - it would be easy to erase and revise (if you can locate that white eraser).
