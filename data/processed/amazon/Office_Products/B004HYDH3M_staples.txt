Nothing special, but it works well and staples through a large stack of papers without a ton of effort and without jamming.I also like the fact that you load the staples by pushing a button on the stapler which pushes the front out and you can just drop the staples in. There were no staples included with the stapler, and standard size staples don't fit. However, there were no staples supplied with it. Provide at least 100 staples with the stapler. These could poke out, and the special staples it uses are pretty sharp. All in all I would have found this to be useful once figuring out how to load it but it didn't come with any staples. I don't have any of the necessary staples that it requires and Amazon doesn't sell them. If I would have known it didn't come with staples to try it I wouldn't have asked to have it sent to me. If I had realized this did not use standard staples I probably would not have ordered. If you are getting this, make sure to purchase staples along with it. No staples came in the package; Bostitch has since decided to package a sample stick with each stapler, and their Customer Service department sent me some so that I could fully review it.In contrast to comments by other (Vine) reviewers - this stapler will NOT accept standard staples. You have to buy special staples specifically, and it doesn't even come with one starter strip. Because the required staples, B8 Power Crown Premium staples STCR75XHC, cost 9.19 for a box of 1,000. The staples DO lay flat on big piles or even just two sheets. While the staples ARE heavy duty (almost like those in an Arrow staple gun), at TEN TIMES the price of regular staples one has to seriously think about the cost factor of using this stapler. These staples are, quite simply, UNAVAILABLE locally. Most expensive staples out there.Even if you need to staple multiple pages (>50), I feel thatSwingline Deluxe Heavy Duty Stapler (S7039005R), which, as of now is a few cents more expensive, is better constructed and more ergonomic stapler. If the staples were easier to find, it would be an easy 5 stars for a quality product you'll probably use for years to come.
