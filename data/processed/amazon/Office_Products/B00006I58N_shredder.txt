Besides not overloading your shredder's capabilities or shredding material that you shouldn't, the next best thing you can do to protect your investment is to regularly lubricate the cutters. I am on my second shredder. The shredder is three years old now and operates as well as new. After my shredder started to make slow progress taking papers to be destroyed, I ordered this oil to fix the problem. So far, my latest shredder is running smooth as silk, with this simple bit of prevent. I bought this with a cross-cut shredder as I thought perhaps some special type of oil was needed to lubricate the machine (true with many items.) As it turns out, my shredder can be lubed with simple cooking oil; my bad.Knowing what I now know, I believe the product is somewhat overpriced. My shredder said to "drizzle some oil on a piece of paper" yada, yada yada. First shredder we had we used spray that came with it, we used it once a month and the shredder last 6 months. I am not advocating that you should not lubricate your shredder, but just plain motor oil will be nearly as good and a lot cheaper considering that you can lubricate many items in your home by using an inexpensive oil can filled with inexpensive motor oil. If you get a decent shredder, like we did, it is also worth the money to get lubricant for it. I have had my shredder for a couple of years with moderate use and there has been no build-up of oil or slow downs in its function. I have used this regularly to maintain my Fellowes Bulldog shredder over the last 4 years.It does its job and definitely makes the shredder sound alot smoother and probably has contributed to the lifespan of the shredder.Thtat being said, its just vegetable oil. Ever since using it, the shredder definitely sounds to be working smoother and definitely more quietly as it shreds. Keeping the shredder oiled properly really helps it running for the long haul. Buy it, use it, and keep that shredder working at peak. It doesn't really matter what make of shredder you have...after a while, you have to oil it to keep the blades happy. Keeps my Royal 10 Sheet shredder in good working order! The shredder seems to like it as it's still going strong. I never oiled my previous shredder and paid the price after about a year. I only have a super cheap-o shredder from wal mart of something. I've now had my crappy shredder for years. But I think my shredder would have died long ago if it wasn't for this lubricating oil made for shredders. I thought my shredder was about to die, but I purchased this product and oiled it up. I'm talking about a shredder that is over 8 years old here! The shredder is new so I don't know how helpful it has been yet but I guess it can't hurt. This shredder oil comes in a large bottle that's easy to use and sturdy enough not avoid leaking. This one is great and hopefully it will keep my new fancy shredder cutting paper for a long, long, time. Fellows makes a superior shredder, and their oil keeps the machine in good shape.This is a keeper and is highly recommended! Until I purchased my Fellowes shredder a couple of years ago, I didn't even know that you needed to oil them. If I wasn't able to keep it right there with my shredder I would probably forget to use it.I purchased this eleven months ago and my bottle is still almost full. That shredder was a Fellows. The Fellowes Shredder Oil is a must have if your going to keep your shredder working perfectly. I bought this together with my Fellowes shredder, and it has kept my shredder working in perfect condition.I
