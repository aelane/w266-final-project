The notes being made of recycled paper means I don't feel guilty about using them lavishly. These sticky notes are pretty pastel colored. Sticky notes are high-quality little squares of paper that have just the right amount of adhesive to stick to paper, but not so much as to pull up parts of the paper. Perfect indeed!I go through these sticky notes like crazy. These are as good as any other sticky notes so why not buy a recycled product? I like that these notes are made with recycled materials, whenever I have a choice to buy something made from recycled vs. not I will almost always choose the recycled materials.I also like that Avery is participating with box tops for education and the same is true when I'm shopping for items that have box tops vs. no box tops, I always get the product that contributes money to support education.These are nice notes that help save the planet and help support public schools and they are a bargain. These sticky notes don't seem like recycled. These sticky notes do what they are supposed to do. These are basically the same "sticky notes" you are familiar with, except for two things- they are made from a much higher quality paper (thicker and a nice grain to the paper), and the colors are a little less "blah". These Avery Sticky Notes work well for temporarily placing notes on almost any surface. They work as well as the 'non-recycled' papersticky notes do. I really need the notes to stay where I put them. These notes are made of recycled paper and that paper is perfectly fine for general use. I love sticky notes b/c I can use them for address changes, phone numbers, etc. I put those notes across my computer monitor for when I get to them.Love that these are made from recycled materials. These sticky notes work well. I seem to burn though sticky notes pretty quickly. These are your standard sticky notes. These sticky notes are great and do the job. These sticky notes are made from 100 percent recycled paper. I love sticky notes. So, I figure that I can't have too many sticky notes!As far as sticky notes go, these are pretty average. Overall, there's not much to say, these are decent sticky notes but nothing special. not much you can say about sticky notes, they work great, and at the same time, you help a good cause... kudos to avery for being charitable... These sticky notes are ...as shown in title...perfect in every way....  the right size for a message or to make  big print stand out, good "stick" on back  and good  pastel colors that make the message stand out. Well what can you say about sticky notes? These sticky notes stick, and you can write notes on them, but I have had kind of a hard time with these specific notes in that while I'm writing a note the pen stops putting ink on the paper due to some unseen quality of the paper, and so I have to write on another piece of paper to get the pen started again, and then finish my note. I do not like the sticky notes. I love sticky notes and use them a lot, and I tend to move them around to mark new pages in whatever I am reading or working on. They are sticky notes, yup just like you remember.Pro: You can write on themPro: They can be stuck to stuff without the glue being left behindPro: They can be removed easily without tearingPro: They can be stuck to stuff and removed the stuck againPro: They can hold useless information, or very valuable informationCon: Require a writing utensilCon: Eventually the glue does get tired of being removed then stuck causing an inevitable glue failureCon: They don't read my thoughts and write the notes for meCon: They save passwords to my monitor for anyone using my computer to seeCon: They stay stuck to the fridge while I'm at the grocery store trying to remember what I wrote on them They're sticky notes and they work and there's not much more I can say. These are your basic sticky notes, but in a pastel color selection (light pink, really light blue, and yellow). The avery post-it notes are a nice weight and the colors are a soft muted color so writing can easily be seen on them. Most sticky notes will say right on them that they don't stick to rough or uneven surfaces all that well, and a lot of negative reviews mention that they fell right off the person's untreated particle board or unsurfaced styrofoam. Sticky notes are an office essential, but the use of additional paper is not all that environmentally correct. These "recycled" sticky notes are just as effective as the less-tree-friendly ones, the only difference is that the colors are slightly less bright, which to me is an asset. These recycled Avery sticky notes are pretty much exactly like the non-recycled, 3M Post-it notes I am used to. In general, sticky notes are sticky notes, but the key word here is recycled. These sticky notes by Avery are recycled which puts them ahead of the pack for me. These sticky notes are exactly what you'd expect, having the same thickness, color, opacity, and stickiness of the regular notes. They're more expensive than regular notes, though, so you'd have to really care about using recycled materials to buy these instead. These notes have green, pink, and blue, and they are pastel and bright at the same time, and without that glaring 'neon' look. The notes pop, and ink shows up very well.Earth Friendly: Best of all, these are recycled! I am always posting notes everywhere, so I was glad to try these out for the Amazon Vine customer review program. These sticky notes make you feel good because they come from recycled paper. Same old sticky notes here, but with recycled paper. What's not to love about sticky notes? We use sticky notes daily. Like most sticky notes, this one from Avery works very well. Over-all these are great sticky notes, as long as you do not need to stick them up. These notes come in three attractive pastel colors (pink, green, and blue) and work great.I
