These mechanical pencils work well, and are comfortable to write with. Great pencils for the price, highly recommended. I find the pencils to write well, be comfortable to hold, and erase very nicely.Design:The pencil mechanism is "push to extend"; one pushes the eraser to extend the lead (or retract it). I use these pencils at work because it seems like I cannot find either a pencil or extra leads at the office when I need them.These pencil are comfortable to hold because of the silicone jacket at the bottom of the pencil. Four pencils in very bright colors. I've been using these pencils for about a month now, and I like them. Rating: 4.75 out of 5.These pencils are comfortable to hold thanks to the quality rubber grip at the end. The pencils are relatively robust, and the rubberized grip is easy to hold. These pencils are okay. Four mechanical pencils, two extra sets of dual erasers and a box of 12 leads are included in the package. These mechanical pencils have an easy grip and are a decent size. These mechanical pencils really exceeded my expectations. Some are good, some are great, some are crap.These pencils are nice! Turns out, these are much better than other mechanical pencils I've used.The "gimmick" about these pencils is the dual eraser. I think it will make all other existing disposable mechanical pencils obsolete! Paper Mate Quick Flip 0.5MM Mechanical Pencils, 12 Orange Barrel Pencils (1808786) You get 12 pencils for $10.30 which is an extra 4 pencils compared to 2 sets of this starter set. These pencils are awesome. They are comfortable to handle; the pencils have a grip that makes them easy to keep hold of and write with. These pencils are very dependable and work very well. I highly recommend these pencils for students and around the office or home as well. Love the pencils, Love the colors.Love the spongy, rubber grips that make them more comfortable to hold while writing.Love that it comes withe lead refills and I especially Love the double-ended replacement erasers - it is about time!The one thing that keeps this pencil set from being 5 stars is that there are only two replacement erasers for four pens. The four pencils are each a different color and they have that non-slip material that keeps my fingers in place while writing. I've used quite a few mechanical pencils in my life and the Paper Mate Quick Flip 0.7MM Mechanical Pencil Starter Set, 4 Mechanical Pencils (1808783) is my favorite of all the ones I've used. If you like mechanical pencils, check these out. Four pencils, extra erasers and extra lead -- what's not to like? Papermate Quick Flip Mechanical Pencils.As mechanical pencils go these are great. :) The pencils use 0.7mm lead, which is my preferred diameter since the leads last a long time by not breaking during use. I'll tell you exactly what's wrong with these pencils and give you a better option to select.This pencil is all about the eraser. There are 10 pencils instead of just 4 so it's a few dollars more but it's worth it. I have to admit I love mechanical pencils but I had just moved into an office where everyone uses pens so when I was offered the chance to try out these pencils, I jumped at the chance. The pencils are easy to hold, come in bright colors so that you will always have an easy time finding them and .7 mm lead means that you don't need to press as hard to make your mark as it were. These pencils are comfortable to hold, they are engagingly colorful, and give a good strong line with their .7 mm leads. The pencils are very well made and have a nice grip. I do and love these pencils especially the Paper Mate Quick Flip. Already we have isolated these 4 pencils in different locations in the house and each location is handy for our use. The pencils have a solid/thick enough build to hold comfortably and don't leave me with hand cramps trying to grasp the typical skinny pencil. They like how the pencils are sturdy, the erasers don't tear up their paper, and that the leads don't constantly break like other styles we've tried. I love using mechanical pencils over traditional wood pencils. The PaperMatre QuickFlip Mechanical Pencil Starter Set comes with four brightly colored mechanical pencils that are not only pleasing to the eye of your returning student but also highly functional as well. The pencils themselves give are 0.7mm lead that gives nice clean lines and are comfortable to hold. I enjoy mechanical pencils, no pencil shavings to empty nor sharpeners to chew up the lead ... just plain convenience. These mechanical pencils are economical and the bright colors will interest the kiddoes too.This starter package is a BUY with it's 4 mechanical pencils, 2 extra erasers and lead! Paper Mate Quick Flip 0.7MM Mechanical Pencil Starter Set, 4 Mechanical Pencils (1808783)These are good pencils. I love to use pencils, however some don't have dark lead and they fade over several years.. I love these new pencils and could not wait to use them. I love these pencils. The Paper Mate Quick Flip 0.7MM Mechanical Pencil Starter Set, features 4, brightly colored mechanical pencils, with dual erasers so it's tough to wear them out. I supply my own mechanical pencils at work. Four brightly colored mechanical pencils with double flip erasers, a package of extra lead refills, and extra eraser refills in an affordable bundle that is perfect for back to school. These pencils feel solid in your hand. Personally, I am ok with the tried and true "manual" pencils given that we have a power sharpener at the ready in our kitchen. Mechanical pencils with extra leads and rubber grips for your fingers are nothing new but extra erasers and erasers that flip are something quite new. For around $5.00 you get 4 brightly attractive pencils in blue, green, orange and purple. Besides the 4 pencils, Paper Mate includes 2 more dual erasers and 12 more refillable leads. These pencils are great, the erasers are fantastic and you can't beat the price on this starter set for students or professionals of all ages! Mechanical pencils are handy because they don't need sharpening. Paper Mate Quick Flip Mechanical pencils have a built-in grip that is soft and comfortable. I tend to steer clear of mechanical pencils. Some of the other mechanical pencils the lead keeps breaking, and you must keep pushing up more lead. These pencils are great!I
