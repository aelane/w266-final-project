This pop-up purse dispenser is great. I couldn't pass up this purse dispenser because in a male dominated field, I needed something a little girly! If you want a  purse shaped post-it note dispenser, then this is great! The purse (acting a a base and holder) is heavy and heavy-duty. This adorable little black purse is a nice size, sturdy, weighted "purse" that holds the 3 inch Post-its and easily lets you grab one when you need it. The purse can be used as a paper weight or just a cute funtional object.It's a fun adition to a boring office desk...great little gift for your co-worker too. This black purse dispenser is not only attractive, but its a fun way to keep your Post-it notes safe and easy to find and use. The purse dispenser is so cute and adds a sense of style to my home office. This little cute post-it purse looks exactly like the picture! This is one purse you can leave at the office. The purse holder is heavy, so it could double as a paper weight, and there is room inside for a refill pad too.I haven't seen any yet, but it would be nice if they had some masculine designs to choose from, then I would get one for my husband's office.
