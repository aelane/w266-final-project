These tickets are substantial stock, but they still feed through our Oki LED printer and yield good image results. These are lovely, bright white and firm tickets, and I'm sure they're marvelous for tickets and raffles and anything like that, but I found a different and very handy use for them!I've punched little holes in the top bit, where I can write a description of the doll I made, and put the price on the tear-way bit, so they can be given as gifts without the recipient seeing the price, while still getting the information about the doll, her name, fabrics used, etc!I really like these, and will continue using them for this purpose, and am really pleased to have found such a cost-effective and perfect item for my needs. The tickets were off kilter and didn't print in the correct boxes. So, only 5 of the 10 tickets were usable.I like that you can print on the back and front of the tickets (if your printer can do this, which mine can't automatically). When I first saw these tickets, I never felt like I would use them for legitimate raffle tickets. These Avery tickets are just the thing for my class reunion to be held later this year. The tickets printed quite well . If you want to have numbered tickets, designing them online is your only choice.You also have to take into account minimum printer margins. When Avery converted my tickets to PDF it compressed my text boxes so they overlapped and the resulting tickets are unusable.In the end I gave up on these tickets and went back and used the stock I used previously.Bottom LineThe ticket stock itself is up to Avery's usual high standards. I would recommend these tickets for any group needing tickets with stubs. These worked out great to make raffle tickets for our school fundraiser. The tickets are perforated for easy separation.I had a hard time finding the templates for this product but finally did. You can design all the tickets the same, or make a sheet with all different looking tickets. Being able to print our own tickets allows us add our marketing information and include coupon offers, even to "non-winners", and is so much more classy than the standard "ticket rolls" we used to use.Printing on these can be a challenge using the Avery template for MS Word and I eventually just ended up making my own in MS PowerPoint. The tickets were easy to tear and the Avery website gives great ideas for sample raffles. Having the tickets numbered also helps prevent folks from making copies of the tickets.I like these Avery tickets, but the packaging is slightly misleading if you're not paying close attention. These tickets are NOT numbered. If that's not important to you, then these are great tickets. However, if you DO need numbered tickets, then you'll either need a numbering machine like this one:Economy Auto Numbering Machine, 6 Wheels, Pre-inked, or you'll need to buy pre-numbered tickets like these:400 Label Outfitters Blue Numbered Printable Raffle Tickets for Ink Jet or Laser, Numbered Stub. They make tickets for train rides, movie night, contests, prize drawings, magic shows - you name it. The tickets are a nice a thick, but not too thick paper with perforated sections. You can specify numbering if your tickets have numbers and than just print. I have saved the "tickets" they created and am planning to scrapbook some events and use the ticket in the design.The child friendly systems are still new and are a work in progress, but the kids seem to like it. They especially like making their own tickets. If you need tickets, these should do nicely. These tickets are great for many uses. There are 10 tickets per sheet, and 20 sheets per package.Overall: 3/5 stars, Avery should have made sure a template was available on their web site. She wanted to print out tickets for each person that came and then give prizes to whomever won.So we used these as our guinea pig because we never printed tickets this way before. It will seem so classy to have tear off tickets! Those junky little tickets you get on spools might look generic, but they're really cheap. These tickets are a lot of fun. The Avery tickets have the perfect weight of paper, ensuring that it runs thru my ink jet printer without problems, yet is thick enough to feel and look professional. Leave the 'stubs' on the tickets as receipts for people and that's it.What I found is the tickets print nice and clean on the bright side, the top, which is coated with an 'eggshell' matte sheen. Since all tickets have a top and bottom, this isn't a big deal in how it looks/feels. These Avery tickets are designed for small runs where you want a customized raffle ticket for an event, perhaps a school or religious function. Sure you could buy non-custom tickets at the office supply store, but how cool would it be for each person to hold an "official" raffle ticket from your event instead of a generic little red ticket? The tickets themselves tear apart easily, and I found I could quickly free the tickets without accidentally tearing the stub.A few things would have improved the overall product. The tickets printed out neatly, the stubs tore off cleanly, and the whole thing looked really professional. The tear-away tickets themselves work great. What I really wanted to do was edit several tickets at a time because I wanted a quantity of 3, 3, 2, and 2 tickets all with different designs on the same page. These tickets are especially useful for events that include door prizes. So these tickets are okay for the average small job but getting a good design can be a little difficult and time consuming.You have two choices, one is to use their online template (which actually is probably easier than choice number two). I designed my tickets to the edge of the paper and turned off (against advice) "Don't scale image." There's 200 tickets per pack. You're printing tickets on cardboard stock.2) If you want to print color tickets and you have an inkjet, remember that retail color inkjet ink is expensive. I am currently preparing to sell raffle tickets for a raffle with amazing prizes and this product is playing a key role.The Avery matte white tickets with tear-away stubs, made in the USA, are designed to "easily customize and number your tickets." I printed my finished tickets on a regular piece of paper to find that several elements were cut off at the printing edges. The tickets appear to be professionally created, stay together in transit, and come apart easily. The Avery tickets with tear-away stubs are definitely worth purchasing.PROS:Auto numberingProfessional looking resultsTickets stay together and tear apart easilyCONS:Clunky ticket creation processNo bleed lines These tickets were great because they tear well and I didn't have a problem with a lot of them ripping off and not working. These tickets were very easy to use. I made raffle tickets for a small preschool auction and these tickets made it look like a million bucks. I probably spent 45 creating the tickets I wanted (but I'm pretty good with desktop publishing), and then they printed out in 10 minutes! I used these tickets to create an invitation to my upcoming piano recital. I found it easy to create tickets using the free online software form Avery. These tickets are fairly easy to use, we used the Avery website's templates and designed tickets for our event, there were some annoying glitches on the Avery website that caused our preview images to either have half of the image not show up, it took some time to have the preview show all of the image we wanted to print.When it came time to print the tickets we had to make sure the laser printer we used would pull the thick (like card stock) paper in evenly, the first set we printed came out crooked. Then when we went to separate the tickets we did not fold them back and forth on the seam enough and they frayed. I went ahead and made some special tickets for the kids to play with, but WOW, the template Avery offers needs help.Just taking Avery's tips I went to their website at[...] and pulled up the template for 16154. I am using them to make tickets for a kids' band.They are really fun and easy to make and use.A confidence/popularity boost to any event. There are only 200 tickets in the package and the task of creating and printing them would be far too daunting for printing more than a few tickets at a time. Printing a "few" tickets is where this product excels, however.When I need "Keep the stub" tickets for business events I buy them by the roll of 2000 for about $7 a roll. These tickets are perfect for that (or school events) because:1. The tickets have two kinds of perf, the perf used to separate the ticket from the sheet "gives" a little easier than the perf that separates the main part of the ticket from the stub. Purchased these tickets to help promote our American Legion Baseball team. These tickets come on sturdy printer stock, 10 to a sheet for 100 tickets in the package. The tickets separate easily, and the perforated section comes off relatively easily -- but doesn't fall off (which is important).Avery has a handy online design site that lets you design the tickets without having to install a bunch of software. The individual tickets hold together well as a sheet, and then tear apart easily. Since they are tickets, we cannot laminate them. These tickets worked fabulously for our last event, helping us quickly verify invitees because they had tickets (which would be impossible to duplicate) and pass out drink tickets made from a second set of Avery tickets.PROS- Very customizable, we used our logo and a picture. The tickets would have no value whatsoever to a consumer who did not have an internet connection. The tickets are simple enough, and without decent software, they are pretty useless. You can also design all tickets and modify an individual ticket. Personally, I use them to make up tickets for things with my kids, so they are perfect for us.The paper is like white cardstock. Also, once printed, the individual tickets are simple to pull apart after a quick fold along the seam.The online design software was fairly intuitive for simple designs. The tickets were much thinner than I expected.

These tickets by Avery are nice and relatively easy to use once you figure out how to make them.

That meant I had to redesign the tickets in order to use these tickets.

I then proceeded to design tickets using both the Word template and the online service.Using the Word TemplateThe Word template is laid out in a table, and as such has all limitations of working with tables in Word.
