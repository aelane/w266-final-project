Good envelopes, nice big 500 pack! These #10 envelopes are first quality and seal easily. If you need envelopes and dislike licking the flaps, these are for you. great envelopes stick well next time im buying 2 boxes cause my daughter is always stealing mine. other that that not much to say about envelopes buy them These envelopes are just what I was looking for. They are stiffer than ordinary envelopes, due to the use of 24-pound paper. They are far harder to look through than ordinary envelopes because of the security tint / pattern as well as the increased opacity.5. I am pleased with these envelopes. These Columbian CO284, seal-sealing envelopes, meet most of our expectations. So, I'm always using envelopes. Now some envelopes - when you lick them - are dry and gritty; and the taste remins you of a horse's hoof. These envelopes are exactly as specified in the description. The envelopes looks regular as the other envelopes. What can be wrong with envelopes? These self-seal envelopes by Mead with their inside tint make it much harder for anyone to hold the envelope up to a light and see what's inside the envelope. These envelopes are nice to use, because you don't have to lick them. These are great envelopes at a great price. These envelopes have the security lines in them which makes it hard for anyone to spy on your mail, a big box like this will last many years for the occasional letter sender, and is a great supply for a person running a business. These are fine envelopes; but if you are buying them for the advertised security tint, they make poor security envelopes. Very good envelopes. Overall these are good envelopes. Got these envelopes off Amazon just because they were a great deal for a 100-count.
