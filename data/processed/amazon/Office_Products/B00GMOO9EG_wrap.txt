There is also bubble wrap, which is moderately ok, with small bubbles.The tape is strong enough for its intended purpose. However, I am quite sure you will need more bubble wrap if you are moving. If you were to buy the bubble wrap separately, it could (shockingly) cost about $10. This isn't super bubble wrap, btw, but it's decent stuff. The bubble wrap, a black permanent marker, and packing tape certainly are well welcome items, that work very well as a unit. As far as the bubble wrap goes, I only got one - not four. The bubble wrap was just wadded inside - not that it matters. The bubble wrap actually went farther than I expected - I was able to wrap up all of my dishes with it. The bubble wrap was minimal, but we didn't need much anyway. The bubble wrap was not a roll, just some pieces. This kit really needs more bubble wrap; the four small rolls that are included do not go very far at all.It's a decent kit overall, it's worth buying for the boxes even if the extras don't add much value. The bubble wrap is a disapointment. If you have breakables you will need to buy extra bubble wrap as what is included here won't protect much.The price point is pretty good on the product at around $45.00. For bubble wrap I used an approximate price for the amount of bubble wrap included) the price for the boxes comes out to $36.50. The bubble wrap is random sizes; essentially whatever fit in the box after the boxes were placed in it.It would probably hold a small kitchen's worth of dishes, glasses, pots and pans or, as stated, a small dorm room. You don't get much bubble wrap. The bubble wrap and packing tape are a nice addition, but there isn't a lot included, so you might need to re-use or buy some extra. I've received more bubble wrap with things I've ordered online than you'll get in one of these rolls. The bubble wrap came in four large folded sheets of wrap, not a roll, which was fine. The bubble wrap is good, although seems barely enough for one box-full of things.
