It is awkward to open as the plastic is more flimsy and the lock is so solid and a bit hard to pop open. Inside are seven clear plastic dividers, with tabs on top and a scored piece of paper to write topics so you can label the files. But I found that the plastic is thick and sturdy enough so that I can bend the top back so that it lays flat while I sort through the files, taking out and putting in. The plastic is very sturdy and the color really cute. It is made of sturdy plastic and the pink is a nice color that she enjoys. If overfilled, the plastic snap closer will not work. It's made of sturdy plastic and clips shut. It's plastic. The plastic seems pretty sturdy and I like the color. This is a really cute plastic folder, with seven internal plastic divider sheets. It doesn't look like a cheap plastic filer, but it is made from polypropylene.My boyfriend described the color as &#34;aggressively pink&#34;. All plastic, with 7 pockets that are loosely divided to allow some sections to be larger than others. It has a simple plastic clasp to lock the whole thing, so don't bulk up on it as it does not allow for much hold. Well made and strong plastic.
