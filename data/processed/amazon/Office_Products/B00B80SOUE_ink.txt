), the ink stays put and doesn't smudge! Surprisingly, the TEKwriter black ink was extremely smudge prone even without any obvious droplets. The ink could not be washed away and it could not be rubbed off when wet without severe damage to the paper. However, rubbing the ink while wet with alcohol was a different story. After drying the ink, I took a piece of blotting paper, wetted it with alcohol and then gently rubbed the ink. For most of them, the ink flows smoothly and the pen glides across the page. The ink dries quickly on the paper as well, but, just like other gel pens, the ink can be smeared if touched immediately. I am left handed and these have (so far) not given me the side-of-hand ink spots us leftys are so familiar with.I would have preferred a wider grip, but overall I like these pens. The ink color spectrum is wide enough that I'll be able to take notes in a different color for each chapter next semester (if I choose to do so). Also, the ink requires several seconds to properly dry (glitter and metallic longer) which could be a non-starter for lefties hoping to use these for general writing. Once dry, however, the ink is water resistant (not waterproof), so there will be feathering but the line will remain clear and legible, and the ink is alcohol resistant so I'd feel confident using these on checks, legal, or other important documents.INK LONGEVITYAlthough in general gel pens will burn through ink rapidly (with the exception of a few notables such as Pilot, Uni-ball, and Pentel), the short lifespan of these pens had me doing a double-take.Writing top to bottom, side to side on 8.5"x11" college rule paper, one will only get about 6-8 pages (3-4 sheets) on a single barrel of ink. The ink is so smooth and just glides over the paper.
