I found it significantly easier to use than regular Scotch tape. This tape does nearly disappear on gift wrap and does hold very securely -- almost too securely; while wrapping Christmas gifts, I realized how dependent I was on being able to carefully peel back a bit of tape and reposition it when necessary. That can't be done with this tape; once it's stuck, it's stuck.The one thing I didn't like about the tape is that it was somewhat hard to tear off the roll. This is very impressive tape. What can I say, it's Scotch tape. Dealing with tape that doesn't want to break when you cut it, tape that won't cut straight, tape that is slightly yellow, well, for me anyhow that is a frustration I am glad to do without during the holidays. It works just as well as regular "Magic" tape. Though that tape also does a great job when used for wrapping, the Satin Finish tape is better.The only problem I had is that I was really surprised at how little tape came on each of these three rolls; it was ridiculous. The best tape for  gifts - Scotch is the only brand I use. This 3-pack of Scotch tape works really well but the thing is, especially during the holidays with Christmas approaching, you'll go through 3 of these very quickly. Anyway the tape is sticky and reliable enough that I can easily recommend it to anyone and let's be honest, we *all* will unexpectedly need Scotch tape for one reason or another, and it's good to have a pack around when these moments come. You expect tape to do a couple tasks: Adhere and disappear.Scotch does both. I think this is the best tape for your money and it's the kind I always buy. I won't use any other tape for gift wrapping. What can you say about great tape? Like the Scotch tape of old, it has a shiny surface, unlike the second-generation "Magic Tape" Scotch tape which virtually disappears on paper with a conventional "rough" surface. This Scotch Satin GiftWrap Tape does what tape should do - it's easy to use, sticks to paper effortlessly and is great for wrapping gifts. You can barely see this tape so any presents you wrap will look flawless. Now I'm going to confess that Scotch makes the best tape for everything. This tape works great for gifts because it almost disappears after you put it on to give a nice clean look. When you compare it to the standard tape with a non-gloss finish, this tape blends into the packaging material better than the standard. It's pretty good tape, and a pleasure to use, but it is just tape. This Scotch tape is perfect. I probably wouldn't use this tape for gift wrapping after realizing -like many of the other reviewers- that there is not a whole lot of tape on each roll. It is also important to note that the tape feels really silky and soft and it it difficult to feel where the edges are. While the glossy tape that I use at the office is good for keeping things together, it shows up very easily on gift wrap, being all shiny. This is great tape for wrapping presents, it truly does become almost invisible when applied to the wrapping paper. I love this tape, I've been buying it for a few years. It seems that with this Gift Wrap tape, the actual adhesive on the film is more microscopic so you can't see the texture like you do with regular Scotch tape.As far as the 3 roll thing, I much prefer to buy a regular roll and put it into a dispenser. We've only ever use Scotch tape at my house, it's the tape that holds up better in not ripping or tearing when you don't want it to. The Gift Wrap tape is excellent for wrapping any gifts as it boasts a certain amount invisibility. I normally just use regular tape to seal wrapping paper and thought it looked fine. I love this tape for gift wrapping because you almost can't tell the tape is there, unlike the green version. The tape was completely invisible. Even the Magic tape showed up.There was a huge difference in the ease of the tape. The Gift Wrap tape was silky and smooth and went easily from dispenser to paper. You can NOT go wrong with scotch tape. I used this tape on both a solid blue colored wrap and a mulit-colored paper and it worked great on both. It was also invisable where I used the tape to attach the little envelope with the gift tag and note,  I recommend this tape and will probably end up using it for more than just gift wrapping.. it's a very nice tape for everyday use as well. I guess you might say tape is tape is tape but there are varying qualities from the cheap generic to the more expensive name brands like Scotch. This particular tape sticks on flat and clear so as not to obscure your wrapping paper. You get the tape stuck in the wrong place and try to remove it, you have a mess. What more can ya want in tape? Sure, regular clear tape works fine for gift-wrapping, but if you want your gifts to look like they're professionally wrapped with a tape that blends into the wrapping paper so well you almost don't know it's there, this is the tape for you. Now that I've used this tape, I just can't go back to the old tape I used to use.A quick tip: If you press down and smooth the tape with your fingers after it's on the gift, the tape blends in with the wrapping paper even more and looks like it almost disappears.Great product! The tape adheres well and does everything you could rationally ask of it. I'd rather get more tape, even if it means paying more, so that there is a reasonable amount on the roll, and there would be far less waste. Altogether, the tape is nice and the price seems fair. You can still see the tape of course but it's much less visible than normal tape.If you wrap a lot of presents or are a Martha Stewart-type perfectionist, you might want to consider this tape. The tape - at first I wondered: "How can this be different?". For a "tape collector" I guess it is slightly between "magic" and clear tape. The tape breaks off of the roll easily, and does not bend or warp. The tape always sticks well, holds tight and remains clear. Its hard to see the tape on the gifts I had to wrap. Tried some cheaper tape. This tape is perfect for wrapping all of your presents. I think this tape is pretty great and sure is convenient. This tape has an excellent adhesive, sticking to paper or foil with no problem. As advertised, the tape is almost invisible on the package. Scotch Gift tape is a great product for its intended purpose - wrapping gifts. The tape is much less noticeable on typical gift wrap than either Scotch Magic Tape (which is a bit too matte for this purpose) or shiny generic tapes.But I have to mark down this particular product down because the amount of product given is so stingy. The tape is not shiny it has a matte finish and doesn't stick out when used on gift wrap. The old tape is translucent with a foggy finish. The new tape is slightly clearer and more glossy. It's tape. Now use the best tape there is to seal the deal!Scotch Giftwrap Tape has a unique satin finish that helps the tape disappear on the wrapping paper. The tape is sturdy and invisible against the wrapping paper background. We went through these 3 tape dispensers very quickly. Cheaper tape can be fine for general purpose taping (although I still prefer 3M products), but for gift-wrapping, quality is a must. This tape dispenses evenly and easily, cuts cleanly, applies easily, and is truly nearly invisible once applied. The tape holds well as long as stress is lateral to the tape. I think it is slightly less tacky than general-purpose tape. There is not must else to say about tape. This special tape is perfect for holiday wrapping chores. I've too often bought bargain-brand tape for the holidays, and it is just not worth it. Well, this tape doesn't make wrapping a pleasure, but it does make it easy and quick, with a lovely professional appearance. I know, it's tape. Scotch tape to be precise. But that is what sets this tape apart from the competition. If you're looking for a matte-finish tape, I'd definitely start here. While it wasn't my preferred tape [I like the Magic Scotch tape] it was tape and it allowed me to get the job done.I like this gift wrap tape, but I don't love it. This tape seems to be more adhesive than the magic tape as well. I used this tape, which has more of a sheen than regular "invisible" tape, on several different kinds of gift wrap. The tape comes off the roll very easily which is a huge plus in my opinion. This tape, however, works exactly as you'd expect, and even a little better. of tape is a whole lot of tape)For those of you traveling this holiday season with a small child who must be quiet, I offer one other use for this tape. She played with the tape until she tired of it, then fell asleep as I removed the played-with tape. The clear tape all but disappears on wrapping paper. It's really great tape. If you want tape that completely disappears on matte surfaces, go for the magic tape instead of this one. I used this tape over the holidays for all my gift wrapping, and was very pleased with how it performed.First, it really does disappear on most gift wraps -- only on the shiniest foil wrap was I able to see the tape. I managed to grab one and pull the tape across the inch long gap so I can scrape it across the jagged plastic teeth for severing it. Why do all tape dispensers have this long gap between the roll and the cutting surface? Invariably, the exposed tape picks up dust, lint, dirt, even small insects and then has to be discarded (and the extra size seems a wasteful use of extruded plastic). This tape is not going to be applied to most gifts, so it really does not affect how they look. Scotch tape works just as it should and the 3-pack is a good deal especially for all the wrapping that needs done in the Christmas season. Love this tape. Other than that, it's still basically just tape, but it gets the job done and won't get in the way of your wrapping paper.If there's one complaint, and I only have this one, it's that there really isn't very much of it on a roll. This tape really does a great job and hardly shows at all. :-)  It's tape, after all.

"Invisible tape" they call it, the deluded fools.

You like that this tape is determined "Photo Safe" according to the rigorous ISO Standard 14523.

I give the tape itself 5 stars -it is fantastic, and is really the best tape to use on wrapping paper, because it does a great job of disappearing.
