this'll dothis paper gets the job done, with the Canon selphy printerI have seen folks around the cathedral in Ciudad Juarez dragging around one of those tiny printers and a DC power supply to instantly crank out snapshots of the touristsgets her doneas well as any big rig photoshop desktop set upcheapo cheapo but gets her done at a professional qualitynow just learn to use that camera and take pro shots, nicely planned, and you have all that you needgood papergets her done You can't use your everyday 4x6 paper in the Canon Selphy, it must be this kind of paper. This paper and ink is way better than others though, and it is one of the reasons why people buy Canon Selphy printers. great paper and ink my photos turn out really good. This photo paper works great in my small printer. This is the only paper and ink that works with my Canon SELPHY CP900 portable printer. paper and ink cartridges are perfect fit for cp800. paper has perforated edges and not one of my photos left messy edges. paper is a good weight and just enough shine. paper is slightly and i mean slightly smaller than normal 4x6 paper. I am happy with the paper ... no issues or problems.
