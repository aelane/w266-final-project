!That said, the PaperPro stapler staples crisply, neatly and quickly. I looked and tugged at the stapler for a while before reading the instructions on the box which told me to invert it to open it. I tried to open the stapler hinge, as I can on other office staplers so that you can use it on a bulletin board. Just an observation.The stapler is very lightweight and made entirely of plastic, so I am curious how durable it really is and how long it will last. Overall this is a very nice stapler that works efficiently, is priced right, and should be trouble free. When I first received this stapler I was somewhat apprehensive as it was lightweight and I felt it looked cheap. The stapler is also "Jam Free". The stapler "jammed" and would not feed the staples after six months of use. I mailed the stapler back to the company and in return they sent me a new stapler. I still recommend highly this stapler. It is still the best stapler I have ever owned or used. I recommend you look at this stapler instead:Swingline LightTouch Compact Reduced Effort Stapler (66412) This is a decent stapler, and it does easily staple up to 20 pages as advertised. The stapler is completely mechanical in operation.With such a powerful and easy to use stapling system, the PaperPro Evo Desktop Stapler seems like a product deserving of an easy five star rating, but after using it for a while, I found two potential problems that could make this stapler impractical for some. You cannot open up the stapler and use it to press staples into a wall or bulletin board. It's an efficient stapler at a decent price. I had hoped this compact stapler would be one that I would use often, particularly since hand problems preclude the use of heavy staplers. It is probable that the stapler will be easily cracked or broken if knocked off the edge of a desk onto the tile floor or if one drops it because of an inability to grasp items firmly.The Paper-Pro Evo Desktop Stapler is quite noisy. This stapler cannot be opened to staple items on bulletin boards; it is good only for stapling papers together.This stapler is particularly difficult to load. I have to say that when I first used this stapler, I thought because it was so light weight that it was a cheaply made product, but I have to say that it is a pretty good little work horse. This little stapler does exactly what it claims, once you figure out how to load staples. )Overall, I would recommend this little stapler. Indeed, what CAN you say about a stapler? This new stapler from PaperPro is a nice, light weight unit, handy for keeping in your brief case, if you frequently have a need for a stapler. If you frequently need a stapler when you're on the go to a meeting, etc. This stapler does well with stapling up to 12-15 sheets, but then it the staple starts to not close all the way on the back of the sheets. It's not too bad if you're looking for a stapler to do a little more paper. Ergonomically, it is the best stapler I have handled, especially with regards to loading new staples. If you use a stapler regularly, this is the one you should pick up. The stapler advertises that you can staple together at least 20 pages with a single finger, and I must say that the stapler lives up to that promise. This stapler solves all of those problems, it is definitely something that I would recommend to other people. I love the stapler for the simple reason that it lives up to its promises. So, we are now a one great stapler family! I couldn't figure out how to get the stapler open. This stapler has not lived up to its competition and is now broken and unusable. What can you really say about a stapler? I expect a stapler to have some heft to it so that it is stable to use, but this stapler does not feel stable in my hand. So if you have to travel with a stapler and aren't planning on stapling a major project, it will be fine for that task. I was interested to see how a stapler can staple 20 pages with one finger. I was very attached to my old Swingline stapler, but it weighed a ton and you had to apply so much pressure to get it to staple. This stapler solves the past safety issue I had by not opening up all the way (as it would need to when using it on a bulletin board). You need to pull slightly up on the stapler bottom before trying to slide it open. I was able to get it back in there, and the stapler works now, but it doesn't hold the staples tightly, and I have to lean it forward so that gravity ensures the staples are ready, when the spring is unreliable. The stapler is good with the gun action and easily staples 20 sheets of paper. This is not my favorite stapler for one reason: it feels cheap. Overall I would stick with a more traditional stapler unless you really want the ability to staple with one finger. I like this stapler, but I have to ask whether there really was something terribly wrong with traditional staplers that necessitated this design? This stapler works on stacks of paper that are 20 sheets or less, a thickness that was never really that much trouble for my old staplers. Unlike a traditional stapler, you can't open up this design without breaking it, and there are no repair suggestions on the Paperpro website. Perfectly acceptable stapler at a good price. It is a good stapler however. I found the PaperPro Evo Desktop Stapler to be a good stapler but with a twist. The stapler, like a much more powerful staple gun, has a internal spring setup so that no matter how many papers you are stapling, it always takes the same amount of pressure to activate. I actually like this stapler.
