We have this printer for few months and we have already replaced ink cartridge 6 times! We do not use the printer often - just occasional for printing homework for school or work. I used to have HP printer and it operates until the ink cartridge is empty....So get ready to spend money for ink cartridges if you are buying this printer... Great basic printer. You can modify this printer and put an external waste ink tank. I'll never have another printer which uses "color" print cartridges with tiny amounts of each color all bound up into one unit. When this printer works it is great! If you do not use this printer everyday, you can forget about it. This printer zips through color printing faster than other small color printers i've used. This is not a printer you could use without waking you sleeping baby in the next room.2) The ink cartridges are tiny. This printer produces good quality prints; this includes text and photos that are close to laser quality, and is very fast once it gets going. The printer is so fast that sometime papers go flying right off the paper catch, not a big deal if you are not printing a large project. I feel the printer is worth the price.

I never owned or used an Epson printer so I'm excited t see what all the hype is about.First off the printer looks cool but feels CHEAP!

I'm NOT impressed with this printer.

The printer is pretty quite.Cons: After about 10 photo prints and some coloring pages my kids printed, the ink was done!
