The wireless ability eliminates the need for any cables and is very easy to set up. It has "Epson Connect -- instant wireless printing from popular mobile devices." The Epson WorkForce 645 Wireless is better for those who want wireless printing better than the workforce 630. my sons likes that you can put 250 sheets of paper in the tray, and that the 645 has a 30-page Auto Document Feeder to quickly copy, scan or fax piles of one or two-sided documents. Completely wireless (which took a minute or two to setup), no install CDs needed, just a few clicks and I was done!I've printed everything from full color 8x10 photos on gloss paper to quick black and white drafts with amazing speed and quality (even in draft mode).Two features that I am truly enjoying is the duplexing for those few things that need to be double sided (such as tax forms) and the borderless printing for photos.I don't scan or fax much, so I have yet to really use all of the features of the WorkForce 645 has to offer.Cheap, wireless, great image quality, high capacity paper tray, and cheap 4 color ink... The wireless printers, including this model, now also print from most phones and tablets, both Apple and Android operating systems. It sets up easily with a wireless or wired system. I setup the wireless networking ability on the printer itself - easy enough. From the ADF, to the wireless connectivity, I've yet to find one portion of this printer that hasn't bested every effort I've experienced from other manufacturers. The wireless connectivity worked well, so now I can generate documents, maps, and directions from the mancave, and send it upstairs to the people who asked for it in the first place.

The Epson Workforce 645 is a wireless, all-in-one printer that is perfect for home or for a very small office.

If you do not have a wireless network or prefer to use a direct connection, you will need a usb printer cable before setting up your printer.

If your wireless network is not set to broadcast, like mine, you will add it manually through the front control panel.The four included ink cartridges are full-size, extra-capacity, but the manual states that a certain amount of ink is used for the initial priming so you won't get quite as many pages out of these.The printer itself is exceptional.
