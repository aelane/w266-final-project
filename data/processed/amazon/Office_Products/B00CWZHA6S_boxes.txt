They're boxes, so they are very much like other...boxes.Pros:-Well made, sturdy construction-Easy labels on sizeCons:-No handles-Needs to be made with tape (can't just fold them)-Not for heavy items (cardboard is too thin). These boxes are about the same level of quality as the boxes that Amazon uses to ship items, which might help you gauge how thick and solid they are. For sturdier boxes, Bankers Box brand boxes are about the best that I've ever used:  they havethis sizein a tape-less version (the boxes fold in such a way that they seal without tape) with handles for about $4/box, which I personally think is a great alternative.So, these aren't a bad choice, but I would recommend the Bankers Box version at $4/box over these for both convenience of packing (no tape, with handles) and a sturdier box. Believe it or not, there seems to be a high-end and a low-end when it comes to moving boxes, with those self-forming and strong cardboard bankers boxes at the top. The Wholesalers boxes are somewhere near the bottom with their somewhat thinner cardboard walls and a design that may save material but mandates taping both the bottom and the top to complete the assembly.Boxes are rated to about 65 lbs max which should be okay for a box this size.These are not the best or best designed moving boxes in the world but when you need lots of them and price becomes an issue they are a viable alternative to the more pricey 'high end'. Some boxes come with a perforate handle hole with the cardboard still inside it. These boxes aren't top quality or near it, but they're big and cheap. These boxes measure 18 inches by 18 inches by 16 inches and they are about the average size for moving. These boxes are affordably priced. I like to have boxes on hand, especially for things I no longer want in the house or seasonal items that need to be tucked away. At 18 1/8 x 18 x 16" these boxes aren't huge, but just the right size to handle and move easily. The boxes are solid, the price is right, and they are shipped right to your door. The boxes have printed labels so you can describe he contents. It seems most boxes for electronics have sturdier cardboard. These boxes are not high quality, but if the price is less than others, they may be OK for your needs. It's pre-marked with little boxes you can check off for what room the contents are associated with.But really, how hard is it to write on a box? Why recycle those just to buy additional boxes later (which will, by the way, be shipped in a box)? This is 20 boxes (although I only received one to review) and it seems like it might be a bit much of this size. The boxes are of reasonable quality, but are fairly thin and lightweight. Decent moving boxes are so predictably same-y that it&#8217;s a tough assignment to try to compare this product from The Packaging Wholesalers to Uhaul, or any other quality brand out there. And there&#8217;s a grid full of boxes to check on the side, to show where you want the box to go in your new residence.It&#8217;s a reasonable price for a bundle of 20, and if you don&#8217;t&#8217; have a truck to haul a bunch of boxes home, delivery to your door with free shipping from Amazon is a real godsend. These are medium-duty moving boxes, well-made but without any special features or frills other than the pre-printed labelling area (which is not really needed in my opinion) and partially-recycled fiber content&#8212;which is a big plus.I have tried other moving boxes which didn't need tape to assemble or close and which had comfortable handholds, which are useful features when moving. They are not self sealing boxes though so you do need to also have a supply of packaging tape to seal them securely.I can't really say there is any negatives to this box. I'm pointing this out because as moving boxes go this is on the big side which means when filled it's going to be heavy.My advice is to get this box for clothing and other light items but also get some smaller boxes for heavy items like books.BTW: As a Vine reviewer, I only got one box and I used mine to ship a giant steel lobster pot! Overall great boxes. The boxes are printed on the front for easy labeling. There's not much to stay about moving boxes unless something is wrong. These are good basic moving boxes and they are well priced. These boxes are very similar to the ones that the big name van lines and moving companies use. I think these boxes are a great alternative to doing that because you get more for your money considering the price of the rental company boxes keeps going up. Granted those boxes are much more expensive, but the quality was incredible. If you know you'll at least need 20 moving boxes though, these are a great choice for lighter items. These are good boxes for both moving and storage.

I move VERY frequently, so I know my boxes.The check off boxes were nice.

Comparatively, these boxes are about average.

I used these boxes for dishes, bathroom supplies, books, and DVDs without any problems.
