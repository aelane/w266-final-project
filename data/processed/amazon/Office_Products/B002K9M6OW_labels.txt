BTW, if you have those "permanent" labels that can't be easily removed, try using GOOGONE (available on Amazon)and a piece of plastic such as an expired credit card. I found the labels could be taken off and re-attached about 4 times on paper products before the adhesive qualities began to drop off. These labels are also wide. These labels are flexible, convenient, practical. These labels make it easy to see at a glance what you have stored in the bins.We are also using these at an outreach mission for the poor in Appalachia where a lot of clothing is donated. I used them to hand-write labels. I wish these labels were around when I was in college! The labels are certainly removable but they are not sticky enough. If you only want labels for a very temporary job and don't plan on reusing them, these would be a satisfactory choice. These labels stick where you put them and come off without reside. I found these labels worked well, but if you don't like bright electric colors, these may not be for you. I like slightly less saturated labels typically that offer a bit more contrast, but if relying solely on color coding for organization these are useful. These labels are super sticky on most surfaces. These are useful labels for the price. The 450 labels included are more than enough. These labels are just as handy and reliable as the Post-it File Folder Labels (white, removable adhesive) that I reviewed previously. I also like that you can write on the labels with virtually any pen, pencil, sharpie, etc. Love this labels. I had gotten the labels for my office but decided they are a bit too bright for my carefully appointed office. The labels stick securely to paper, wood, plastic bags & cloth, and you can't miss the retina-burning colors, so they're great for color-coding inventory (I'm using them to mark T-shirt sizes).

These labels are absolutely perfect for labeling reloaded ammo boxes. These are good labels.

The removable labels have a strong adhesive so they're quite good as a permanent label; the difference is that you can remove the removable labels without leaving behind label bits and an adhesive mess. I'm not sure I'd go so far as to use the removable labels as a mailing label, but you probably could in a pinch. If you're going to use these labels to put on the front of a file cabinet drawer, or on one of those handy plastic storage bins, or perhaps on the edge of a three ring binder, why would you ever want to remove it?

The 2700-P labels from Post-it are useful labels that work well but I hope they offer more colors at some point. These labels are great for both business and family use.

I like these labels because they're sticky enough to really hold, but not so sticky that they leave a mess.Once I was able to figure out how to run them through my inkjet printer, I was happy. 3M Color-Coding removable adhesive labels (Post-it brand) are very useful for identifying binders, folders, storage bins, etc. Traditional labels can lose its adhesiveness after moving it around a few times, or paper rips...

When I ordered these labels, I was under the impression that they were neon bright and that there would be a small spectrum of colors (eight colors, ideally, but at least six neon colors).I knew that the labels would be of high-quality, and that the repositionable adhesive would be great for labeling my boxes without being stuck to them permanently. I still marked these labels at four stars, because they do their job so well. then you will love these labels. I only wanted these labels for handwritten projects - tax files, credit cards and most importantly, my hobby room, where I used these small labels to clearly organize items without having to worry about the dreaded "Ooops, it won't come off, and now it's ruined."

I'm really not inclined to remove and reposition most labels once I've put them on something, but it's nice to know that that's at least a viable option with these.As labels go, these are pretty thoughtfully made! I do still find myself puzzled by just how pricey labels often are, but comparatively speaking, you'll get more of your money's worth out of the ability to move these around. The labels can be used an average of five times before they don't stick as well. So far, the labels remove quite easily.

I am more impressed with these labels than I imagined I'd be. The labels read clearly with students using a variety of writing utensils to label them with names and since there were several different colors, they could be organized that way. These labels have been awesome for me! These labels are just an offshoot of that.When I am in a creative mood things can get lost in the shuffle. I have used Avery labels before this and these are the same size as the Avery 5160 so I know they would meet my purpose size wise. And sticking labels to many of these surfaces become a messy challenge to remove. But the labels adhere firmly enough that they will never fall off.I had no problems printing and customizing various options. These labels worked with the Avery 5160 template that was already available in MS Word making it very easy to print up labels. When the labels were placed on, they were easily removed... maybe a tad too easy. I have found that I can use regular labels and print the letters themselves in color-which allows me to use the cheaper labels, but still have a color coded system that works just as well at a fraction of the cost. The labels look pretty loose on the backing sheet before they go through the printer, so I wouldn't risk trying this version in an ink-jet.The adhesive is very strong, and I've tried them on plastic containers in the freezer, and on the outside window of the house during freezing weather, and they held tight.t
