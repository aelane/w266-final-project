The wireless setup is a bit interesting; the guide recommends hooking up a USB connection (no USB cable is provided), and letting the install software help configure the wireless options. I was able to setup the wireless easily, and it works well.Features/Pro:Looks. It is easy to set up and the wireless printing is a breeze. I set it up quite easily for wireless. It's quick over wireless and it is truly 1-touch if you want it to be. hooking up the wireless network to it was seamless and easy. Set up, ignoring the wireless issues, was very easy. It is eqipped with wireless so you don't have to plug it in everytime you want to print something. The WorkForce 840 has the wireless capabilities built directly into the device. I really love the wireless printing feature. But that's only because one must enter the wireless network's SSID and password in order to establish the connection - a bit tedious with the printer's touch screen but doable. I have not been using the wireless functionality, so I can not speak on that.I have scanned a lot of documents with it and it has been working great. The wireless connectionworked immediately. What's great is that there is a light to indicate whether or not it is connected to the wireless network. We have a wireless HP Photosmart printer that took forever to install; the Epson Workforce printer took all of about 5 minutes! The wireless capability is seamless and the speed is the best part. I use it in the wireless mode.The printer is easy to configure and use. To install for wireless use, the process takes awhile. This is the second wireless printer I have had and I love that feature. So even though you can put it anywhere you want due to the wireless, you still need a good chunk of space. I normally struggle through trying to get these wireless printers to connect with my device, but had no trouble finding it with my computer tablet. The wireless printing is also a big plus, especially since so many homes now have multiple laptops, plus the odd habit of printers not coming with a USB cord (a tradition still maintained here) is no longer a pain point--one is recommended for setting up WiFi, but it wasn't that hard without one, as the tiltable LCD made things a breeze.Downsides? Epson WorkForce 840 Color Ink Jet Wireless All-in-One with Fax is a fast AIO wireless printer that will let you print two-sided with good quality, scan, copy, fax, with 500-sheet paper capacity, and print directly from mobile devices.Pros:1. Also, if your wireless router is not set to broadcast, the wireless setup may fail doing it from your computer.
