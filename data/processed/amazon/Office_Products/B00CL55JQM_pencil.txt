I needed a pencil sharpener for work, and I loved the idea of the USB plug on this one since my cubicle has a computer but no open electrical outlets. Nicely designed pencil sharpener, flawlessly sharpens to a perfect point each time. Hard to use a pencil when it is in one of those two conditions. This pencil sharpener comes with a USB cord. I wanted a small, electric pencil sharpener, so I was happy to get to try this one. It doesn't sharpen a pencil evenly, so you have to give it a few tries to get a nice point. This is a nice, compact, practical pencil sharpener. I like this pencil sharpener, mostly for the convenience of not requiring batteries when plugged into your computer. I own two other Wescott pencil sharpeners that are really well designed and powerful. This pencil sharpener can be powered by 4xAA batteries (not supplied) which fit in the base, or power off a USB connector via a self-winding cable (provided).Unfortunately, there is little about this device that is well thought out.- The shavings container is not very easy to open for emptying- The USB cable is non-standard, so if you lose it, good bye USB power- It's pretty big and oddly shaped for a pencil sharpener- The USB cable sticks out and there's no place to store it when not in use -- yet another widget to lose- And worst of all... the sharpener itself is not any better than something you could buy at the dollar store -- it's just motorized.Unlike other reviewers, I had no issues with the USB power; this may be because I plugged it into a high power USB port. The pencil sharpener I received isnt the one pictured. I would much rather plug a pencil sharpener into an electric outlet than use AA batteries and a USB cable.Rating: One star What is there to say about a pencil sharpener that doesn't sharpen much? I tried my pencil sharpener with the included USB cord and also with 4 x AA batteries. However it is a great pencil sharpener, works just as well on colored pencils as regular writing pencils, and seems to be holding up well. Then the pencil tips got stuck in the sharpener's blades, and I had to unscrew the top to clean it out, etc., etc. It struggled to re-sharpening an already used pencil and could barely sharpen a new pencil. I love how quickly and efficiently it sharpens a pencil. You just put the pencil into the sharpener with a little pressure and it is perfectly sharpened. This pencil sharpener works great on normal pencils... This is a useful pencil sharpener with a USB cable that can be connected to any computer/laptops equipped with a USB connector. You need to push the pencil a little hard through pencil-hole/port to get a good sharpening. This pencil sharpener, however, is a fairly decent one. That's about all you can cay about a pencil sharpener I guess. Having a pencil sharpener available makes me use a pencil more often knowing I can sharpen it quickly and efficiently. Before it stopped altogether, I noticed that it only sharpened a pencil to a point with a very steep and not too sharp profile, like a golf pencil. I was becoming increasingly frustrated with my cheap manual pencil sharpeners and was thinking of investing in an electric one when I saw this USB capable sharpener and decided to give it a try.I'm so glad I did! This pencil sharpener is quick, easy to empty, and doesn't chew up my cheaper pencils (the ones I keep out and about that inevitably disappear into other people's possession). This is a sleek and stylish pencil sharpener. It is a standard electric pencil sharpener with a regular AC plug. Standard electric pencil sharpeners use a spiral blade with multiple sharp edges to sharpen pencils smoothly... the multiple edges give them a reasonably long life before getting dull. The pencil's end remains dull and rounded as the unit spins, even with slight pressure. I selected this pencil sharpener since it didn't need batteries.
