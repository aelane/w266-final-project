Excellent product upgrade from Avery. I think that is good for this product. I would recommend this product. You can never go wrong with an Avery product. Very nice product. I was impressed with this product because while the labels are a bit smaller than I ones I customarily use, these were quite adequate for all address information. All in all, a fine Avery product. as with other avery product i had come across so far, the paper quality is excellent. I love this product. I love this product and highly recommend repositionable labels.

I was semi-pleased with this product.

Overall this is an okay product, but I wouldn't want to get another pack of the labels.

This product works as advertised.You can re-adjust the label if you place it in the wrong spot, without ripping it all up.They do seem to be a bit pricier than the regular, non-repositionable labels, though.
