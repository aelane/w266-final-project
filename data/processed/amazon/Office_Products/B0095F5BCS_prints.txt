The prints are just fantastic. I was able to compare identical prints that I made with both printers using high-quality Hahnemuhle paper (the best!) If you really need archival prints you should probably look at a pigment based printer. The Pro-100 produces outstanding prints both in color and B&W. That is, beautiful prints (up to 13x19 inches) for proudly displaying and sharing. My initial prints using Canon Photo Paper Plus Semi-Glossy have been outstanding, and ink usage seems reasonable so far. The Canon Pro 100 prints are comparable or better than the Walgreens prints.There are a few negatives: Besides being a very large and heavy printer, one must consider the high cost of ink. It wouldn't matter how easy it is to print if the prints look awful. It was just amazing to look at those BW prints that came out of that printer. Black and white prints were good as well, in my opinion. The prints look wonderfully sharp and vibrant. I actually think these prints are better than the prints from the big online printing companies. I don't think I'll ever have to send my prints out again. In the Epson prints, they're very yellow and orange. The Epson's prints don't.So when it comes to print quality, this Canon wins hands down. )A FULL RANGE OF PAPER SIZES AND MEDIA:  The Pro-100 can handle prints from 4&#34; x 6&#34; to 13&#34; x19&#34;, also including 5&#34; x 7&#34;, 8&#34; x 10&#34;, Letter, Legal, and 11&#34; x 17&#34;. These would be totally acceptable prints for all general use items.The print speed wasn't fantastic, but I found it totally usable.

While this Pro-100 prints better grays and blacks than what the Pro9000 prints, both Canon's Pro-1 and Epson's R3000 can print noticeably superior black-and-white prints when compared to this Pro-100 monochrome prints.

The prints from this, on Canon paper with proper paper profiles chosen, results in some vibrant and amazing results.

In comparing this to the MP990, prints from the Pro 100, as expected, are better.
