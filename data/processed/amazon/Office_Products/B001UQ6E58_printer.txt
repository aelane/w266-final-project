This is my first Brother printer and I am highly impressed. We're actually going to replace an Epson Artisan WiFi printer that we love, due to the additional features this printer offers.Set-up of the printer was a breeze. However, this printer has more features than the Epson or the Canon, which helps justify the additional size.For one, the printer can print 11 x 17 size paper. The printer easily joined my existing network and prints wirelessly without any glitches. )The printer the Brother replaced was a HP AIO that worked nicely for my needs - that is, basically wireless printing of text, and the occasional photocopying chore. this printer is HUGE.It also is a bit on the pricey side, another factor to consider. Still trying to get the printer to connect to the wireless network. - but what else would one expect from a 11x17 printer scanner.So far fairly happy with this printer and am looking forward to experiencing more of it's capabilities This printer is perfect for our needs. If I were going to marry an inanimate object-this printer would be it! This is my second All-In-One printer that supports wireless printing. Ever since have I used a wireless printer, I became a big fan of it, and I will not buy any printer that is not wireless. It is so convenient to put a printer anywhere and is great to print, scan and fax wirelessly. I have never seen an Inkjet printer that does this and it really impressed me.

No.Setting the printer up on MacOS X was quite painless, making for an unexpected treat.

Setting the printer up in Windows was also simple, as expected.
