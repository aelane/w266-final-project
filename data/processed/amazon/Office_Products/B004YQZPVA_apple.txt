The apple is darker than it is in the photo, more like a real apple.I love things that can give some personality to your desk, fun things. This apple one, however, gets 4/5 stars because it is actually pretty hard to load -- it has a stubborn plastic tab that makes it hard to get the cover in place properly. The apple is made of heavy plastic and is weighted with sand inside, so it can double as a paperweight. The apple is nice because it doesn't take up as much desk space being upright in design. The apple is even at an angle, making it easier to grab a sheet.These will only work with the Pop-Up style notes, but I also take normal pads and turn them into these by switching every other sheet around 180 degrees to form a zigzag.The only complaint I have about the apple dispenser specifically is that it's a bit tricky to open and close it for refilling. With the apple, it feels like the tabs might break off, and it's pretty difficult to get it back together properly. Now with the handy apple dispenser, they are right there and ready for use!Very easy to setup and just fun to use! Other than that, The 3M pop-up apple dispenser is a solid product and I can recommend it to anyone.

Well, this apple won't actually keep the doctor away but it can help you remember appointments and shopping lists by keeping post it notes within easy reach.

The apple dispenser not only makes the desk look a lot cleaner, but also functions as a paperweight.The reason I docked it a star is the fact that you have to refill it with Post-It's Pop Ups.

That's where this little apple keeps my post it annoyance in check.
