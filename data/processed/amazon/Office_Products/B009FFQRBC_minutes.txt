It is about two minutes for the warmup, as advertised.I am very happy with it. It heats up very fast, being ready to use in just minutes. We timed it and it was just 3 minutes on the dot and it was ready to go! I don't believe it took the entire 5 minutes to warm up and it did an excellent job laminating my pattern. Takes five minutes to warm up then you're ready to go and laminate up to nine inches. It is ready to go in under 4 minutes and it seems feasible to laminate 10 letter sized sheets in 10 minutes. It warms up in about 5 minutes when first turned on, then it's good to go!You slip the pouch into the lip and it feeds the lamination through.. easy!I like that I am able to laminate all the way up to a 9 inch width (for a 3 mil pouch).Quality lamination also depends on the quality of the pouches, so results can vary.I use 3 mil Swingline GBC lamination pouches and haven't had any problems.I also laminated our registration for the cars (since NJ doesn't do it anymore),labels, name tags etc.I even laminated our niece's Crayon Artwork Masterpiece and it came out perfect! I let it sit for a few minutes and hit the start button and it started to flash then  the line again and then switched to &#8220;E4&#8221;. I waited for another 15 minutes and tried it again and got the same results  I looked in the user guide to see what it said and and saw no reference to E4 or any other type of error codes.Looking at the quick start guide I saw where it said at the bottom of the back page to contact customer care if E1, E2, E3, E4, E5 shows up. It heats up ready to use in just a few minutes. It takes a few minutes to warm up, but after that it's as simple as placing the item in between the sheets (which are conveniently attached together at one end.) I found that, at least when new, it only took less than 3 minutes. It heats up in just a few minutes and has enough pressure to create a perfect seal on plastified items. I've had it warm up in about 3 minutes; I just laminated some more pages and it took almost 5 minutes to warm up. It takes just about 5 minutes to warm up like the instructions say.A few things to point out:- It laminates under a minute an entire letter size document.- On and off is simple, for 3 mil or 5 mil laminating pouches.- Don't use pictures that are heat sensitive, it would change some colors - we laminated a `landscape' picture originally printed with a laser printer, and the sun turned blue.- Laminate art or documents that only have one side of the sheet printed - you'd see whatever is on the back after laminating.- If laminating small pieces, try to arrange them all in one laminating pouch - it doesn't have a release button so it would go all the way without stopping.It is very easy to use, heats up quickly, cools off in about 20 minutes, and it's a compact size. and 5 minutes for 10 mil.. It's easy to use, just turn it on and wait 5 minutes for it to warm up, place your item inside the lamination sheets and feed it through the machine. When you first turn it on it is supposed to take 5 minutes to warm up.
