When I saw this pocket, I thought it would be a great solution. Then I pressed the pocket onto them. This pocket is better suited to a document that will permanently stay inside it because it is stiff and firm. I love this durable pocket with Velcro back tabs. )The pocket itself is made of a sturdy clear plastic. I thought with the pocket, I could easily and quickly attach it to the wall and then remove it after the concerts, but the mounting fasteners are supposed to "cure" on the wall for an hour before attaching the display pocket. Since the pocket is attached to the wall with Velcro like fasteners, you could put your business license or resale permit in there for display, then if you needed to make a photo copy of it for some reason, you pull the whole pocket off the wall and copy the document while it is still in the pocket. I do think "pocket" might not be the best name for the product as that conjurs up the impression that it has some expandability to it. The pocket is made out of a rigid, durable clear plastic. It's so easy to take down the pocket and replace the drawings, then hang them right back up again.The pocket is rigid and very clear. I expect the pocket will preserve the print. With the Scotch Display pocket, 3M continues its practice of charging high prices for cheaplymanufactured plastic items. The pocket is clear, useful for displaying a single 8 1/2 x 11 in sheet of paper. The pocket works well for posting schedules, notices, and other informational items that would have to be periodically replaced or updated. To use the pocket, just attach fasteners to a wall and to the back of the pocket. Then, load the pocket with whatever and attach it to the fasteners stuck to the wall.
