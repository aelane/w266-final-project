It is certainly equivalent to any cheap white binder I might pick up at the grocery store. This binder is white as snow and just as basic as any other binder. It's a great basic binder that should work well for school or the office.No complaints to report -- it holds the paper well enough and is sturdy enough to carry around. This is an excellent basic binder. This is a plain white binder with three rings that snap open. The binder is sturdy and a convenient size to keep notebook paper in. I was satisfied with this binder. This binder also attaches with only two metal brads to the plastic spine:  I keep wondering why a third isn't added for stability. But, since this isn't the biggest binder (at 1.5 inches), it should be secure. This binder is adequate for storage only. The binder clips operated properly. This is a good binder for my needs. It's a pretty basic binder with nothing incredibly fancy. It's a good binder for the price. Their basic binder is just that - basic. This seems to be a nice, quality binder. This is a very nice, sturdy binder with solid rings that close firmly but don't try to snap your fingers off (occasionally a problem on binders this big). This is an all around amazing binder. This binder is still very strong but at a more reasonable price.It has a smooth and strong exterior with a clear cover for adding labels, decorations or pictures. Nice binder for school. This binder may not be as "heavy duty" construction as some but it is a good basic binder. This binder is 100% PVC free and "does not release harmful toxins into the air". This binder is PVC Free and the chipboard is 100% recycled with 75% post consumer waste making it a better choice for the environment.Durability seems pretty high as a opened and closed many times and tugged it here and there and it still seems to be holding up as a good as new. So far, I'm liking this binder for school use. Just you ordinary 3 ring white binder with clear cover. This binder has 3 round rings inside that have a trigger on each end to pull apart to open. I was hoping that these would be transparent, like the typical 3-ring binder. The 1 1/2" Wilson Jones 362 Basic Round Ring View Binder is a very nice binder in the world of binders. This binder also comes in a variety of colors.Wilson Jones, however, has some nicer binders, such as the D-Ring binders [Wilson Jones Heavy Duty D-Ring View Binder with Extra Durable Hinge, 1 1/2-Inch, White (W385-34WPP1)] that hold more paper than the ones with standard round rings. This binder has a light feel to it, not as solid as some other binders I've used, while it seems like it will be sufficient for ordinary uses. Nice binder, seems sturdy. Basic binder with no hidden featuers. It is a white binder with the advantage of having the plastic outside to put papers in there too. It is just a normal binder. I received this binder with a torn corner. It isn't the sturdiest binder I've ever had, but if it is going to be used for something that won't cause too much wear and tear, it would probably be okay. Interestingly, you can open this binder with either just the bottom or the top tabs, and you can close it by pinching just the bottom or the middle ring together, but you cannot close it by pinching just the top ring together - it springs back.This is pretty standard for a basic binder, and this is a fine basic binder overall. This is the standard binder that you've probably used a version of at some point. This is a three ring 1 1/2" white binder. This binder feels like it would squish more easily than most. A simple 3 ring binder, larger size. To say this binder is basic is an understatement it is stark white with a matte plastic cover that can allow custom inserts (project titles, etc.). This is a 3-ring, 2-inch binder excellent for home, office, or school use.It is well constructed of heavy cardboard covered plastic with clear plastic on front, back and side/spine so that you can add paper with information, titles, or labels to the binder without fear of the information getting damaged.I especially like the side panel/spine clear cover so that I can add a label to the spine. This helps when the binder is shelved so I can easily see what is in it without having to open it. I have this binder in the 1 1/2" White option. For them, I have found that a flexible binder in general will make it farther though the school year. Overall, this is a nice basic binder from Wilson Jones, but they do have other 1 1/2&#34; binders for a comparable price that are more heavy duty. It had never occurred to me before but I suppose the binder size refers to the height of the rings not the width of the spine.

The binder either works or it doesn't and it's either durable or it's not.

This is a very standard white, three-ring binder, exactly like the ones that I have used at work and in school over the years.

All in all, this is a decent binder, no more no less.
