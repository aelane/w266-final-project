These are quality, basic return shipping labels and I think everyone should have them. Print quality from my printer was excellent. Good quality, dependable labels, I'd recommend. A good quality product that works like it should. This has always transcended into the quality of their varied product line. These are great quality labels. When finding good quality paper and label products at affordable prices, I turn to either Avery or 3M. These are good quality permanent labels that stick well. They are a high quality product. These are also quality. Great quality, and they come in a large variety of sizes. 3M makes high quality adhesive products so you will not be disappointed with them. Cheap-o, poor quality labels can't handle multiple feeds like that -- the labels move, stick on rollers, or affix to the back sheet. They're quality, stick well, cut easily enough and are removed from the sheet easily.
