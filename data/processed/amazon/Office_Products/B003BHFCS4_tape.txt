I first encountered Post-it tape about 20 years ago when I was still working... we had an office supplies buyer that always found the latest in useful items. This is true with any tape that you tear off a roll, of course. However, I still prefer using the blue tape for extended usuage. Similarly, when I saw this tape, I wondered what I would use it for. And I hate masking tape because it's too sticky.Enter this Super Sticker Removable Label Roll. If you are looking for a masking tape like product that will not damage any surface, this is the ticket. We wound up having to use tape to stick the super sticky post-it's to the totes. Unlike tape, however, you can write on the material and you can remove the strip without damage.As others have pointed out, these are really intended for temporary labeling. The tape like dispenser works fine so it is easy to tear off a piece of Post-it as long as needed.I use thee to label folders before using a permanent label, to put under sections of a book or document I am reviewing that I can't mark with a highlighter and to put on the edge of pages with comments so I can come back to the pages easily.I can easily write on these and they don't fall off documents, folders or pages. I love this tape. I love this tape, it's just one of those little conveniences that make life more pleasant. I have been using masking tape for quite some time to mark boxes or even label my tupperware containers in the fridge.

Because it's on a tape roll, it needs to be cut or torn, and the mechanism is a jagged plastic edge on the dispenser.

I have used the tape on file folders, craft drawers, boxes, drawers on a tool chest, in the classroom to label children's mailboxes and reading boxes, learning center bins, to label reading level of books.

This is great tape!
