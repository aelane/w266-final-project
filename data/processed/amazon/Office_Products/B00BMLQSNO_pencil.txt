This is an awesome pencil sharpener. I don't know if I was holding the pencil at precisely the correct angle, or what it was.Anyway, when I saw that this "for heavy-duty use in the office or school," I jumped for it. I have returned several electric pencil sharpeners to the store in the past because they didn't produce a good sharp point or sharpen evenly. I really like this Westpoint Ipoint Curve Axis pencil sharpener. I have never seen a pencil sharpener with a seven year guarantee before. So, you can virtually sharpen the pencil with one hand. Like every one else I ran around sharpening every pencil in the house and then went out and bought some more. Just push the pencil in and you get a sharp pencil with a even point all the way around. You must take it out and look otherwise you can keep pushing the pencil in until there is nothing left. This pencil sharpener is well built and stylish. We only sharpen common pencil types (usually standard #2) for school work. It seems silly, but I really love this pencil sharpener! It then automatically stops sharpening once the pencil is sharp. As pencil sharpeners go, this model is one of Amazon's most expensive, but it seems to me that the higher cost is justified by its good performance and solid construction. It didn't sharpen evenly and got the pencil too pointy, so that the tip would break off right away. This is a decent pencil sharpener which will handle the rigors of home use, but it is not "heavy duty" enough to be school/office. The pencil shavings are neatly stored in a see thru container that easily slides out and locks back into place after emptying. The pencil sharpener gets heavily used in our household and no complaints from either myself or my kids.After several weeks of use, I highly recommend this sharpener over others! Wescott's electric pencil sharpener, the iPoint Curve Axis, is a good product, simple to use and reliable. Just hold the pencil in and when it's sharp, the machine automatically shuts off. Secondly, I like that it sharpens the pencil to a perfect point and then shuts off. I like that this pencil sharpener handles the colored pencils well. This is a very good pencil sharpener -- not too loud; gets points to just the right sharpness. We were using a small hand-held pencil sharpener that you had to manually twist the pencil in and it would often break the lead.I went crazy finding all of our pencils in the house (Basic no. I didn't feel it devoured the pencil itself while sharpening. Otherwise, this is a decent pencil sharpener. Sharpens the pencil and stops when it's done. So when the pencil is sharp, the tip trips the stop at the back of the sharpening device and it won't continue grinding. It can handle six different pencil sizes, has a carbon steel cutting blade, a larger-than-average shavings reservoir and an auto-stop feature.The iPoint Curve Axis sharpens to a point that is broader and shorter than usual, which should make the point a bit stronger and less likely to break. Is this pencil sharpener "sexy"? This pencil sharpener is the best new one I've seen in a long time. This one adjusted to multiple pencil sizes and did a great job quickly sharpening the pencils. I get frustrated using hand-held pencil sharpeners, as it seems impossible to obtain a sharp point with them. I'll always have a sharp pencil to jot down voice mail messages, make shopping lists, and work on puzzles.For the pencils I use for my artwork this Electric Pencil Sharpener isn't very impressive. Even sharpening a drawing pencil with an X-acto knife and a sand block works faster and does a better job.
