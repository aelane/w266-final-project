I have used these (5 mil) pouches with several different laminating machines, including Fellows. The 5 mil weight is fine for my purposes. The Fellowes 5 mil seems to be about the best I have tried. Now that I have sampled 5 mil, I do not think I will go back. The 5 mil sheets work great and provide a little protection to my print outs. These 5 mil pouches are very stiff, great for a menu that will be used many times per day.5 stars, does everything it is supposed to do, no exceptions. We all prefer the 5 mil pouches over the 3 mil pouches as they provide a much sturdier laminated product that holds up for repeated uses, as report covers, etc.I was a bit hesitant over the Fellowes Hot Laminating Pouches as our Fellowes Laminator is our least favorite out of our three (we use it once in a while). 5 mil thick laminating pouches are a good, all-round thickness to have. If you're interested in a 3 mil assortment, I can also recommend theFellowes Clear Laminating Pouch Assortment Kit, 3 mm, Assorted, 52 per Pack (5208401). They are 5 mil so are heavy duty and there is 150 to a box, letter size 9 inches by 11.5 inches. I prefer the 5 mil pouches to the 3 mil ones that Scotch sells. Comparing it to the Scotch 5 mil pouches, it's about the same clarity, and possibly slightly less yellowish. The 5 mil gives a nice thick result that helps prevent pages getting bent too much, as long as you have a laminator that can handle this thickness properly. These 5 mil pouches, I have no doubt, will provide exactly what you're in the market for.Doing a side-by-side comparison of the same photo printout (on standard paper) laminated in a Fellowes 5 mil pouch vs. a Fellowes 3 mil pouch, for me, there's no question that this 5 mil pouch is the one I'll opt for every time. The 5 mil pouch stiffens the page enough that, after running it through myFellowes Saturn 2 95 Laminator, 9.5-Inch (5727001), the sound it makes, when shaken, reminds me of one of those (old-fashioned?) The finished 5 mil pouch also just feels so much sturdier than the finished 3 mil pouch. You can have it with a 3 mil pouch, but those just feel thinner, cheaper, and much less durable than these 5 mil pouches do. The 5 mil definitely adds to the stiffness of your document and bonds very well without any bubbles or streaks. These 5 mil pouches are great for a hot laminator. I use these 5 mil Fellowes Hot Laminating Pouches on aFellowes Saturn SL 9.5 Inch Laminatorwith consistently good results (no bubbling or warping).Sized at around 9-1/2 x 11.5 inches, the pouches will leave a quarter inch border around a letter size document. (The 1.5 mil variety are not available on Amazon as of this writing but they are available on eBay. This 5 mil stock is perfect when you want a sturdy laminate for a document or photo. The 5 mil thickness just adds even more possibilities to your home or office needs. The 5 mil strength pouch is the mid-grade protection choice, offering stronger protection than the 3 mil pouches but still maintaining a bit of flexibility. I use this 3 mil laminating pouch in my Cosmic2 125 Fellowes laminator and find they do a very nice job. The 5 mil pouches are extremely durable and I didn't experience any bubbles in the 5 mil. Funnily, the 3 mil.
