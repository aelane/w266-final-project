It makes a near perfect point every time. It is a usable point, but obviously not perfect. After sharpening, the point is still a bit dull - not perfect. For a perfect point try this very easy (and cheap) manual sharpener:Kum Long Point Pencil Sharpener with Pointer3. My point being that this unit blows all of them away.It resembles a locomotive from the old days, or a piece of field artillery... BIG. It does have a fine point sensor, eating pencils a bit until they are super sharp, and the auto switch can be fooled not to start if you place the pencil in the hole lifted up to much. Also, the point is not very sharp, either. So far it has prevented any point breaking or that grinding on and on that can quickly shorten the life of a pencil.

It also may explain why the Westcott Axis constantly creates a smooth point, both along the wood and graphite, while the portable and admittedly less expensive unit creates gashes, gouges, and all too often results in broken points.The third thing I noticed was how easily it sharpened a pencil...Between its weight and rubber feet, this sharpener sits solidly on my desk.

Or the point was uneven.

It wasn't unusual that I would have to grind and grind to finally get an acceptable point on a brand new pencil, at the expense of  the pencil length.Enter this sharpener - it is work of pencil sharpening perfection.
