This is a great pen that came in handy across the board. This pen is great! Otherwise, I really love this Zebra pen! This is a nice pen, writes about like other gel pens I have used. I wouldn't buy this pen at this price or the higher prices  if you compare what they sell for.For me, this just shouldn't command such a high price. The pen writes well, as I'd expect from a Zebra product, and the stylus works nicely on my iPad. The pen is also good quality and writes well. It's a nice looking pen that writes well and also has  a tip you can use for a tablet or cell phone. What can you say about a pen...? The pen is smooth writing with dark black ink and I like that it opens and retracts with a slide button on the top of the clip instead of fumbling with a screw cap. Perfectly portable pen on one side, stylus on the other. The pen is also easy to refill. This stylus pen is a great idea. This pen is different from most pens in that it has a rubber stylus on one end you can use for your smartphone or tablet pc.Of course the other end is a regular pen and has black ink.It writes well and is pretty comfortable in your hand also.The pocket clip extends the pen tip by using your thumb to push it towards the tip of the pen.Its a nice pen and isn't to expensive.I hope my review helps you in choosing this. This pen is great considering the price and function. This is a very nice pen. Overall I really like this pen and will be looking at the fine point version next time I'm in the market. How often do we need a pen? I fully enjoy using this pen and will wear its cartridge out faster than many other ones. This pen is pretty cool. When I first went to use this, the pen would not write. The pen is refillable with ZEBRA's StylusPen RTLV Ink Refill Item #86812; just unscrew the tip of the pen to refill. The pen currently has the greatest appeal for me, although I'm discovering that the stylus has some very helpful features as well. It's comfortable to hold and use as a pen, well balanced and smooth writing. This is a fairly good pen, comfortable in the hand, maybe a little short, with an even black flow of ink. This is an excellent, inexpensive pen and stylus. Both the pen and the stylus work fine; I really have no complaints. The pen is just as smooth as advertised, but I find there is such a thing as TOO smooth. First off, this is my first Stylus pen. When I first ordered this pen I thought that the pen and stylus were on the same end (just switchable), but really this is just a pen with a stylus on the other end. I didn't think it matter much, a pen is a pen right? But I really like this pen. This pen is now permanently ensconced in my purse. Now, when I reach in, I pull out just what I need, since it is both a pen and a stylus.The stylus is a nice soft rubber tipped one that is touchscreen smartphone and tablet compatible. What I like best about this pen is that it is re-fillable, meaning when the ink runs out, I don't get stuck with just a stylus- it will always be a space saving pen and stylus combined in one. The pen is fairly thick in your hand. Really nice Stylus pen!The Gel writes very smooth, flows evenly.The pen part has a ribbed rubber grip that feels good in your hand.It's not &#34;top heavy&#34;There's a clip that also works as the &#34;click&#34; to move the pen in/out of the pen.Stylus part works on iphone, tablet and Kindle HD.A very looking Stylus pen.

The pen is retractable via the pocket clip, since the end is the stylus.

The pen, on the other hand?

The stylus pen is a medium ball point (1.0mm) with black ink that thankfully -  being a left hand dragging print muddler - dries on contact.
