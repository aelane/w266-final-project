I also like that the paper is stored underneath the unit, not sticking out in the open where my kiddos have learned to snag it. The paper drawer has three tabs on the back that could break off easily if mishandled. The paper all loads from the front and print output comes out the front. The paper tray, when inserted, is flush with the front of the printer (this is an excellent choice, since most printers have an ugly tray that sticks out the front). The paper tray is a bit delicate, there are three sliding bars to align for the paper and you aren't supposed to get the paper past the rear arrow.To connect the printer to a wireless network, enter the setup mode from the front panel, and follow the prompts for Setup Wizard. The Epson NX625 has a generous paper tray and is a solidly built unit. You have to empty the paper tray, reset the alignment clips, and then it still couldn't print a single envelope. I used photo paper and the image is crisp and clear. No flipping paper over or waiting for the second side to print. I'm also not sure if paper jams will be more frequent now.The NX625 is also an all-in-one printer. Changing the paper in the tray and having to adjust the guide rails fills me with fear of breaking it.-Was hoping to assign it an IP address through the printer's display setup, but looked like it was DHCP or nothing. Interestingly, the paper tray is a tray, it's a cartridge that you pull completely out to reload. It was the paper feeding mechanism that seemed to generate most of the noise, unlike my old Stylus 800 where the printhead sounded like a machine gun. I thought I had run out of paper, but to my surprise it had completed the print job.The scanner and copying features also work great.For the price you really can't find a better deal. The paper tray is flimsy, but it works and holds enough paper that it's not always running out.
