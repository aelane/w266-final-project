I can't ask for more for a binder! I would opt for a cheaper binder. But this binder will accomodate inserts of 1" width for the spine and 9.5" width for the front cover.SIZE: 10.25" x 11.5" Easily accommodates 8.5 x 11" sheets.QUALITY: The quality is the same as other quality binders. The binder rings are quality metal, and the binder clips are the smaller size but appropriate for a 1" binder. This binder is more sturdy and flexible. The binder is lightweight but does not feel flimsy at all.Very professional looking product. So as long as the binder is never turned over you will be okay.The quality of these binders seems to be pretty good. The binder fits nicely in the music rack and lays flat. What makes this binder different from any other binder is simple the clear plastic cover that you slip a spine label into. Now turn the binder upside down and watch the spine insert immediately slip out. Speedy Spine Binders come to a little over $6 per binder, which is expensive compared to the regular 1" binders that you can pick up at a big box store or on Amazon. If you need a top-quality binder with easy-to-insert cover/spin, and are willing to pay a few dollars more than average, this is a good choice.As other reviewers have pointed out, the rings are mounted on the back cover, instead of along the spine, making it easier to accommodate insertions. I have one binder in the laundry room for all of my laundry appliances. If you're ever fought with a binder in an attempt to insert a labeled spine - you will definitely appreciate this improvement.The 1" binders have the traditional Round Rings (rather than the D-Ring). If you want a binder that can be quickly changed for presentations it's a terrific idea, and I recommend a slightly heavier paper weight for any spine uses, I found that they stayed better for me.I personally wouldn't recommend this style for school aged children since it can't hold very much but would definitely recommend the brand for sturdiness and quality. Overall, a well built binder that's made in the US (I do like to try and buy American made when I can and if you feel the same it's worth noting). I would not recommend this binder unless you have money to burn. I did not include how long that took in the binder loading process.That said, these are actually really nice binders.

I normally pay from $1 - $4 for each binder, depending on what I am using it for.

The 1-inch binder keeps all pages in place when the binder is fully loaded and upright.

A binder is a binder, but this binder in particular has some not-so-invisible features that really make a difference in efficiency.For me, personally, I really like the fact that the rings are mounted on the back lid, rather than on the spine.
