Of ALL the mechanical pencils I have used in the last 20 years, I finally realized that no other pencil even comes near as good. These pencils were a revelation; the lead rarely if ever breaks, and they feel more like an ordinary pencil in your hand than some of the super-thin mechanical pencils out there. These pencils are great. Overall, I love these pencils and will continue to use them as long as they are around. These pencils are terrific. I really like to use mechanical pencils when I am doing design and draft work. Unfortunately they seem to get lost or borrowed often, so I like to buy them in quantity.Other mechanical pencils have the more convenient finger click lead-advance button, but have that inconvenient covered micro eraser and are much more expensive.These have the less convenient twist lead-advance system, but have superior large no-smudge erasers with no cumbersome cover and are much less expensive.For my needs, these win. I'll never go back to plain pencils or any other mechanical pencil. Other mechanical pencils that you push the top to advance the lead don't allow you to decide how much lead you want exposed. With these pencils you can decide how long or short you want the lead. Simple lightweight retactable pencils at a great price. Are there better pencils on the market?
