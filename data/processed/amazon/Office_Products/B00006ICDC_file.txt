I love that this file holder has 20 pockets, marked for A-Z, and is of a large size to accommendate your needs. As I'm keeping it in a file drawer, it should be fine and handle the wear I give it. This is a useful expanding file for my office. I needed a file folder to use to organize paperwork. The file that I'm reviewing is made of paper material and each individual folder/compartment is rather narrow, so this is good if you are not looking to file big stacks of documents. This expanding file folder holds A LOT of papers. If you're looking for a basic accordion/expandable file, this may fit. Opening the file necessitates bending the top, yanking the top, pulling the top - all resulting in some frustration and creases in the top. The file is flexible and sturdy enough for the purpose I have assigned it. This is a nice expanding file that seems to be well made, except that the flap is too thin and bendy. Handy and useful file but we will see how sturdy it is with lots of use. This expanding file folder is pre-labeled A-Z on 21 pockets. This file organizer is great. Since there isn't much in my file at the moment (largely because I'm still figuring out wher to put everything without making me batty), the Velcro strip isn't much of an issue, but I could see that as it fills, it may become less of a closure at all, for one, and for two, it may not survive many openings and closings as I add paid bills or other important papers several times a month. So if you don't open and close this file frequently, then this would be fine. But if this file has heavy usage, I don't think it will last as long because of the velcro fastener creasing/bending the top flap. This is a very nice file folder if you are looking for an alphabetical (NOT MONTHLY) file folder. There is a file for A to Z. Still a very sturdy file folder I would recommend. This file system deserves a better lid. What can one  say about an expanding file? I think that the file itself is fairly heavy duty, I've had files with thinner outer walls, so I think that the quality is good, the walls on the inside of the file aren't heavy duty, but I suppose it's not needed there and the flap is not thick. But really, the file feels like it will last through any abuse I put it through for the next few years.I say that it's worth it and I'd recommend it. I like it much better than a traditional brown expanding file, BUT my excitement toned down immediately when I tried to open the as yet unused product and the velcro was so tight that I almost ripped the flimsy folding flap getting it separated. It might be an expanding file, but each section does not allow for more than a few sheets of paper because when they are all filled the file itself is too bulky and the already flimsy flap barely closes and then there is the problem with the super velcro. I am using the file in a desk drawer just as it is for filing daily paperwork I need. This expandable file is sturdy and well constructed. Love this file for my yearly expenses. I highly recommend this expendable file and give it five stars and a big thumbs up!
