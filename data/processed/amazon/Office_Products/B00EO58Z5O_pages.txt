I inserted the pages upside down and backwards and pressed the little blue button. It was super easy to blast through pages and pages. I rarely had any pages mangled with it. I would say they are about the same, overall.- After scanning about 45,000 pages with it (I pushed it well beyond the 3,000 per day it says it can do), I can also say that it is a durable product. It is only 26 pages per minute (as it claims) if you are only doing 26 pages! * Epson scans 26 pages per minute and ScanSnap at 25 ppm. So it sucked up my 8 pages (double-sided) and spit out a PDF on my laptop. Then it fed the pages through very quickly, scanning both sides of the page in one pass. So, rather than flip all of the pages in my reader, I just re-scanned them and placed them in the feeder upside down.Overall, this a flexible, easy to use scanner that does a quality scanning job and it offers flexible DPI and file format saves. Photocopied pages similarly so. I easily got the rated 26 pages per minute on the 190 page report that I scanned. The pages were punched for a comb binding (19 rectangular holes in the side) and the corners were dog-eared.
