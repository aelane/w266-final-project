It also has Tare (to zero out the scale if a carton is placed on it first) and Hold modes.The thing I like about this scale is the fact that it separates the weighing platform from the weight readout. If you need a versatile scale I can recommend this.Pros:* Accurate, can be calibrated easily* Hold function to let you lock your weight readings* Separate weighing platform and readout makes it convenient to use* Weighs up to 110 pounds* Tare mode* Display can be wall mounted* Included AC adapter* Included AAA batteries* Solid construction, well made* Two year warrentyCons:* NoneWhile I was provided with a free sample it did not influence my recommendation. A postal scale has almost become a necessity.=== The Good Stuff ===* The unit is a nice size. * The scale works either on AC power or 2 AAA batteries. I have my scale on a shelf, and there is no wall space available nearby to mount the display. It is also very convenient to have the scale separate from the display screen so you can have the scale where you need it and install the display where it can easily be read. This postal scale accomplishes that by giving accurate readings on packages but also being compact enough that it doesn't take up unnecessary space.Whether you are shipping envelopes or boxes, Smart Weight has created something that will meet your needs at a price that is perfect for someone growing a business or a brand. Highly recommended.Smart Weigh provided me with a scale for the purposes of this review. The scale is already calibrated which is another plus (the scale does have auto calibration). The scale is very easy to set up and use - just turn it on and put the package or envelope on itThe Smart Weigh ACE 110 Shipping Postal Scale does a great job.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this product for free. Still the same:  This scale registers only whole ounces from 10 to 15. My scale was off over a pound (underweight, as in negative numbers, when nothing was sitting on it). The scale consists of a small platform that is sturdy enough even to hold an oversized box, and a remote control/display attached with something similar to a curled telephone handset cable. This is the second Smart Weigh scale I've been asked to give an unbiased review for in exchange for a free scale, and I have to say that I'm very impressed with their products. Even though this scale is specified for weighing items for postage and shipping, it is adaptable for many uses. This is a really nice scale for small business or personal use. The scale can be tarred (zeroed out) with something on it.My checks of weight were accurate to the ability of the scale.You can run the scale display off of AC using the power cord or batteries.I was provided a sample for evaluation and review. So, I didn't formally calibrate the scale, but if used as directed on a flat surface (same directions for ALL my scales by the way) it consistently gives the same readings and agrees with my other scales. We needed an accurate scale to determine shipping rates.This is perfect for this. For a scale that will weigh packages up to 110 pounds, it's surprisingly accurate at the low end, measuring in 1/10 ounce increments. The scale is portable and can be carried to the object being weighed. I know what I am looking for and what I expect in a scale. This one somewhat my expectations.The scale has 4 components: the scale, the 'computer monitor', the AC adapter and an expandable telephone cord. The scale provided accurate and consistent readouts.What I do not like about this scale is that it is in 2 parts. The scale was accurate even when the weighed object was set on just one corner of the platform. The scale uses 2 AAA batteries (included) that are installed in the display part of the unit. Easy to read, accurate &#8211; just exactly what a postal scale needs to be. Easy to read, accurate &#8211; just exactly what a postal scale needs to be. Easy to read, accurate &#8211; just exactly what a postal scale needs to be. This scale comes with a fairly large platform (8 inch by 8 inch) which will meet almost all my needs.The display is easy to read. The scale uses AA batteries or can use an outlet. The scale goes up to 110 pounds, so you could end up with a reasonably sized box on the scale without any display issues.The display unit is also well-thought out for needs and use cases. When asked to review this scale, I almost declined because while we do mail a good number of packages for our business, most of them go US Priority Mail, so weight doesn't matter. The more I thought about though, the more I realized this scale would come in handy as more than a postage scale.The separate display and ability to choose between using battery and outlet power make this thing very versatile. It&#8217;s described as a postal scale, but is perfectly capable of handling most other smaller sized items, up to around 110 pounds. I agreed and they shipped the little scale to me.The packaging was good, it was well protected from any shipping damage. You can use the scale in a location without electricity by turning on the unit using only the batteries.I measured a multitude of items on the scale to see it's accuracy and was pleasantly surprised that this small scale weighed everything within very acceptable tolerances.
