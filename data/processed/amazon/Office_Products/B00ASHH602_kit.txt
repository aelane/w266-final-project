This kit contains the label maker, 2 full-size cartridges (one blue, one white), and a nice, sturdy plastic carrying case (and, of course, a user's guide).This kit will print up to 150 labels. I thought this would be a fun kit but I had no idea how useful it could be. A kit is supposed to work out of the box, so you can enjoy the fun of immediate label satisfaction. What this kit lacks is power. The kit came with everything I needed to get started . The kit can be powered by batteries or a power cord. This is a great little kit to keep your clothing organized and from getting lost.Many times you send your clothing away to be laundered or dry-cleaned, and you risk them being lost. I thought this was a specific kit that does only iron ons. if you want to pass on buying the kit. The kit the I have is the iron-on,  it comes with a white and blue labels. The kit is more expensive than purchasing the labels and printer individually, but you get a carrying case. This kit contains the Epson LW-300 label maker and two, iron-on tape cartridges - blue and black. When we first received the kit I thought it would be a bit complicated for easy use, since it has many settings, fonts and symbols to print. Great little kit for creating iron-on name tags for kids' clothing, jerseys, etc. The LW-300 "kit" includes a carry case that can hold two label/ink cartridges in addition to one installed in the unit. The LW-300 kit featured here includes two cartridges. On Amazon the kit cost less than purchasing either label printer separately and two fabric cartridges -- but that's only a savings if you will use the two included cartridges. The kit I received includes a silver and light blue fabric. But if you can use them, the kit is cheaper than buying the items separately.
