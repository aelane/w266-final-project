This printer is a very good choice for the small workgroup that needs a printer with large capacity input bins, or who needs the multiple bins for different size paper. As near as I can tell, the printer is actually the exact same model as the 4530 except that this model sits on top of a second input tray. I chose to connect the printer to the network via the front panel and then just install the software. The printer supports the standard wireless security, and it is easy to set up.The print output is very nice. This can be changed via the printer or windows settings.The new ink cartridge design is simply outstanding. Probably think twice before you purchaseThis work pro printer would certainly be at home in a small office environment, and I suspect that for home use will be limited to those people with plenty of space, or who have excessive printing needs.With a second paper drawer base that the unit sits on top of, it holds up to 580 sheets of paper (less if using various sizes) and includes the two drawers to separate legal, letter or A4 for example.Set up is easy with the included DVD and instructions, once connected the printer takes about 12 minutes to run through it's initial set up programming.Connection is wireless, wired via USB, or wired via Printer cable - a word of warning - there is NO printer cable supplied??? Exactly how much do you need to spend on a printer to get a cable included?Most will use it for wireless, so I suppose it's a moot point, I just find it annoying.Wireless setup was very easy, all done through the large touch screen front panel, and it's fairly idiot proof.I'm not personally using the FAX function so can't comment on that, but I do like that when you access printer preferences from your PC, you get a separate menu for fax preferences from the main menu for the standard options like print quality etc.It's BIG, no other word for it, it stands over 17" high on my file cabinet next to my desktop PC and almost 18" wide, and 16" deep - worth remembering if you have limited space.It's VERY FAST, the fastest I've used for an inkjet, but considering the cost that's probably not surprising.Two sided printing is also nice for any projects, and is simply a click of the mouse to change.Copying is Photocopy style with a auto feed slot on top, scanning documents requires the lid to be lifted.I have not had chance yet to go into ALL of the features the printer offers, but the Amazon and Epson description above is pretty detailed.It takes 4 INK cartridges (included) and at time of writing this review, replacements are not available yet to buy online, even from Epson directly, I suspect because this is a very new model. I used the printer over the wireless network exclusively, and was able to join my secured network quickly and easily. The printer and copier functions can both duplex. We have had this printer for several weeks now and it prints flawlessly. This printer pretty much does it all from printing, copying, faxing....you name it and it does it and does it well. Overall we are very happy with this printer and would recommend it to family and friends......and isn't that the real test with a product review...:-) I got this printer two months ago for a project, which required color printing. This printer is a large, ugly beast, but it's the best beast I've ever owned (not including my dog). This printer is a great value. I am not a printer engineering expert but I feel reasonably sure that the feature of being able to do both automatic duplexing in copying, scanning, and scanning as compared to copying only in the 840 requires the additional hardware and heft to accomplish it. This printer does so much, I had to start taking notes.First, it is bigger, heavier, and more durable that I originally thought. After trying to set up the printer using the wrong slot, I was frustrated. The printer talks to the computer through wifi. It turns out that this printer -- the top of Epson's line of all-in-ones -- is incapable of printing in true "borderless" mode. I'm setting the printer up. The printer's connected, installed, and works great. So let's talk about the actual printer now.This is a pretty big unit, but its footprint is almost exactly the same as the HP 7580 it's replacing; it's just taller because of the second feed tray, an option that's also available on that HP model. I selected this printer because I do a lot of volunteer work for the local animal shelter and this printer does a good job replicating my photographs for flyers on plain paper. I do not use a printer much.PRO:Fast and quiet.Great colorCON:Build feels a bit cheap with plastic parts for the body.HeavyInsists on printing in color even when the "B&W;" button is pressed before printing.This printer came in a huge box, well-protected from harsh treatment. I thought I was upgrading to a better printer when I chose the WP-4540 to replace my 840. I think the printer that is half the price is a better printer.The wp4540 has two paper drawers but it's default setting is the paper loaded in the slot in the back, which doesn't hold 500 sheets. I've never had a printer with a leaking cartridge before.There are more settings for different size papers for the wp4540 than the 840 but they aren't all available for the pre-programmed settings. I'm sure this is a decent printer, but I couldn't get it to work on my wireless network. I did not hook the printer up directly to a computer to test it because I specifically needed a wireless printer. Besides, I believe a printer that's advertised as "wireless" should indeed perform wirelessly. I have a Canon printer that isn't even billed as a wireless printer that I have been able to set up to work wirelelssly. The Epson WP-4540 is a great printer. I will say that is far more reliable that my other printer, HP 6500 All in One.The thing that impressed me the most is during the warranty period the tray that holds paper as it comes out of the printer broke. The printer has an 80-sheet rear-feed tray for envelopes, labels and card stock.Display is a 5.8" smart touch panel with a 3.5% LCD screen and menus are very intuitive and easy to navigate through.It prints 16 black pages per minute and 11 color pages per minute and the ink dries instantly.The only things you need to buy to start using the printer immediately is paper and USB cable if you don't have a wired Ethernet connection or WiFi. The printer definitely seems geared to the home-office market because the build quality would not stand up to the abuse that a larger office would inflict on it. ; I'm happy to get rid of my old Brother printer. I am going to discuss what bothered me first about this printer and then go into what I like about it. Ironically, the printer ended up being named FAX and my  FAX is now named DUN. This printer, right out of the box, looks like it means business. The printer is simple to put together, you almost don't need the instruction. The printer then went through initialization; you can go get a cup of coffee at this point because it takes quite long with a lot of loud noise. You then need to install the printer driver on your PC, I installed it on my Mac. This printer could easily serve a small office with 10-15 users. My old printer didn't do it, so I would have to figure out reverse order and which side was "up" and all of that nonsense. When I received this printer, I soon realised that it was too much machine for my small house and needs. I really like this printer, I find it easy to use, the print looks very clear whether it's in color or black and white, and it works great as a copier, a scanner and as a fax machine as well. I was able to explain to her how to use this printer's copy functions and had her make some copies of papers she needed for a class she teaches. She was very impressed with this printer - high praise from her.So far I cannot find too much to fault with this printer. The printer is a nice size so you will need a bit of space to operate it comfortably. This printer has a huge paper capacity, so there is an extra paper bin that attaches to the bottom of the printer; I opted not to use this, for now, since it would elevate the printer higher than I have access to.After you plug the printer in you add the four ink cartridges, which are rather interesting looking because they are big clear boxes. The printer then goes through a 12 minutes ink adjustment.After this you install the installation CD when it says to. An excellent printer with  long lasting ink cartridges, even the ones that come with the unit that are never really full of ink.Shakes a lot before and during printing.Scan feature freezes up in Photoshop. The printer was not installed with a password, never even prompted for one. This printer takes up quite a bit of space and is very heavy. It's really, amazingly big for a printer, but you have to remember it's an all-in-one. The printer cable is not included. They do print fairly fast, but they don't fly out of the printer like in the video.- Noisy. This is a big printer. I can't stand my current printer because I have to split up a ream since it only holds a couple hundred sheets. I don't have much to say here because this printer seems so solid in that area. We can all print to this printer and have had no problems at allFirst thing you will notice is that the box is BIG! The printer weighs 36.5 pounds without paper. I would say this printer is best for high volume, text- based documents that have color components and the occasional photo printing for personal use. Your printer is available to you wherever you are. I've been using this printer for months and it works as well today as it did the first day. The printer is bigger and much heavier than listed in this section. It can be hooked up directly to a printer, to a wired network, or with wifi. My Cannon printer, which is still being sold, cost about 40 percent of what this one does. My HP printer is not being sold anymore and isn't really comparable to this Espon unit. But I like what this printer can do for me ... five stars.JAN 30, 2013 UPDATE:  My printer recently began bleeding yellow ink on every printed page. I called Epson, and they sent me a refurbished printer at no cost, and a shipping label so I could return my old printer to them, again at no cost, as well as throwing in a set of ink cartridges. Since my printer is over two years old and well out of warranty, I was afraid I'd be told I was out of luck, even if this was a defect, vice normal wear and tear. This has been the best printer I've ever owned, and I'm glad to see such good customer support. This is a very large printer - you should know that up front.
