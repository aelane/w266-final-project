Each pencil has two erasers; once one of the erasers is finished, you simply pop the eraser holder out and turn it upside down to expose a new eraser. The pencil has a nice weight to it without being heavy or too light. The pencil line is smooth and easy. I love the pencil grips at the ends to make it easy to hold. Each pencil has its own eraser plus it also has two extra erasers, which are really four, since the erasers have two ends that flip. I know exactly where the pencil is in my bag and in the jar on my desk. I hate when a mechanical pencil tries to look like a real pencil. But I think I found a new pencil, after years of devotion to another Paper Mate pencil- the TopNotch grip. When I got these, I wondered what could be so great about them--after all, isn't a mechanical pencil just another mechanical pencil? I never met a lead pencil I liked untill now. Whenever I've used a  Bic  pencil the lead broke off as soon as soon as I put any pressure on it. I thank Amazon for having this for me to try and making me into a lead pencil convert.UPDATE:Sept.25,2012 We liked these pencils so much I just received my reorder of 12 more. They write smoothly and the pencil marks erase easily. The pencil could mark every type of paper I tried, and the eraser worked on all but one: the Amazon packing slip that came with the order. The pencil is the perfect size, not too big and not too small. This pencil writes so smoothly, like I'm writing with satin lead. Yes, I like this pencil set. With an ordinary pencil, the eraser soon gets blackened to the point where it is unusable. The pencil lead wears down and I have to make a trip to another room, plug in an electric sharpener, etc., to get it working again.Not anymore. This fine mechanical pencil gives you just the right amount of lead and the eraser is a wonder. But it works as stated and has a few nice features.First and foremost it works well as a mechanical pencil. The #2 pencil leads will comply with the demands of most elementary schools and standardized tests (will the SAT ever go electronic?). Overall, the pencil seems durable enough for a throw-away and the package comes with some extra leads and eraser sets so they will probably last a good long time.As an adult, I prefer a more permanent solution, but for my kids--who love these kinds of pencils but also have a knack for losing them, it's nice to have a quality, throw-away option. I like this pencil. So, a fine pencil, plus at back to school time extra nice for schoolkids. The pencil part is nice and the lead seems to be sturdy and easy to use. I've been using the Paper Mate pencil's for a while now, the Soft Grip model is the one that I've been using but, this new Quick Flip is even better and I'll be switching to this version.I collect pens and pencils that cost a lot but I take these out of the house because I don't want to lose a pricy pen or pencil.I find myself scattering these Paper Mates around the house, near every phone and action areas of the house because these newer Paper Mate pens and pencils are handy.This pencils do the job and if someone walks off with one, I can live with it...These new Quick Flip pencils work really great and look very cool too.Extra Erasers and leads included! The pencil itself writes smoothly, and I didn't have any problems with excessive breakage. BUT the mechanical pencil must have a nice grip and feel comfortable when writing to pass muster. The pencil feels really nice in my hand. The pencil feels ready to just write, even with the lead advancer at the top compared to the side one of my favorite mechanical pencil.The double flip eraser is definitely handy. It's difficult to get excited over a pencil, but this works as expected. This pencil is very comfortable to hold and the lead is dark! I tend to grip a pencil with too much pressure when writing so I really appreciated this.The pencil writes clearly and the eraser cleans up almost perfectly. Overall, the Paper Mate Quick Flip 0.7MM pencil writes fairly well and the eraser works just fine. Granted there are not exactly the same, one is a 0.7MM pencil while the other is a 0.9MM pencil so perhaps this is not a fair comparison. The Paper Mate pencil set works well. Fortunately, each pencil has two erasers (one unit, flipped up-side-down to reveal the second eraser) and there are also two additional eraser units included. Additional pencil lead is also included.If you like the colors and don't expect to use the eraser much, you will probably be very happy with this product. However, if you don't have a pencil sharpener at the ready, these are perfect. I'm not normally a mechanical pencil person. If you're used to using a traditional pencil, you may just become a convert like me! With no pencil sharpening and always an eraser at hand, you do have the perfect pencil.This Paper Mate Quick Flip Mechanical Pencil Starter Set is a great buy. Simply click the pencil and new lead appears. These are definitely recommended if you want to try a new mechanical pencil and tend to do a lot of erasing. You know what I mean, the mechanical pencil feels good when you write with it. Each pencil comes with a double ended eraser.
