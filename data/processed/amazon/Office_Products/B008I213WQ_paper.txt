The paper quality is not so good, and the template doesn't print perfectly. The paper feels sort of like a thin cardstock, which did not get stuck in our printer. Very sturdy paper and very easy to print and assemble. The paper is a 65 lb weight, which is a nice thickness for tickets. This paper is compatible with both ink jet and laser printers. The paper itself is nice, but the online print service is amazing. The paper is high quality and the online print document program is easy to use and design with (easier than WORD in my opinion). She liked the paper that they were printed on and the easy tear stubs. The paper stock is fairly light compared with similar "Admit One" products - it feels extremely flimsy and the tear-off stub gets damaged easily. Being that we did not need archival paper, but rather a more disposable product to be printed on an inkjet printer, this fit the bill. And the paper stock, while rigid, is not as thick as would be ideal either. Just make sure if you use these you are watching and guiding the paper into the printer and fold the tickets on the perforations to ensure a clean tear, with those tips these are a really useful product. The paper stock is high quality with easy tear perforations that don't look like a jagged mess. The paper hold the ink well and the results are professional looking and do not smudge. The paper is of a good thickness, though this can be an issue for older printers. You'll have to print on plain paper of course, but it will give you an idea what to expect when you buy the product.
