I still gave this a 5-star because the print quality is excellent. I LOVE the CD/DVD print option. There is a PDF print workaround, but it is very limited. No more print trays left open collecting dust. I compared a print I made with this printer with one from Sam's Club I had done the other day on their fancy photo machines. Text print quality is "ok", not as good as the Brother laser. Photo print quality is good, but honestly, for most photo printing I prefer to use Costco's $30,000 in house printer and use a home $100 printer when needed periodically.Scanning worked very well. I am very pleased with the print quality of documents and especially of photos. More astonishing, though, is the print speed - my photo emerged from the printer in roughly 20 seconds, making this one of the fastest color printers I have used for printing photos.I then decided to scan an image with the printer. Also, print from an application in which you can choose the profile for that paper (ex: many Adobe products) if possible, too. Air print from an Ipad worked flawlessly. Air print really works well and makes printing from IOS devices easy (also uses Google Cloud print)..
