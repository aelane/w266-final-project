I bought this printer for two main reasons - the wireless printing and the CD/DVD printing. Wireless scanning also works well and is quick.So yes, overall I am fairly happy with this printer. I have the printer sitting about 6 feet away from my (very cluttered) desktop. I did that, but the printer would still not print wirelessly (no error message, but no output). I tried this printer after being a satisfied user of the older (but similarly priced) Canon MP620. One printer wasn't enough though and so the Artisan 710 seemed like an ideal addition at a lower cost. I love this printer. This printer failsover day or so - we partially resolvedthe problem by pulling the power cord fromthe wall and re-starting this cumbersome printer.Finally, the final 4th printer (after workingfine for 4 months) is blinking the same errormessage that the previous printer did.This monster has bad quality control issues.The paper tray is horribly designed and sitsfar to close to the receiving paper tray thatis so flimsy, it broke off on two of our printers.Paper jams are frequent on these printers, andcan only print on thin papers. The printer needs a baby sitterif you send a print job consisting of more than 1 page.The CD Tray is way too flimsy. This is my first Epson printer since I bought a laser printer maybe 15 years ago. It removes completely from the printer, but it's a baffling, sliding mess of chintzy plastic. Come to find out, THERE IS NO BLUETOOTH on this printer!
