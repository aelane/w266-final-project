This thing is just too big for a regular person's desk and more fitting to be in some kind of industrial fabrication plant. The thing is huge and takes up way too much space on my desk, I don't like the legs at all, they are not sturdy and I feel that they should have been made all one piece (like a frame) and then attach to the plastic holder. As much as this thing costs, a cheap case (to keep the legs from flopping around and to give it some protection) would have been a nice touch.So who would need this thing? This thing is HUGE. This thing works great for 2 things.1. This thing fits perfectly on a TV tray or tabletop and holds the iPad perfectly. )Overall, I love this thing! The bad thing is I had to call them because the instruction manual is just three doubel sided sheets of paper listing diagrams on how to put together three types of document holders with some safety and warranty information and a parts list thrown in. Same thing for cookbooks...  annoys the heck out of me to prop up a large cookbook and weigh the pages down so they won't turn (not that I cook all that often, but when I do I'd rather focus on cooking and not figuring mucking about with the book).While this product is huge, it is what is needed for large cookbooks. I guess I really didn't realize just how big this thing is.

Only a thing band hides the text.Quality materials.Sits comfortably at desk and holds the book where you can read it.CONSIt's definitely big and a bit deep, so get out a measuring tape and visualize the dimensions on your desk.

One thing to remember, though: keep the box it comes in!

It's a pretty heavy and awkwardly shaped thing to keep set-up all the time unless it's always being used.
