This binder is made from recycled materials, which is already a bonus. While I applaud Wilson Jones for producing a recyclable binder made of mostly repurposed material, it does have a down side. Overall, nice 1 inch ring binder with the benefit of being recycled. But it is a pretty sturdy binder and does what a binder should do -- binds paper. This binder is made of recycled materials and able to be recycled once you are finished with it. I honestly don't think it will be nowhere near as durable as a plastic binder. Other than that, it is just a 3 ring binder with no pockets. This is an excellent binder for a high-schooler who loves to draw/doodle. One can cover this binder in doodles and drawings and really make it one's own. (Our binder arrived with a greasy fingerprint smudged across the cover ... it does not wash off (obviously)). This binder not only contains recycled material, but it has a beautiful, smooth finish. I have to either write directly on the binder or tape my own design on it.This one-inch binder &#8220;comfortably&#8221; holds a 200-sheet package of Mead wide ruled filler paper. I can see this binder lasting as long as many other bonders.The Wilson Jones Recycled Binder, not being three cardboard segments wrapped in a plastic liner, has the advantage of single-piece, completely writable surface, which is perfect for those who enjoy adding an artistic touch to their binder. This binder is also slightly smaller that the traditional wrapped binder, in that the added border of the plastic wrapped binders add about five-eighths of an inch of dimension from back to front; it's not much, but when going into and out of a stuffed book bag, it is easy to recognize how nice it is to have a compact binder like this one.The recycled binder is an excellent choice. This binder is great for personal use, but I don't think it would provide the presentation necessary for a business (unless it's a home-base business centered on something craftsy). I definitely wouldn't choose this as a binder for school, as I don't think the material would hold up well to constantly going in and out of a backpack. Wilson Jones Resource Recycled Binder is a very nice, aesthetically pleasing looking binder. The binder looks and feels like very thick quality cardboard. This would be a nice binder to get if you're an artist who likes to doodle, as the material allows for drawings with pens and sharpies. This binder also looks to have potential to get worn down much quicker than plastic binders (but it also looks a lot prettier than those plastic monstrosities!) Overall, this is a nice binder to have to use for work or school. This is a strong, really well built binder that I'm using to display my photographs and I am really happy with it.I like the recycle project this company is doing, making quality binders to use and recycle and the binder is really nice.These are really good! Overall I'm very satisfied with this binder. It's a binder so here is the breakdown of my binder experience. Once you take it off, the binder is a very plain, brown binder.What it is GREAT for is drawing. If you leave it alone, you can have a very professional looking binder, but if you have an artistic flair, you can draw and color til your heart's content. This binder has traditional circle rings on the inside (as opposed to &#34;D-shaped&#34; rings), but they function well. The binder is more durable than you'd expect, but I have noticed that it starts looking ragged more quickly than our plastic binders. I like how this binder looks and feels, along with the thought behind it. The binder looks one of the plainest binder I have ever seen, but it is also wonderously beautiful in its own right. A binder is one of the least likely products someone would buy and throw away a few week, months or even years later. IMHO this binder is actually WORSE for the environment because if you get it wet it will be destroyed and you'll have to throw it away (recycle it), something you would not have to do with an ordinary binder. I like that this binder makes use of recycled materials. Because the binder has a Kraft paper type of feel, you can customize it with markers or crayons (which could be fun if you're artsy), other than that, the binder is pretty basic. If I could give this binder 4 1/2 stars I would.The one flaw is that it is going to get soiled more easily than other binders, but that isn't enough of an issue to subtract an entire star.The cover seems to beg to be doodled on or otherwise adorned, although the Kraft paper brown is certainly attractive in its own right. This is a binder that has a lot of potential. I think this is a pretty decent binder. For them, I have found that a flexible binder in general will make it farther though the school year. If you're environmentally conscious, this is the binder for you!
