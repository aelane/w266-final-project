With my old printer I had to buy new cartridges when the old ones still had some of the colors left. I messed my other printer up by buying the cheap reloaded ink cartridges- big mistake- never do that again! Easy to install, and printer produces great products. My printer drinks it slowly, but when it goes dry, you can't get around needing another one. My printer also takes this 226 black ink. Oh, and be sure to turn your printer off completely if you won't be using it for a few days. Not meant for my printer although it popped up when I looked for my printers toner. With an earlier printer I had some issues with 3rd part ink (some ran out very quickly, one leaked, and I had lots of trouble with clogged print head).For some reason, the gray ink seeks to be used up faster than the other colors. (Even if the printer shows a 'red x' above the ink tank, I'll press 'ok' to get rid of the ink status message & continue printing. I loved my Canon printer but the ink purchases were making me poor! It's very easy to replace this in your printer. All printer manufactures make thier money off of ink cartridges vs. the printer. When this printer dies, I'll go back to HP or another brand, depending on cartridge costs. The printer requires 6 ink cartriges and this is the primary black for color printing. I use my printer both for normal text work and for photos.
