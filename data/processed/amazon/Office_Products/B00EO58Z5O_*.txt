* Must be connected by USB. Not a deal-breaker.Summary:* Admirable document scanner meant for the light user. * Scanner has difficultly with long documents, in excess of 16" long, such as long receipts. * Epson probably has better tracking to make sure pages line up evenly. * Neither works great on business cards, but I think Epson is a little better on that. * ScanSnap is the market leader but Epson is challenging it with this scanner and price point.In summary, Epson urgently has to upgrade its software to improve the interface and create documents faster. )* Turned on OCR so that the output PDF would be searchable. * Turned on skew correction in case any of my pages were cocked diagonally. * Speed - ultra fast* Sound - extremely quiet* Setup - I love the compact profile of the scanner, the fact that it folds down into a small unit that can be easily tucked onto a bookshelf in my office.
