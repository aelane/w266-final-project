This is a 1" binder, with a cover that folds out in front to put less stress on the binder when it's full. All in all a good basic binder. This binder is definitely superior to those we've tried before. The D-ring on the binder - nice to have because it accommodates more paper than a traditional 3-ring binder - opens and closes smoothly and easily. This binder is distinguished by the ease in which it opens and its generous five year warranty. The binder I received is more a dark lime color than either the anticipated olive or khaki. The binder is quite sturdy, with a D-ring style clasp rather than a half circle, which accommodates more paper. This is a heavy-duty binder and appears to be well made and durable.There is only one tab/trigger (located at the bottom) to open the metal rings. This Wilson Jones binder does seem a little sturdier than an average binder, especially the D Ring mechanism that smoothly opens and closes. First this binder has a better open-shut mechanism than other binders. This 1-Inch binder has some cool features that may be appealing if you are in need of a very good quality binder. This binder opens very easily with one finger and closes just as easy. I've never had a decent-quality binder fail there, but this one does look as though it might hold up better when they get heavy use.Is it worth the difference? The binder label does say it has a 5-year guarantee.I don't have much opinion on the color - it is sort of a medium grass green (I would not describe as army green as in the Amazon description).2 stars for the binder flaps quality and 4 stars for the D-ring --> overall rating of 3 stars I like that I can fill the binder to maximum capacity and not worry about the inner rings opening and freeing all my papers.This binder is 1" inch and can hold up to 275 sheets of paper. It's not hi-tech...Overall, very nice and quality binder. This is pretty much your standard binder, from what I can tell. That's not so good...  That being said, the binder overall isn't too bad, and I'd call it average quality. I'd say it's just an average binder, as good as any other. The actual binder bends easily. I am a binder fanatic. I went back and checked some of them to make sure.The binder works well. Great binder for laminated studies...the color is great too! When I lifted this binder out of the box, the first thing I noticed were all the bubbles underneath the plastic that covers the binder. The Wilson Jones Ultra Duty D-Ring Binder with Extra Durable Hinge (Army Green) is a decent binder for the money. It has a d-ring binder which opens and closes nicely and holds the paper well. I've hardly ever had a binder survive a whole school year, much less 5. If this binder is going to last through multiple school years, it would be nice to slide in a cover and then slide it back out and change it when it's used for another subject. This is a great binder. This is a very nice 1" 3 ring D binder. This is a plastic binder, so there is not great mystery to it. I got it to replace a binder that was much too large for my needs & about 30 years old (it was my grandmothers). This binder is a lovely olive color and has two plastic pouches on the inside of the back and front cover to put sheets of paper for separation from what is in the D-rings. I have been using this binder on a daily basis for about a month. It is the easiest binder hinge I have ever used. I love this binder. This binder fulfilled everything I could've asked from it and more.It's small but can hold a lot of paper. It looks like this binder and I will be in it together for the long haul. This Wilson binder's strong hinge may make it more suitable for your needs. I like how easy this binder opens and closes, but other than that it's a pretty run-of-the mill binder and not something I got super excited over.It wasn't as thick or strong as I thought it would be by the description given, but it seems like it would hold okay with light use over time. This binder I will use to try to organize lots of papers I have. I look forward to seeing how this binder holds up with all the in and out of backpacks and lockers. This binder works perfectly well for that purpose. I ended up having to label the binder with a sharpie. This binder has seemed pretty durable. I've been using the binder for over a month and I haven't had any issues with it yet. This is a good binder. The binder also has four inner pockets.I am pleased with this binder. That means the binder sits on the shelf most of the time except when I take it down to pull out a recipe. I was therefore extremely pleased with the Wilson Jones binder. You won't have to hold the binder down or assist that tab in fully opening the rings. I would suggest that the binder be made available in several different colors. Time will tell but I'd be surprised if these lasted any longer than any other binder out there.
