Overall, I've seen better regular/standard 1" binders that I would rather purchase, such as theAvery Economy Binder. I use many binders where I continue to add more documents, so need one that can stand having the rings opened and closed repeatedly. Having had some binders come out of alignment and end up useless or bending under the pressure of having heavy books placed on top of them - if you need a binder that will last more than just occasional use this is a good choice. These binders are durable and hold a lot of paper. I usually use Avery binders and though this is billed as &#34;heavy duty&#34; I honestly can't feel a difference between this binder and my &#34;regular&#34; old Avery binders. Some binders the rings are attached to the back, which some prefer, but this is what I would call &#8220;standard&#8221; and attached to the spine. This are nice binders, I need to have one for my job.These are basic white color, with the standard three ring paper holder.They also have plastic pockets on the inside that will hold a few papers.Nothing fancy, but these binders do the job IMO. These binders are durable, but I could not tell any major difference between this and the ones sold at Wal-Mart or some other convenience store. Many of my binders have rings that are very hard to open. What I like about it is the binders are not on the spine but offset and on the back panel. I really hate it when the binders are on the spine. I use these binders to store recipes and patterns that I get online, I especially like these for storing anything that you reference a lot as the &#34;extra durable hinge&#34; keeps the front cover from breaking off which I have had a problem with in the past. Durable and well designed I really like these binders! These binders are great for my children as they take a beating in their backpacks and I have to change them out ever 4 to 5 months. I personally didn't think they were any different than the binders I get that do not claim to be heavy duty. Thin binders seem best suited to something like individual customer or patient records, most of which (in the US at least) are in electronic form now. These 3 ring white binders are standard in the Healthcare field. I usually buy Wilson binders for my printed files.

These binders are billed as the manufacturer's "strongest ever."

Even the most generic of binders that I find at Staples (or even the Dollar Tree) is better quality.Because of the torn rear cover, no insert can be placed in this notebook and since I index the contents of my binders using inserts placed in the outer covering, this one is essentially useless (unless I want to patch it up with shipping tape--lovely).I'm a writer, I live in an ocean of office supplies and organizing tools like binders.

We have quite a few Wilson Jones binders in our house and are generally happy with them.
