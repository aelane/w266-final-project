I slid 2 cards into each sleeve, which can be done if you use extreme care and also don't plan on getting those cards back out to use them in a timely manner. I'll probably continue to use it  because my cards never make it back into my wallet-type organizer after I use them, and often get lost in my purse. My cards were easy to find and simple to use and put away. It holds 20 cards and fits easily in my purse. This &#34;organizher&#34; holds a LOT of cards if you can fit them in, but have you ever seen men who carry around a ward of cards by a rubber band? I found that I can even put 3 cards (gift cards, credit cards, not loyalty cards) into one slot, albeit it will get a little bit hard to pull out. It makes it much easier to use the cards the way they are supposed to be used.I recommend this organizer highly. I would not recommend this for cards you take out on a regular basis. I didn't try to pull any cards out because it was hard enough getting them in. I hate to carry all those cards for drug and grocery stores, so I keep the one or two I use the most on me and use my phone number for the rest. So I took them out...and then I find that the cards now slide out a little too easily.

I think loyalty cards are a nuisance but I use them because I want the perks.

It's even worse when you try to get TWO cards back to back, which I assume is the expected use of this organizer.The organizer comes with a plain white heavy-stock paper card in each sleeve.

Initially, I tried to put my cards in the sleeves with the cardstock in place but found it not only too difficult to get the cards in but also that it made the Organizher HUGEly thick and unweildy.
