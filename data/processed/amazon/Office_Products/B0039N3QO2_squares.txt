I used 4 of the squares and the mirror is very secure! Those didn't even hold.These squares "Scotch Reusable Tabs" were sure to be another entry on the list.But I was wrong, so very wrong. We tried these squares to hang up standard postcards on the walls in our kids' rooms. But to remove the squares from regular paper (88-92# weight) it is quite tough, and took some of the paper off with the square. I don't know how often I'll need to use these squares, so I'll just throw it into the drawer with all of the other things that I save for "just in case". Put them together and you get this.The 18 squares are pre-scored into 1"x1" pieces that you plick apart. These little squares are wonderful. These small squares are super sticky, yet you can remove and replace paper without tearing! The adhesive squares are not completely flat-- they have a little depth to them, which makes them hold well. I used four squares to attach a heavy calendar to the refigerator and it hold it there like glue. The squares came off cleanly without damaging any of the surfaces or leaving any residue behind. Plus, you have to save the tiny squares of paper that you peel off so that you can cover the other sticky side of the adhesive square.So what uses could I see for these squares? The squares are clear. There are 18 squares in each Scotch tab package. You cannot just carelessly pull the squares off, you must use care and remove them with the motion shown on the label.The only reason I gave these less than five stars is that I was initially disappointed in the slow-fall issue before following instructions. The squares can be a little tricky to peel, and as each square will then yield 2 little thin plastic sheets which will defy any attempts at disposal: static cling. These pre-cut squares of adhesive tape are perfect if you are an art or photography student. There's not much to say here: These are 1x1" squares of double-sided tape. These are squares with adhesive on each side.
