I looks like depending which arm you buy determines what smaller parts are put in the big box. I then mounted the VESA arm to the monitor and completed the assembly by mounting it to the arm.My monitor now &#8220;floats&#8221; in front of me and moves way easier than the original stand provided for. The arm allows the monitor to be adjusted up and down AND in and out with barely little effort.I would highly recommend this product. (2) The articulated arm of the Ergotron allows you to easily move your monitor up and/or to the side of the desk if you need your monitor out of the way. (3) The articulated arm allows you to position your monitor very precisely so your monitor can be comfortably viewed. The arm easily folds in on itself, making this ideal for all sizes of desks, from the small to large desks.It has a clamp mount and a grommet mount attachment included and is pretty straight forward to put together. The 3M Easy Adjust arm was exactly as described; easy to assemble, and easy to mount on my desk. The two arm attachments slide and then &#8220;snap&#8221; into place with an easy to put on (and remove) button that slides with a finger. For the arm balance (the tension in the spring extension arm) to increase tension you turn counterclockwise and to decrease you turn clockwise. The top arm of the mount, while metal, is covered from top to bottom in grey/silver plastic.

The arm easily supports my 24 inch monitor.

The arm only moves through 180 degrees safely when using the clamp fixture, but can swivel through 360 on the grommet mount.

It is very, very sturdy and will most likely last you a lifetime.The arm has many points of articulation, and they all function very smoothly.
