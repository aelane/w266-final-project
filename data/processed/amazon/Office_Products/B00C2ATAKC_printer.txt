Also, it should go without saying, the printer prints very well too.So if you're looking for something that can copy, scan, fax, and use laser printing technology in a home office, I would recommended this one for you. This printer will do pretty much any office printing task and it is easy to learn to operate. I like that the printer is quiet.The only improvement  could have wished for is a paper manual.Overall, I am very satisfied with this printer. Samsung Multifunction Xpress SL-M2875FW Wireless is a very well-made, reliable printer. This printer was very easy to install. I have tried out another Samsung printer before and was quite happy with it. What I also liked, was that it's a quite printer. I could see this printer being used in a small office or for those who run a small business from their home. I definitely recommend this printer to anyone who has a small business or who needs a printer for a small office. All in all a decent black and white printer, far better than the brutes that I've been using at school, though they're public, but still none of the lines I get on those prints at all.Just does it's job well.A month later there was a fix it issue and Samsung's warranty is to have a repair man visit one's house and it's quickly repaired.

It does not put the printer on each app's print menu.

This printer really does do it all, and does it all well.

To me this printer seems to do most of the things that a less expensive printer can do but at either a faster rate or otherwise better.
