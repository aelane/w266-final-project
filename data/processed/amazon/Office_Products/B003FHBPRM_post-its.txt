Maybe if you don't use many post-its that might be enough for you- but I use a lot. The fan-fold post-its are in a little envelope to pull out. I often need post-its when I'm away at meetings or at school with binders in hand. You put the post-its in, fold in the sides, then the top and bottom..remove adhesive. So great to have post-its right in my binder for when I need them. I can't say I would recommend it over traditional post-its unless your a super neat freak organizer and have some extra cash to spend. And the post-its really do pop up nicely. They're post-its, and do what you'd expect. These post-its are kinda neat but there usefulness is limited nowadays. The  zig-zag stacked post-its dispense well. I find it easier to peel off individual post-its when they are not in this dispenser.4. Perhaps you can use regular post-its from a big stack, but it's difficult to determine.
