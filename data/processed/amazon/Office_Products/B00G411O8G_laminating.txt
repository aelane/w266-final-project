Instead, I ended up wasting a whole laminating sheet and subsequently had to cut it down to size. It is very nice to have perfectly sized laminating pouches for our 4x6 photos for the infrequent times when we do laminate them.The size of this package is perfect, just 20 laminating pouches. The laminating pouches are 5 mil in thickness and easily go through the machine without cracking, tearing or bubbling up. These thermal laminating pouches work exactly the way I expect with my simple home laminator (in my case, a Fellowes.) I was relieved to find reasonably-priced laminating pouches, as the others I had looked at were so expensive. These are good laminating pouches and provide a great way to protect valuable reference information. These are good laminating pouches, and come in a cardboard sleeve so that they can be stored vertically on a shelf. These are among the better laminating pouches I've used. The laminating pouches work well with my laminator. If you're just getting started with laminating I would buy more pouches than you think you might need because you'll find more things to laminate than you thought!

I've worked with laminating film for several years and these work great.

I've used the do-it-yourself laminating pouches and the loose laminating sheets.

The do-it-yourself laminating supplies can get excellent results too, but I've also gotten wrinkles and lots of bubbles.
