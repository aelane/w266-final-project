I picked up my last office chair at a Staples Black Friday sale, 2011. Fortunately for me, Amazon Vine came through with the Lota, my first mesh office chair with ergonomic features. Unlike every other office chair I have ever owned, this model does not look like it will fail due to metal fatigue of the tilting base. This is an awesome office chair. Unlike some of the advanced office chairs, you don't have to read a manual to figure out how to use it.The best rating for this is 3.5 stars since, at this price point, the issue of lumbar support should have been addressed. I've tried several office chairs for my home office over the years, and have in general had mixed results. It has become the office chair of choice for me. I've always wanted a mesh-back office chair since the first time I tried one out at an IT office, years ago. It rolls less quickly over low office carpet, but it still doable. I have a few office chairs in my house. I usually buy whatever is cheap at the office store. It is suitable for any office, including the home office, where I have it. It's not a high-end office chair but it does the job at home.
