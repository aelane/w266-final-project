I have owned a Quartet board for over two years now and love it. This white board is going up low down in my home so my grandson can put and move magnetic toys on it. He's only one so he can't use pens yet but I see this board as something that will enable many years of fun. If you need a white board, this will do the trick, but don't expect miracles from the magnetic feature. I originally requested this board to replace another one I have, but it is about half the size, so I put it up in another area as an additional board. I keep my board in a room with small animals and use them for lists of supplies I need for my house pets. I really like that this board (unlike my older one) is magnetic. I love the board, I love the magnets. Also the board is magnetic and comes with 2 cute magnets, and the markre is also magnetic and will stick to the board. The Quartet Magnetic Whiteboard is an average magnetic erasable board and not more. Putting it on the board on the inner edge of that plastic frame helps the board sit more flush to the wall.Got a level, placed it where I wanted it, and pressed. This board has been the perfect solution. Still, it's a great board for every day use. The board however writes and wipes well enough. This is a nice, large board. I prefer to be able to take it up and down to write and display, so I like it when the board has picture hanger type corners you can attach to a pin or hook. The board wipes cleanly enough that there is no need for a wet spray to erase.My only minor complaint about the board itself is that it has no tray at the bottom to hold accessories. I would not hesitate to recommend if you need a board this size. The board is well-sized for the door without looking overly large or small; and the white color plastic trim blends into the standard white door paint.I primarily use post-it notes with the magnetic pins so that I can walk out with a chore/task instead of trying to remember it or  re-jot it. The board along with the magnetic pins works well for this purpose. The board doesn't come with any erasers; but a paper towel would do a good job.I wish it had a small tray at the bottom for keeping things like pen, eraser, magnets, etc.It is a good looking and reasonably well built whiteboard that can be improved. I really didn't want to hang the board up with the double sided adhesive pads.What I did was put one of the double sided adhesive pads on each corner, you can easily see where they go, then I took a flat flexible magnet I got at some event with a bank ad on the front and cut 4 pieces a bit bigger than the size of each adhesive pad.
