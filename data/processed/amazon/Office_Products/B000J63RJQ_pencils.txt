So these pencils appealed immediately when I found them, offering a much more mess-free way to allow my kids to indulge in their love for painting.The set offers a nice array of colors, and they work beautifully as colored pencils. I think Derwent should just call them colored pencils and leave it at that. I love colored pencils and these are above average in terms of color vibrancy and sturdiness, however, what I was most intrigued about in their advertising was what I felt like they lacked! These pencils are quite unique. These pencils give you the ability to use as a normal colored pencil, and by adding just a bit of water can transform your work into something different. These pencils are durable and perfect for any level of artist. These pencils come in 24 various colors. The pencils are hexagonally shaped and easy to hold onto while using them. But overall, they are quality colored pencils and I recommend them if you have a child who loves to color and/or paint or you yourself loves to do so. These pencils are easy to use and hold on to. I don't like these pencils. I have some pencils that are round. These are amazing colored pencils!
