What took the most time was removing all of the tape protecting the parts while it shipped. Total time from opening the box to printing the first page was about 15 minutes. The first time I got this thing set up, my computer instantly detected and it worked great. If I take the time to scan them into Photoshop or PSP first, some of them even come out better than the originals. If it did shut down it took a long time. I hope that it lasts a long time. So I don't think I'll be wasting much time and ink on 'best photo' when regular is fantastic!I did a few other speed & quality comparisons and whenever photos were involved the Artisan won. For the first time, I'm not embarrassed to have an All-In-One sitting on my desk!Installation was my next big concern. At the time I purchased an Epson Artisan 700 and if you read my review of it you'll see how much I was impressed by it as it was leaps and bounds above the 700. You'd have a hard time finding something better in this category. I've only owned one really bad one in all that time.

I prefer to simply load and go, and not spend time fussing with the printer tray.The machine calibrated itself, and was read to work nearly instantly.

It jammed every single time I tried to print a page.
