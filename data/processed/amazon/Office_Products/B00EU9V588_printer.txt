After this printer, they might strip me of my rank. The Epson Expression Premium XP-610 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner and Copier is a solid and well built printer that has done everything I have asked of it. Although the printer will handle up to 11&#34; widths, it really isn't economical to make ink-jet prints that big on a regular basis. The printer does come with ink cartridges. Yet, all-in-all, a nice printer, good price, quiet, easy setup....I like it. The printer recognized my network immediately, and I'm able to print from a desktop Mac, laptop Mac, and iPod Touch with no problem. We got this printer a couple of months ago. Just DON'T buy this printer. I just received the printer today. This printer couldn't locate my home Wi-Fi for a wireless set up. I finally figured out that on this printer your paper goes to the extreme right of the glass. All previous printer setups went much quicker & that includes an Epson 645 Workforce. I downloaded the printer app for my phone and was able to print a photo. This is a fairly decent printer. If you need a printer for documents, then go for a cheaper laser printer or a multi-function printer that's designed to print a LOT of pages in short amounts of time.The reason I'm not recommending this printer for anything but all-around use is because the ink runs out too fast, and it's not a particularly fast printer. Otherwise, buy a printer designed for a specific function- you won't have to monkey around with calibration, print settings every time you switch the paper size, paper type, etc. I picked this printer up when our old dinosaur HP bit the dust. This printer was, as you would expect, incredibly easy to set up right out of the box. I have another Epson Photo printer, so Epson was the obvious choice. I have had this printer for 3 weeks now and printed, scanned or copied over 500 pages, envelopes and photos. The printer is very quiet compared to my other printers (Brother and HP), expecially when "Quiet" mode is used but even without "Quiet" mode. So if it is such a great printer why only 4 stars instead of 5? First, since I have only had the printer 3 weeks I cannot yet say how durable this printer will be in the long term - say 3 to 5 years. Third, while this printer does not appear to be an ink eating monster like my HP printer was, I noticed while looking at the Epson web site that replacement factory ink cartridges are pretty expensive. This printer takes the 273 or 273XL cartridges. Although I got this printer from Vine, I like the fact that you can get high quality printing at a reasonable price. I haven't used the printer enough yet to see if Epson has overcome the biggest complaint I had about my last Epson: it gobbled ink. I think this printer surpasses 2 of those printers, but not the other 3. The printer assumes you're using premium paper. Why can't the printer have an output slot? This printer requires some trial and error. I was particularly interested in this printer in order to have a printer accessible to my iPad via airprint. Moreover, while Epson has bought into the new normal of the printer deciding when it is out of ink, unlike HP the printer was really out, so I can't complain. If you are looking for a printer for under $100 for your desk, I don't see anybody offering a unit that can beat this Epson. It&#8217;s a surprisingly compact printer and would be a good choice for someone short on space.The set-up was no more difficult than any other printer I&#8217;ve had. If I was needing a LASER printer I would check out the Brother printers for both color and monochrome. The printer ha a very small footprint, so it fits just about anywhere. You can also setup the printer to print via Google Cloud Print. After placing the printer on my home network, I was immediately able to print to it from all of my iOS and Android phones and tablets.The driver installation is pretty simple. The printer will not print unless the paper output tray is fully extended. If this isn't the best $100 printer on the market, I'd like to see the one that is.PROs------------------------+ The easiest-to-use printer I've ever used+ Two paper trays, one for photo paper, one for plain paper, with auto-select+ Works with iPhone/iPad+ High quality prints+ Double-sided printingCONs------------------------- Obnoxious adware built into the driversSETUP------------------------There were two parts to setting up this printer. I disconnected the printer cable from my laptop but was still able to print. !Once the printer was on my wireless network, it automatically showed up as a printer on my iPhone; I didn't have to do any other setup and I was able to print both pictures and emails right off my phone. The printer is neither quiet nor loud. I am very pleased with this printer. The first Epson printer I purchased was the WF-3520, and I love it, so I was very excited to try the XP-610 for photo printing. I would definitely recommend this printer ever for the fussiest photog. It isn't necessary to have a printer cable to set up the printer and I was able to set up the printer to our home wifi without a hitch. Like the XP-800, and any other Epson printer for that matter, you will plug through ink very quickly if you like to print out a lot. If you're looking for a more substantial printer, you may want to take a look at the XP-810, but for casual/student users, this printer will certainly take care of all your printing needs. This is my 5th printer currently in my home. The printer industry, born of the principal "give away the razor and get rich selling blades", has as though one entity shied away from making truly comparable cost and cartridge volume disclosures, and the whole industry gets a negative star rating from me, for that.- without an ADF, it's not truly an all-in-one, capable of scanning multiple pages in an efficient manner. This printer was ridiculously easy to install onto our wireless network. Great little printer - very easy to set up -nice footprint - loved the wireless function - good quality printing. However, you might want to buy this printer only if your purpose is to have great photo printouts, along with other minor daily printing needs. I can move the printer anywhere I like to print, since it's also very light, without having to worry about the network wire.The paper tray is very thin and it holds only about 100 sheets of paper; not enough for frequent printing in an office, but more than enough for home use.It has a secondary tray that holds about 20 sheets of premium photo paper. I am pleased as can be with this printer, which I'm using with my Mac Air (and also MacBook Pro).I am a fan of Epson printers, and was happy to have the opportunity to review this model for Amazon. Still, for an all-on-one printer, I'm very happy. I have had this printer for about a month now. And I had printed so very little since installing the printer!! Now I won't know until I have the printer back up, whether I have successfully cancelled the no-longer-needed print order. Very nice printer, easy to install and love all the features. Frankly, this little printer compares well, even though it does not have the document feeder with double sided scan/copy/fax.This little printer comes in handy for a quick photo or for everyday printing.Epson has perfected its ink delivery system so that I can turn off the automatic cleaning for months at a time, saving precious ink (see ending discussion) and even after not printing for weeks the ink delivery works great.A great feature that I use that is not well published is the built in easy creation of lined paper, graph paper, and even personalized note paper. This printer is also much more compact than my previous printer and can do everything and more than the old one. However, as a second printer, or perhaps you already have a fax machine, the machine could still work for you nicely.The quality of text printing for business documents is high quality. Indeed, this printer makes business document printing its priority with its sharp, crisp text. though older printer models ink have slightly better availability. It did not fit in my usual printer location because the tray would hit my monitor when it was fully extended. Finding the printer is also very easy via the printer-finder software on the included CD.The only thing I don't like is that the ink cartridges are not self-refillable. This is perhaps the most basic printer in the Epson Expression lineup and it is much more limited than its more expensive big brothers, but it was exactly what I was looking for in a printer. Just a good, solid and (seemingly) reliable printer. This is my third epson printer in 3 years.My first two printers, an Epson WP-4530, and this printers predecessor, the XP-600, both died exactly the same way. If you do decide to buy this printer, be aware it will work well for a year and then you're cooked. Great printer! All in all the printer is worth the money, and you won't be tossing it in the garbage when it is time for ink! I went through troubleshooting with Epson and it was determined that the printer was broken. I connected the printer when prompted I was up and running in about 15 minutes (the PC it's connected to is fairly old). I got the printer to print a good quality photo and to do duplexing. It seems like the printer has a lot of features but it remains to be seen if it will hold up. I'm satisfied with it as a secondary printer for my crafts room it's but too much of an ink drinker to be my primary printer.

The XP-610 is a decent printer but the reason I gave it one star is because of the Epson software.

@highlight

I tried using this printer with the direct USB connection and the Epson software still tried to go out to internet surreptitiously.

That means the printer (software) has access to your computer and the internet.Printer features and quality are good but it appears to have some glitches.
