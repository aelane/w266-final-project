The ink comes out evenly, writes very dark and dries instantly.Each pen has a small silicon/plastic ball on the tip so be sure to remove it before trying to write with the pen. The ink doesn't smudge, it writes fast, but I didn't find anything particularly special about this pen. The ink flows out smoothly without any problems and does not normally smear (it will smear a tiny bit if you purposely try to smear it right after writing, but it does not smear otherwise).I also love the look of this pen. The ink flows smoother and more evenly than the Pilot pens I have been using. The ink gel flows out smoothly and evenly without having to apply a lot of pressure. My favorite pen ever is the BIC Cristal, blue ink, but even those have recently let me down lately, with an even cheaper plastic than ever. The ink flows very cleanly and smooth. No messy ink blots or smudges. The ink blobs a little at the beginning and end of each stroke but it also dries relatively quickly so I don't get as much smearing as I do with 1.0mm pens.The pen refill reservoir is wide so there should be a good amount of ink to last a while.The feel of the pen is smooth with just a little scratch that's noticeable but not irritating to me -- certainly not like that of a thinner tip where each fiber of the paper can be felt like nails running across a chalkboard.The only thing that I'm not thrilled with is the body of the pen. Without having to first get the ink flowing by making all those squiggly scratchy marks down on the corner of the paper first.I'm holding onto these things and skipping the cheapies from school supply aisles. No 'blobbing' of the ink. Gel ink glides on the paper and leave elegan, think line that does not cut deep into paper or spills. These black ink pens work quite well and are pleasant to write with. The ink has proven to be amazingly waterproof, something unusual for most gel type pens.

The ink doesn't blob (which is the only problem you find with the average gel pen), and the construction is absolutely first-rate.

I can only hope the ink lasts a while and doesn't dry up too quickly.

Besides non-smearing ink, Zebra pens are way less bulky.
