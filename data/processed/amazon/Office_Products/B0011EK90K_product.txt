Excellent product, effective;  Scotch is a well-known maker of office products for years.....Rizzo Nice product, for organizing, displaying, and school projects. This is an excellent product for displaying photos, data sheets, brochures & etc. This product was easy to use and worked fine. Another very useful product from 3M! I am pleased to say that this product sticks well, is very clear, and is easy to use and maintain. This product is generally superior to what we have used before.I would have given this product 4.5 stars if that was an option but decided that a 4-star rating wouldn't be fair as my use of these is somewhat unique. I have to say that Scotch made a good product with this "Display Pocket". Other than that it is a good product and I would recommend it to others needing this sort of thing to display items on a wall.Thanks for reading my little review. This is a perfectly serviceable product. Not a terrible product, but I'm not super impressed. This is a really cool product that I am amazed no one has come with it years ago. I don't think I would actually buy this product but it's well made and functions well for anyone who has a need for one. It is a nice product, and you can velcro it directly to your cubicle. I am now using this product for a print I especially want to preserve and have up on my wall. This product comes with one display pocket. This product combines four command strips and a plastic sleeve. So while I like this product, you are paying a premium to have 3M package it all together. This is a great simple product which you can use for a number of purposes. The product is very good quality, clear, and sturdy. This product is a clever way to display your photo or certificates without the need to purchase expensive frames and the need to put a nail through the wall to hang it. This product is easy to use,neat and professional.I use it to mount and organize my digital art portfolio.it helps me organize my visual library. I was really hoping for a good product out of this, and I would have to say I am disappointed. I would not recommend this product because of the difficulty putting a document into the sleeve and it looks not so great anyplace but a kids room.
