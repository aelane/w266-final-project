A nice size to use for an attractive design with an illustration and your name. They are the perfect size to print the new scanning codes for cellphones! They are the perfect size for my book cover - print them out and then adhere them to magnetic sheets. I really liked the generous size of these labels and again, the options for use are endless. If the size works for you, great. At first I thought "I can't use these due to the size" but I tend to be creative and saw many possibilities. The 2 by 2 inch size is great because it's big enough to actually write something legible. I've used the smaller size of these labels before, but this one is a little roommier.These have a matte finish and print easily on an inkjet or laser printer. These are a neat size and hold both toner and inkjet printer ink great. I like the size of these labels. I see that there is a slightly smaller size, but I'm very happy with this particular size and format.Note that the labels are square, with square not rounded corners.

This size is so versatile too from address labels to product descriptions on a myriad of items.
