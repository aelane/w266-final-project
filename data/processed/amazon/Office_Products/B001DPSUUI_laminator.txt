I've got the laminator from this company and they work very well together. I think with most any thermal laminator, you have to be careful to try and feed it evenly and straight into the machine, as well as have some support for it as it comes out to minimize warping. Using the Scotch laminator, I haven't had any issues with either brand or mil of pouches. Using the Fellowes laminator, I had waving on the finished product using both mils, regardless of whether it was standard copy paper or card stock.I recently made 2 signs, one using this Fellowes 5mil pouch and one using the Scotch brand, using the Scotch laminator and both look flawless with no excessive waves. I bought an inexpensive Scotch laminator a year agoScotch Thermal Laminator 2 Roller System (TL901)and started laminating everything--recipes, some old letters and even contracts that I wanted to protect. If your heated laminator can process a 5 mil pouch, these are great! I only recently bought a laminator and I can't believe the things I find to laminate after never having an urge to do it before. I got these for my Scotch laminator, since the description stated that they could be used with any laminator. They worked perfectly in the Scotch laminator, and I like the 5-mil thickness, which is more durable and a bit weightier than the usual 3-mil thickness that I've been using for most things. They ran right through my Fellows Cosmic 95 laminator without any problems. In my laminator, at least, no carrier is needed with these - because they're sealed at one end, they can just be fed through with that end first and they won't jam.I know that 5ml is the weight, so all 5ml pouches should be approximately the same as far as that goes, but I felt like these were actually just a little bit heavier/stiffer than my other 5ml pouches. I was able to use these on my very inexpensive Purple Cow laminator.
