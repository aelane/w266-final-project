The "Stanley Bostitch EPS14HC Super Pro Glow Commercial Pencil Sharpener" is an impressive pencil sharpener. If Darth Vader had a pencil sharpener, this would be it. Seriously, this is a great pencil sharpener, I can't really imagine how anyone could improve on the ideas and design of this unit. This is by far the best pencil sharpener I've ever had.I would say this is for a school, a commercial artists shop, etc. This pencil sharpener has a good heft, which indicates good quality. This pencil sharpener takes only seconds to sharpen a pencil and it glows and automatically shuts off when the pencil is sharp. It sharpens better than any other pencil sharpener I've tried and it doesn't break the leads like many regular pencil sharpener would.It is very easy to empty the shavings  and put back together. Up to now I have been using an inexpensive $12 electric pencil sharpener purchased at a local department store to sharpen pencils at home. I tried turning the pencil while sharpening, but it did not seem to make any difference. This really should not be necessary for such an expensive pencil sharpener. This pencil sharpener is in a class by its self.
