This printer is absolutely amazing for the price. Ugh.Anyway, I think the printer itself is a wonderful deal for the consumer, and perfect for someone who just wants to print low volume items, but, the ink is a wonderful deal FOR THE PRODUCER OF THE INK.My last printer, a multifunction HP, purchased four years ago cost almost 10 times as much as this printer -and yes, it is a lot higher quality, quicker, and wireless, but if my printer broke today I would probably buy something a lot cheaper with the same functions as this printer.PROS:COST OF THE PRINTER-this is the cheapest-non-piece-of-junk-multifunction-printer that I've ever seen. With this printer you MUST have a computer to scan: you cannot just scan an image directly to a memory card without a computer. The printer is like your Mach 3 Turbo razor, and the ink cartridges are the refillable blades. If, however, you just need a printer for one computer in one room, or just want it because it can scan or make copies, then this is the one for you.If you only need to use this printer for leisure (and not work or school) then the cost of the printer and the functions of this printer can't be beat. Having just lost my printer in a tragic, ink-deprivation accident, I was very happy to get a new one. This printer makes things easy and the quality is fantastic. They did strip some of the more corporate printer frills like network interfaces and wireless, but those appear in their more expensive models. This is my 4th printer, not the 4th one I've owned, but the 4th one I own now. This is an all in one printer, copy, fax, scanner. Since this is going to be a second printer, I was more concerned with the networking aspects of it.
