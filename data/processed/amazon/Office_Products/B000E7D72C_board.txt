I use a white board (dry erase board) extensively with my work duties, so am in constant need of dry erase markers. But now I find my board diagrams are much more complicated. My particular while board is older and I see residue left behind by all dry erase pens. These wipe off the white board easy peasy too! These have to be my favorite white board markers that I have tried thus far. I have a large white board in my office that I use to plot out story ideas and keep task lists. We left writing on our very inexpensive white board overnight and it cleaned off without a problem. But cleaning the board well solved the problem (in other words, if you often use the same brand, switching can cause problems until the board is cleaned).Great pack with nice bright colors. These would be ideal if you are writing on a larger board and want your writing to be seen from a little further away. If you want a cleaner board without having to use a cleaner on it, don['t get these markers. I really like these white board markers.Unlike others, these are bold in color and really stand out when used on a white board.

I decided why not purchase a board to leave notes on at home.

When I was looking for my white board markers I found a set of these from last year and they were still nice and ready to go.They work very well and erase cleanly except for the red.

When used on a board the ink cleans off well not leaving any marks or streaks behind.
