Personally, if I'm going to attach a label I want it to be more permanent, and if I just want to flag something quickly a regular Post-It will do. Once the label is in place, simply tear away on the perforated line and the complete label is adhered to the box.They are also great for posting on the door to the garage so you don't forget whatever it is you need to take with you when you head for your car! Sometimes, I want to temporarily put a label on something... such as a book or dvd I'm going to loan to someone. I want to be sure I'll get it back and when I do, I can remove the label with no trace of it ever having been on the item. Likewise, I may also want to stick a label to my purse with an address I need so I can enter it into my GPS in the car. Having the addressed label stuck on my purse ensures I won't forget it nor do I have to search the contents of my purse to find it.The labels also stick to the dash of my car and almost nothing does that. So you can make the label semi permanent by removing the tab. Start peeling this label from the side where there's dotted line, stick it to a surface/material, and tear along the dotted line to remove the part that doesn't stick to the surface.The entire label sticks well to all surfaces I've tried so far: paper, book cover, plastic bottles, drawer, packing boxes, plastic sheets. The label can be removed without leaving sticky residue on the surface, and can be reapplied to another surface. If you need to stick a non-permanent label on an item, these do the trick better than many labels. Just write on your label, stick it on your item, and tear off the tab. You can also buy these in a 100 label pack (four x 25-sheet pads) for a little better price:Post-it Super Sticky Removable Label Pads, 1.8 x 2.8 Inches, Pink/Green, 100 Labels per pack (4 Pads) (2900-PG) I wrote my label, peeled it off and stuck it on the cardboard box. I just put the label on the wrong box! I needed a label for a ziploc of clothes for my kid's preschool, DONE!I needed a label for a book that I was lending a friend, DONE!I needed to label a storage box to store at the top of the closet, DONE!These are just small enough to stick here and there, they are big enough to be seen from a closet shelf. When you're done with the label, it removes cleanly without leaving any discernable residue.All in all, another useful application of Post-its from 3M. They are fine for sticking a quick label on something, but don't expect them to last. And because the adhesive fully backs the label, you aren't dealing with post-it "tags" that lift from the tubs.So my bottom line is taht they do EXACTLY what they say they will do! This allows you to apply the label flat. With the label flat on the surface, it can't be gently rubbed, knocked, or shuffled off. This label is not glued on, like say on a shipping label, but it simply attaches more securely than a traditional Post It.It's a great idea. The label pads come in fun bright colors that are easy-to-spot. If I want a label, I'd rather go buy permanent labels.
