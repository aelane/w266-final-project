It's a big enough machine that even in a small office it ought to be on the side. This has been an absolutely perfect machine and I really recommend it highly. Yes, this is not a small machine, so if you've purchased it for home use, make sure to have a large desk space for it. Some of the PROS about the machine are that the parts disassemble quickly and without trouble so that it is easy to clear the occasional jam, it updates its own firmware which is hassle-free, it is very proactive in letting you know about ink supply being low (ink cost is reasonable -- it links to a page where you can buy it online if you so choose), the printing quality is very impressive particularly if you mainly print black & white, and it's an aesthetically pleasing device. This is a heavy-duty machine that takes expensive cartridges, but at least they will not have to be changed frequently. Anyone getting this machine should not expect to plug it in and go. It's not the most silent machine when it's running, but it's being used in a work environment so it's not anything that's distracting or annoying.The wireless setup was almost flawless. Accordingly, this machine cannot be hidden on a desk.

Knowing it was an all-in-one machine, I expected it to be much larger than the average home/office printer, but still, this was larger than I expected.

Furthermore, the machine is easy to use and does not require one to be tech savy to set it up.
