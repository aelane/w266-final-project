Pros - flexible tips, write on many surfaces, permanent;Cons - tips not as flexible and fine-pointed as artist-quality brush markers, colors don't quite match marker tops, no case.This is a decent starter set of brush markers for decorating or for experimenting with. Also, since the tips are not as flexible as the Tombow tips, it is harder to get as subtle thick and thin calligraphic effects. I thought these brush tips would be a great addition to my "Sharpie Habit".I was right! The tips on these brush tip Sharpies are really soft - it is a lot like painting with a paint brush. These tips are very versatile and I am able to get some pencil thin lines with them. The tips are pointed, so they work very well for fine line drawing if treated lightly. I love the new tips for drawing. The tips are great for fine or thick lines.

I have seen "brush" tips on pens, and this is not one.

The tips are made for art work and do a great job.

And I think that the tips could get squished of flattened fairly easily.These were a lot of fun to play with and would be fun for art projects, making labels, etc.
