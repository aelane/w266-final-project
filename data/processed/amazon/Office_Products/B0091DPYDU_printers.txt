Even though laser printers are supposed to be the "bee's knees", I had no qualms going back to the "dark ages" of this all-in-one ink-jet. Ever have one of those printers that you hated so much you found excuses NOT to use it? I have owned and used printers from the very low-end to the highest-end units and I think this one (and a few others in this series) have finally gotten to the point that the value-per-dollar is definitely worth it. I have come to rely on Epson printers throughout my personal and professional like. Unlike some of Epson's first all-in-one printers, this is a solid unit with the bugs worked out. I steered away from Epson printers years ago when I began to doubt their quality. (Same as the Epson Workforce 545, 645, and 845 printers! printers in the past - I've used hundreds if not thousands of different printers and copiers in offices all over the US. Out of all the printers I've owned this one is by far the fastest. I will compare these printers to help guide those who are choosing among these or similar models. So I'd like to determine the best two printers for my needs.So, what's in this box?WF-3540 4-in-One WiFi Print/ Copy/Scan/Fax, with 2-sided options connects wired or wireless and 3.5 inch touchscreen with gesture navigation.1 each High-Capacity ink cartridge for Black, Cyan, Magenta and YellowInstruction ManualCD Rom driver and extra softwareSample paper (2 sheets, hardly worthy of mentioning and mine were crushed)Telephone cord, Power cable,USB cable NOT included.Support Videos are available on manufacturers website.The WF-3540 has 2 front 250-sheet paper trays, a 30-page document feeder and a rear feeder for envelopes, labels, card stock and media print. These aren't printers to use for photographic reproductions, but they'll do in a pinch, and will certainly be sufficient for business presentations and small runs of flyers.Since your decision at this price point may be between the 3540 and 4530, be aware that the 4530 is going to be slightly faster in terms of pages printed per minute. Epson printers contain a permanent print head that needs to be charged with all colors to work. Out of two separate Epson WF-3540 printers and several computers (Win 7 Pro, 64-bit, SP1), not a single computer was able to print, fax, or scan wirelessly. The Workforce printers excel at what they are, a versatile inkjet used for everything from business documents to school projects and photos. I love Epson printers. I've had three Workforce printers in recent years: a 610, 630 and now 3540. That was until I tried three HP printers between 2006-2011 and had all three stopped working within a year. Both printers are fast, hold 500 sheets of paper, and produce fine copies as well as printed sheets, but this one is perfect, even using a Mac. I own two of these now, and I've never found myself hating them like other printers. I've had HP printers over the past decade or so and finally decided to switch over to an Epson. My previous printers were always a pain in the neck with only allowing a thin stack in them.
