I don't have to worry about it getting dropped and broken like I would a heavier board. The board can easily be hung on a wall or attached to the front of a refrigerator. The board is solid and sturdy.The board has attachment pieces to hang on the wall, otherwise it is just a one-sided board.I like it in my kitchen for little notes. It doesn't seem to be cheap press-board, but who knows.Finally, the board has a nice heft to it, which *seems* to indicate it is made of higher-quality materials. I definitely prefer this board to, for example,Chalkboard 7"X10" - Gray, which is much more lightweight (and cheaper). It's particle board with a laminate wood finish.2. It's also lightweight.The board cleans well after writing on it. The entire board, including the frame is 8.5x11, so the writing surface is actually smaller than that. Anyway, I have been using a white board for years. The Quartet Chalkboard is a pressed board unit that has chalkboard paint. It allows me to take the board down and hang it up easily. The board has an indentation on the top for a piece of chalk which works nicely. I'm not using the board as a daily writing instrument, so I'm not sure how well it will hold up to daily use. It's particle board with chalkboard paint. This chalk board with it's wood frame is attractive enough to put almost anywhere in your house. The board comes with both double-sided adhesive tape and magnets. I played with this board by writing and cleaning it constantly and it held up well. The entire board itself might be 8.5" X 11", but the actual writing surface is only 6" X 8.5". This board reminds me of the large slate blackboards that we used to have in school and at my office. The board is a square which measures 14 x 14 Inches with a wood finish frame. The board is solid and sturdy, and the chalk surface is easy to clean. The board came with a set of hinges for mounting the board to a wall, but I have always used a mini easel on a tabletop. Oh, and if you do decide buy this board, be sure to buy some chalk too--this one doesn't come with any in the package. Nice board... solidly constructed.

This looks much more sophisticated than a traditional white board.

The board comes with mounting screws and instructions for how to mount it on a wall, but we have not bothered with this.

The board is small and convenient enough that it can be easily rested against almost any vertical surface.
