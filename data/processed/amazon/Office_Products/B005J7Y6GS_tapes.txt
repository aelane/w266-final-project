The tapes are fairly simple to switch between as they are cartridges that snap into place. Refill tapes are $$$$. The tapes are pricey - $17.50 a roll but since the tape refills are a business expense, it is a justifiable expense for me. The tapes can be used outdoors as well. I let them use it after showing them how to replace the tapes and it still works perfectly. You can use 1/2 or 3/4 inch tapes in a variety of colors or clear.3. The tapes cut cleanly and are printed with minimal blank space before and after the print which both serve to make this tape efficient. It handles 1/4"  3/8"  1/2"  and 3/4" tapes. Yes - the label tapes can be hard to find, and they can be expensive. Tactilely, the Brother tapes feels stiffer and stronger to me, but not by much. Some Epson tapes can be ironed on, but I do not know if Brother has entered this realm.Another area where the Brother excels is in print speed. The Brother tapes are NOT cheap. The 12mm tapes are 26 feet long and currently cost ~$12-14, or roughly 50/ft, and it wastes about an inch at each end unless the settings are adjusted to trim that back on one end to save about 3/4".
