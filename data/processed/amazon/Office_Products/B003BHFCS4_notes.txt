These are much stickier than standard post-it notes, but not so sticky they are too hard to remove. It's perfect for making temporary notes, labels, or bundling papers, etc. The notes stick well and they come off easily. Regular sticky notes don't stick in the freezer. Post-Its, which allow me to place notes on files and paperwork without making the notes permanent, are extremely helpful. Instead of using PostIt notes, which only have adhesive at the top, you can select an appropriate length just like a roll of tape. There are now Post-it notes in different sizes, colors, stickyness, etcetera. I have also used cut up (colored) post-it notes to tape on to my folder tabs.

I have found that the notes, with their one little strip of sticky and the rest a-flappin' in the breeze, are entirely too temporary and as some projects are abandoned or handed to someone else, the little notes were unreliable and a good deal of time is always spent by the person picking up the project trying to figure out what the person who started the project was thinking...  Ok, this isn't a frequent scenario, but it does happen.

It drives me bananas to find abandoned notes on the floor when I know they really belong somewhere...  We are an ADD/ADHD family, so getting and staying organized is a major necessity but also a huge challenge...

It's ideal for notes in books.
