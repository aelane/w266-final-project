These mechanical pencils have been so fun for my family and I.  I throw a couple in my bag and don't have to worry about the led breaking while we're out.Now don't expect your standard skinny, little mechanical pencil. I think these pencils are awesome, and the only reason I gave it 4 instead of five stars is because I can't find eraser refills. I typically use pencils with a .7mm or .5mm lead. These pencils fit my hand well and wrote just as well as a standard #2/HB pencil would write. The pencils write the right way (the lead is perfect).Highly recommended if you or your child have a need for mechanical pencils. I ordered these pencils because I thought they'd be great for my son who is learning to write. So while the pencils are really great in concept, I can't say that they're worth the money with only one small piece of lead included. Unfortunately, these Papermate pencils are no exception. While the pencils are mechanically sound and effective, I was led to believe the lead was colored and was disappointed to realize all the pencils were black lead. These pencils are great. They are shaped like real pencils, with a triangular (rather than hexagonal) surface around the pencil, and a large real pencil style eraser on the end. these mechanical pencils worked like they say they would. These are pretty neat pencils, perfect for younger children because of the thickness of the barrel. These pencils are neat because they are a cross between the regular pencil and the mechanical.The body of the pencil is triangular-shaped, which makes for a good grip. Regular mechanical pencils are rarely marked what number lead they have, so I give them a good ol' pencil just to be safe. I would recommend these pencils for kids and adults alike! I have pencils stashed all over the house but in particular in area I do my reading and writing. I actually found these pencils awkward to hold at first. There are better refillable pencils out there, though if you do need a larger grip pencil with a larger lead this will work just fine so long as you use an external eraser or only need to erase larger areas. I've never used mechanical pencils before. I don't tend to use pencils as much as in the past. What can you say about economical mechanical pencils. I have been searching for break-resistant mechanical pencils for my kids. I also love that they look like regular pencils and are refillable as well. The pencils seem durable so far. Still, good pencils for school kids who won't spend time sharpening pencils constantly in a classroom setting. Using these is so much easier than constantly sharpening broken pencils. She says that the thin mechanical pencils always make her fingers hurt, but the fatter pencil gives her more to hold on to.She really loves how strong the lead is. These mechanical pencils look more like markers or pens than mechanical pencils, and the array of colors make them more fun to own than the traditional boring mechanical pencils.Pros:1. I use mechanical pencils a lot because I'm a puzzle nut -- especially Sudoku. Along came these triangular shaped refillable pencils with 1.3 mm size #2 lead so I simply had to try them.The size of the barrel is comfortable in my hand. I have decided that I'm going to buy more of these pencils though. I think these pencils would solve a whole lot of the problems her young students have with their pencils during the test taking time. I found that these pencils were most adequate for what I wanted. I have bought/used mechanical pencils for more than 25 years now. These pencils write the way a regular wooden pencil writes! You must use these pencils for a while before you make up your mind. Among the varied mechanical pencils I buy, I often purchaseZebra Cadoozles Mechanical Pencil, 0.7mm, Assorted, 10 Pack (51211). I like the Paper Mate Mates mechanical pencils. These are the best mechanical pencils ever. These pencils are fat and a little uncomfortable...but I like that they have a good long eraser and the lead does not break easily like most mechanical pencils. Perhaps, it was because I was so used to the smaller 0.5mm pencils in school, but these ones obviously have thicker "lead" (Graphite) at 1.3mm. We homeschool and were lucky enough to test these pencils out. Until then, I'd steer clear unless you want to purchase new pencils every time the eraser runs out. The pencils also have a nice weight and heft to them--slightly thicker than a typical #2 pencil. The pencils are also slightly triangular for easy holding. Good pencils. Not sure what it is about mechanical pencils these days, but tween boys seem to be fixated on them. I know these pencils are supposed to be disposable, but I would rather keep refilling the disposable pencils than toss them out and buy more.So that's me. I like the pencils. I rarely use pencils for writing. These pencils follow the design where you make a writing implement triangular so it fits in the crook of your fingers well, and it has good length. These pencils come in an array of pleasing colors and a shape that is easy to hold. In trying out these pencils, I found that due to the larger barrel size, it was harder to hold than most pencils. I seldom use wooden pencils, as I hate having to sharpen them every time they dull. Mechanical pencils that never need sharpening with lead thick enough that you can apply pressure, without fearing breakage. These pencils are thicker than most mechanical pencils, so I had to acclimate myself to the size and figure out how best to hold them. The triangular-barreled Paper Mate 1.3mm lead mechanical pencils are brightly colored with #2 lead. I wanted to love these pencils, but they are only okay. I use pencils to underline books I read, and these were just too hard.
