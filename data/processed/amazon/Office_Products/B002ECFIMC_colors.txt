I like that they come in a few different colors so that I can use the colors to set certain priority to the different folders. The colors are bright and the labels seem to be very well made which is what you would expect from Avery.They peel off easily and attach without any issues. You get four different colors: Blue, Red, Green, and Yellow in a handy note pad style. Bright colors and clear space to write. You get forty of each of the colors: blue, red, green and yellow and they stick just fine. Pretty, bold colors would also work great to label storage boxes, large and small and many other things.Con: I can't really think of any! The colors came in handy for categorization, and the pad made them easier to use. The colors are nice and bright. The colors are bright & easy to see.

Bright colors, 4 labels to a pad -- you can carry the whole pad with you or just pull off a few sheets of labels and carry them with you.The plastic packaging could have been made reusable -- it's great to carry the labels in to keep them from pulling off inside your briefcase your pocket or handbag.

Strong colors: Green, Yellow, Red.
