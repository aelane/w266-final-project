I knew this was a great scanner when I scanned some photos, but where it stands out,(and the reason I bought it,)was in the scanning of my father's slide collection..literally, our life as a family.The Epson V600 not only delivered as it said it would, the quality was astounding,I finished the first "trial run" DVD for my Dad and family,and they just thought it was magic.They can't wait for the next one.This scanner is a valuable tool,I recommend it! As it was an old scanner anyway, I thought it was time for an upgrade. The scanner will actually split the negatives for you, if you tell it to, so you do not have to crop it yourself. I got rid of my last scanner about 12 years ago. Of all those, this is easily the best scanner we've used.So far we've used it for everything from copying simple documents to scanning slides and film that I've been wanting to convert to digital for years. This scanner is ideal for a hobbyist medium format film shooter that doesn't want to pay a fortune for scans, or someone looking to restore a few dozen rolls of film or slides. I bought this scanner, based on all the positive reviews, because I wanted better quality slide and negative scanning than my old Canon.Unfortunately, I didn't get far enough to check that out.My first problem involved scanning documents. I bought this scanner to get the slide scanner capability and to take advantage of amazon prime. This Epson scanner is true to their reputation for excellence but the software is something else. The scanner is definitely 5 stars but the included software sucks. This scanner was easier to install than the basic printer I just bought! If you have ever used a scanner before you probably won't have to refer to the User Guide at all to begin scanning. This V600 Epson Perfection scanner is the little brother to my V700 which handles anything I throw at it with ease and, shall I say, Perfection?Obviously the V600 (in the $250 price range) is no match for the nearly $600 V700, but it has some wonderfully capable functions if you're in need of a not-too-pricey device that can handle your old negatives and slides.
