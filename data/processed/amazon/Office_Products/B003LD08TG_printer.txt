...and we all know that printer ink is one of the most costly liquids on the planet.Like it or not, printers work better when you use new cartridges and ink supplied by the manufacturer. I had an Epson printer before that I used cheap ink refills on. We leave the printer on all the time, so there is no wasteful cleaning blast of ink by repeatedly powering up the printer. This is just a back up for my printer. I have had my Epson printer for about a year and a half and love it. With the printer set on 'draft' and the contrast decreased by 1 notch, this cartridge has been going strong with clean, crisp lines and zero smudging. When your printer runs out of ink, you'll want to buy this. They dry instantly and never smear even if I grab it right off the printer. Sure, printer ink is inherently expensive, but this is the best deal I've found on this expensive item. They work in your printer or they don't. It is January 2013 and my printer is not completely out, just low and I wanted make sure I had a cartridge on hand when it did run out. I love my printer. Epson is THE best printer and this ink is fabulous! I've been happy with this printer and ink in the past so I'm giving two stars instead of one. I love my Epson printer, and the cartridges are one of the really nice things about them. Quick and easy to install in my Epson printer. I can't afford to have the printer fail or replace components due to inferior ink, so I stick to the Epson ink.
