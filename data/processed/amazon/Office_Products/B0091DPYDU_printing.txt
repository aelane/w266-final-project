Photo printing is excellent, although not state of the art. I can say the printing is great. It does regular printing, labels, photos, as well as the all-in-one features, and connects WIRELESSLY to your home network/computer. I have only tried printing from my wireless laptop and not my other devices (namely my Kindle Fire, which I haven't been able to find printing capabilities connected to). 2 sided printing. I don't use it often, but two sided printing using the auto document feeder is a great convenience. Double sided printing, faxing and printing directly from a smart phone  to name a few. This has never once had a wireless printing error or issue either. I also love the double sided printing and never realized how much double siding printing I actually do. )* Remote printing directly to the printer - need to sign a document? This Epson features automatic 2-sided printing and a 30-page, duplex auto document feeder in order to quickly copy, scan or fax stacks of 1- or 2-sided originals. It provides Wireless printing from a Mobile Device: including Apple AirPrint, Google Cloud Print and Epson's own Connect apps. It's important to note that printing was the same between the WorkForce WF-3540 vs. the WorkForce 845 in terms of pages per minute.Single-sided printing was very quick and both earn high marks for printing single and double-sided in color and black and white. I can vouch for the 2 sided printing (which I love because I use much less paper) works flawlessly. The printing, scan, and fax technical specs are identical. But, the printing is really good, the copying and scanning excellent, just not user friendly for a novice. Love it!I am also amazed at the double sided printing!
