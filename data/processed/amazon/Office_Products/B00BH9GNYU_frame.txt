The frame is substantial enough that it makes it look like a quality piece, rather than just an inexpensive white board.Disclosure:  I was given this product for free in return for posting my honest review online via the Amazon Vine program. It has a nice frame around it so it looks good wherever you put it and it has two round, acrylic magnets for attaching notes. Looks attractive... the frame is not wood but sure looks like it.And really, for $10, you can by several of these things to put in targeted areas around the house or office. The frame is a wood-like plastic affair that leaves me yearning for real wood, but you can't have everything and it is a reasonable product for the price. The frame is warped in some areas. The frame is solid and joined well all around, no gaps, no misaligned pieces. The black frame looks very good around this, much more visually appealing than the poorly done white frame around the one this is replacing.It is a better surface than the other one I had as well. The frame is quite thick, so the board is recessed quite a bit from the front surface of the actual frame. However, that bulkier frame is part of what makes this one such a better build quality than the other one, so it's ultimately a wash.The magnets came with some horribly tacky glue holding them to the surface of the board, and that stuff was a real pain to get off of both the board and the magnet, but more so the board because of how that residue interferes with the marker. The frame has a nice finish, is glossy and feels smooth. The black frame adds 1 inch to each edge. The frame is plastic (I received the wood finish) but solid and not flimsy.
