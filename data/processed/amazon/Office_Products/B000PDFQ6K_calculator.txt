After buying this calculator (the Ti-30XS) and I have found out that when using the *10^n key, it uses that as if you wrote x10^3 (EX- 3*10^8 / 5*10^-7 should be 6*10^14 however if you write this in the calculator as shown, it will come up as 6. This is by far the best scientific calculator TI has made yet! The ends up requiring actually &#34;studying&#34; just how to use this calculator using online tutorials etc. We had to purchase another calculator, however, and this one was perfect. I wanted a calculator with buttons that provide good tactile feedback, so I don't have to look at the display to know whether or not the numbers entered are the numbers I intended to enter. And I wanted a calculator that would show me not only the last number entered, but also the earlier numbers in the computation. And I wanted a calculator that would make it easy to raise a number to a power. And I wanted a calculator that would run from ambient lighting, so I don't have to replace the batteries so often.This calculator gave me everything I wanted. It is the first inexpensive calculator I have had that has buttons that feel good when I push them. Incidentally, the calculator also comes with a plastic cover that provides excellent protection for the buttons and the display when the calculator is bouncing around inside your briefcase.

After evaluating the FX-115ES scientific non-graphing calculator and TI-30XS MV, I came to the conclusion that the FX-115ES scientific non-graphing calculator is by FAR the superior calculator.The TI-30XS MV is too basic of a calculator.

So, I looked into getting this calculator.

I like this calculator because it has great lay out, GREAT key feel, (you actually have a solid pronounced feel of hitting a button vs. a spongy push)nice style (though who cares) and it has a nice memory/log of what you've been typing in.
