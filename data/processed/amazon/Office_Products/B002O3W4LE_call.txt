The call quality is crystal clear. If I get a call from a number I want to block, I just go to my profile page on their website and add it to my blacklist. He hooked up his Telo and gave me a call with it and it sounded great. A call comes in, I log into my Ooma online control panel and click the blacklist icon. I had to call 911 recently, and my call was routed to a center that did not get my address automatically, but did send an ambulance when I told them where to send it to. Other than that the call quality is very good, as good as a land line traditional phone. You can enable call blocking have voice to text messages and lots of other features. I particullary like the call blocking abilities - Ooma maintains a blacklist of call spammers and you can add to it...  Has greatly cut down on problem calls Get a call from a telemarketer? You can always send a call to voicemail by pushing the voicemail button on the Telo, and the voicemail happens on ooma servers, so it will always record nicely. Every now and then a call isn't as good as you would like. When my call is being routed to a standard TDM phone, the call does not seem to have any noticeable delay.$200 up front for Telo is steep, but worth the spend. So far the call has always worked on the second attempt, but me and my callers really shouldn't need to try multiple times.Got this at Costco for a good price and the unlimited return policy. Basically, if you get a call from an anonymous number, one where there's no caller ID, or where the Ooma users have collectively decided was spam, the Ooma won't disturb you by ringing your phones. It supports disabling call wiating per call, allows over 3 on a party, and With free Google Voice support, it can be cheaper (without 911 support).

Still not a single dropped call that I can remember.

I did try to place a call one day to a restaurant and the call would not ring through.

Or you can do it from the call log as people call.
