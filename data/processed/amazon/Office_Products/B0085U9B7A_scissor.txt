I'm not sure how well the scissor mouse will hold up over time.I attempted using it on regular paper and wrapping paper. The scissor mouse sounded like a good idea; in actual use, it's way more trouble than it's worth. This scissor mouse is simple to use and is quite reliable at cutting straight and smooth edges. When I saw the scissor mouse, I thought it might be the answer to my prayers. Did the scissor mouse help address this problem? Unfortunately this scissor mouse does have some shortcomings and the cutting mechanism (as others have stated) is prone to breaking with minimal scuffle. While the scissor mouse purports to make things easier, my wife and I found things more difficult. The scissor mouse works best if you are just cutting medium thickness paper which lays flat on a table surface. The scissor mouse is a clever gadget that works fairly well.

This made the typical scissor approach so much easier.

The new Westcott scissor mouse is a rather ingenious design.
