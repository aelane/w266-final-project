The bottle will probably outlast the shredder. If I am still alive when this bottle is empty, then I will consider myself lucky. I bought one bottle, learned it was just vegetable oil, and now refill this bottle with vegetable oil -- it does help to have a good dispensing bottle -- so you may want to purchase this and refill like I did. I could not find a bottle with a long nozzle in my area. I'll be refilling the bottle with cheap vegetable oil. Trust me, I messed one up by not oiling it.This bottle will last a lifetime. Well I can say it is in a nice bottle. This is a big bottle of light weight oil for a paper shredder. It came with a small bottle of oil that actually lasted me quite a while. But, when I was ready, I ordered this large bottle of oil and keep it in the compartment on the back of my shredder, so that it is always right there for when it is time to empty the basket and oil again.As I mentioned, this is a LOT of oil and will last a very, very long time for home use and quite a while for office use as well. It comes in a nice, sturdy bottle with a little stopper top that stays on perfectly fine as long as you aren't tossing the bottle around. Maybe you could just buy a bottle of some other kind of oil, but I think it is worth those few dollars to have a bottle with the thin tip for easy application and I don't have to remember to run to the kitchen to get some oil, pour it into something that makes it easier to apply, and then have another dish to wash. I'm guessing 1 bottle of this stuff will last years. When it runs out, I will buy this larger bottle which should last several years, just to have a nicer bottle/applicator. And then when that runs out, I will refill this bottle with grocery store canola oil, which is a better value.But really, this large bottle should last years unless it's being used in a very high volume corporate shredder or something like that. I purchased a much smaller bottle (less than half the size of this one) for $6 and change from my local Home Depot.
