Now that I have a small pack stuck to my laptop, I've been able to ditch my pack of Post-its from my bag and use this smaller, lighter dispenser. This new little pack, not so much.This was my first time using the accordian style Post-its and I have to ask "why?" This three pack has plain yellow post-it notes and the cardboard-like dispensers, in various pretty colors, have a sticky back for placement wherever you need them. I installed one pack on my laptop and never realized how handy a note could be until I wanted to write a URL on a piece of scrape paper. I applied another pack to an area close to the wheel but out of the way so that when I filled the gas tank I had a piece of paper to write the data about the gas filling. I have a pack of post-its in my dayplanner inside a plastic pouch that holds 50 that I can purchase inexpensively. The initial pack comes with only very few sheets, but can be filled again as we run through these.Nice size, features, ease of use; helps you get organized/remember things. This three pack is very stylish and best of all practical.

The pack comes with all 3 colors (green, hot pink, black).

They come in a pack of three envelopes so I also put one inside my daily planner and they are so thin that it doesn't make it poof up or not close.

I bought a pack of these for my wife and I to stick to our laptops.
