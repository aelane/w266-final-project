The pens have a rubber skin on the translucent barrel for a comfortable grip. These are decent pens. But these pens are light years smoother than the Slicci.My wife has had operations on her right hand, and she is picky over how a pen feels in her hand. I have been extremely impressed with these pens. What I like most about these pens is that they do not smudge easily after writing. However, as I started having to use pens to sign off on numerous documents quickly, I had to return to ball points because all the roller balls I could find smudged to easily. My pens are black (the package says "Black, Noir, Negro," the only chic color for serious business. These pens are pretty good - they make for comfortable writing even over long periods of time. Rollerball pens usually are too scratchy, so I stick to Pilot Gel Pens, with the occasional fountain pen. These are the first pens I've ever used that allow me to write as quickly as I want with having to worry about smearing the wet ink across the page (and across the side of my hand as well. I'm quite satisfied with this Uni-ball pens. I'm pretty impressed with these pens and would buy them in the future. As with most pens, the higher the quality of the paper, the better the pen will work. These pens write well on newsprint. These are by far my favorite pens. The pens write smoothly right out of the package. The pens even made my handwriting a bit more legible. Uniball Jetstreams are my absolute favorite pens, and the only ones I buy anymore because of how smoothly they write. Remember the old hard-sided Bic pens which created pressure ridges on your fingers? But since I buy all the pens for the house, I won't be buying Jetstreams. There are other pens that glide more easily. These pens have quickly become my favorite.The benefits? So I'm always trying to find pens that help me out in that area (which leads me to using ballpoint pens mostly or quick drying inks!). These pens are comfortable to hold, with a rubbery-feeling barrel. These pens look neat and I had only one problem. I wouldn't get these pens again. These pens are very good. I have pens. Honestly, I usually don't have any Uni-ball pens, but, hey, these were free and I thought I'd give 'em a try.The pens work fantastically well, the ink holds to the page and doesn't smear and overall they're fantastic. It wasn't nearly as bad as many other pens I've used over the years, but it wasn't perfect.So, a pen is a pen is a pen. I just love these pens. These pens have rubberized bodies which makes them comfortable to hold. These new Uni-ball Jetstream 101 Bold pens came in a pack with three different colors - black, blue, and red - which in and of itself is a helpful feature.I cannot detect anything pro or con compared to the normal roller ball pens. First, I long ago stopped using capped pens since the caps seem to disappear in my house, and I find click pens quicker and more convenient. Probably not, but I find myself reaching for the pens that don't have caps regardless.The bigger issue is the feel and look of the ink. These pens are of a much higher quality than your ordinary everyday Bic. Personally, I like how smoothly these pens write. So I'm uptight about my pens. These pens are nice. These pens are good for their relatively low price. All in all, I'd recommend these pens for casual use. I found these pens to be very smooth in writing. But unlike felt-tip pens or other 'streaming' type pens that I've tried, they do NOT bleed through the paper, and they dry VERY quickly! These Jet Stream 101 pens don't disappoint! Each of the pens tested maintained a smooth, fine line with no extraneous leaks and no tacky residue.The rubberized barrel is comfortable to grip, though I prefer a more solid chamber. This is like the Timex of pens. The Uni-ball Jetstream 101 Bold Point Rollerball Pens are the most wonderful pens I have used in a long time. Unlike other pens that don't always start producing ink the minute you start writing, these pens do. I got these pens for my Mom, who is older, and she loved the way they felt in her hand and loved the additional colors in the pack as well. They are pretty good pens and I'll use them up, but there are a few things I don't like about them:- I prefer a retractable pen without a cap. I really enjoyed using these pens. I wouldn't say that the pens are completely smear-free because there are occasional "blobs," but part of that might be my own writing style (pressing pens down firmly). I love these pens. I definitely liked using these pens. These are great pens!

These pens have a much more rounded ball like tip - much like a ball point pen.

(Better than regular pens, regardless...)I very likely will be purchasing these pens in the future; they really are smooth!

I took these pens for a spin.
