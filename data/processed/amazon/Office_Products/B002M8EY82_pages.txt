It can easily staple 30 pages (even using only one finger, as the promotional materials claim, though I don't know anyone who actually staples with one finger).The only drawback is the lack of instructions. Overall if you don't need to staple more than 28 pages, I highly recommend this stapler compared to others I've used including the PaperPro Professional 65. At around 30 pages, the hold gets a little tenuous,  but since the specification only calls for 28 sheets, that is okay.It is very easy to refill. Blasting through 30 pages takes about the same effort as two.It came in one of those clamshell containers. The more pages you have to staple, the more physical strength you must use. And the more pages you have, the lower the chance the staple will actually succeed. For up to 28 pages of standard laser paper - which is what I tried it with - it works flawlessly, every time. It is almost effortless even when stapling through 20-25 pages. Will staple 28 pages using standard staples (yes, I counted out 28 shetts of paper). Works well and can staple up to 25 pages with the push of one finger which is very nice.

It does what it claims I tested it and yes it will staple 28 pages with just the touch of a finger.

(I actually put in 30 pages on my first try and it worked like a charm.
