Just put them on the desk, and the very light suction cup action works as you pull straight up on the tape. I really didn't understand what the desk dispeners were when I ordered this product, and if you find yourself in the same boat, let me explain...The round items in the product picture are the desk dispensers. So let me try the desk one...Try as I might, I would not get the "deskgrip" to grip my desk, or actually the folding plastic table I was wrapping on. Also if you have a small desk then you can eliminate your much larger regular tape dispenser. The desk ones are OK but I end up covering them too often and had to try and find them under the paper. And knowing it won't mar my desk is great. You temporarily attach them to your desk, table, etc. The desk dispenser is MUCH easier when actually doing desktop taping.Bottom line: Nice set. The desk dispenser is ok, it stays on the desk, but can slide around, sometimes you have to hold it down to get the tape out which kinda defeats the purpose of being able to grab it one handed. I'm assuming it wasn't meant to stick to the desk, but hold it down when you go to pull the tape out. I'm disappointed that you are not supposed to refill the desk dispenser. It hasn't mysteriously migrated across the desk or the table. The Scotch Pop-Up Tape Dispenser comes with two desk dispensers, two dispensers that can slip into your hand and refill.Loading the dispenser:Well, I actually had trouble loading one of the hand dispenses. The desk dispensers stick nicely to most any surface, but are more challenging to refill than the wrist straps because the cover is more stubborn and must be pushed in just the right spot to pop it off without cracking the plastic.The tape strips are great! I have one on my desk and I have used it several times already and the tape is there ready to go.There is a lot of refills in the package also.For the price its a great buy and will really save you time, and tape too, since the pieces are the perfect size already for you! It mounts to your desk with a suction-cup-like device. If Scotch made the desk dispensers refillable, the same way that they made the handband dispensers refillable, this would be a five star review. This should be more appropriately called the desk floating dispenser. the desk dispenser has two tape stripes already enclosed and there are further 6 refills (10 tape stripes in total)' there is no tape strip in the hand dispenser.
