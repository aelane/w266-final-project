These Post-It labels appear to have about the same adhesive as regular Post-Its, only across the entire back instead of just the edge. However, you cannot label it for long, because the labels come off at the faintest encouragement, no matter what surface they are on. These removable labels are an even better option:1. We can now label with the Sharpie Markers, making the labels easier to read than when we used pencils.3. I am very pleased with these labels. ), I am always putting new labels on boxes. Permanent labels are nice but when you want to rename a box, removing the label only tears away the box material. The labels do come off cleanly and stick to a variety of surfaces, which leads me to my other favorite thing about these labels.I have three external hard drives I rotate when backing up my computer and like to label them with the date so I know which is the oldest one (that will be reused for the next backup). These labels stick well to the case and do not fall off even when jostled around in a drawer. These labels are great for that as they stay put. Both labels in this pack have the right size and (bright) color. These labels attach easily, stay on as long as one desires, and remove cleanly without damaging surfaces--the one exception to this is that I put it on a very old (35 years old! So these labels definitely pass the test for versatility!I could see a bunch of uses for these, but they seem especially useful when you want to label something for a time period and then remove the label--for example moving or organizing things. Usually labels fall off those. These labels stick on well and, just as importantly, come off easily. I absolutely love these labels, but I only hope Post-It comes out with some nicer colors for storage labels as so far I've just seen bright colors that are a bit shocking. EDIT 6/16/13I REALLY love these labels!!! I wish it came with a few more labels but otherwise am very happy with the product. These  labels are on standard post-it note weight paper, but have stickiness on the whole backside, instead of just across the top. The labels are easy to spot. I used these labels to organize the boxes of baby clothes and toys she is too old for. What was so great about these labels is that I can move them around without damaging the box or label. I love these sticky labels!At work, we have small parts which we inventory occasionally. We used to make labels from regular 3x3 Sticky Notes, but they only last a week or so at best, then flutter to the ground. Remarkably simple but very effective, these labels stick just like Post-its (same adhesive), only there's more of it for longer tackiness. Hard to wax really eloquent on labels, but these are efficient, super-sticky, and bright. The labels work even better as post its since they have mostly the entire writing surface as a super stick note. Unfortunately Post it was not first in making these labels, Avery beat them by a few months and the Avery Labels come in more sedate colors which I prefer. These "labels" are basically post-it notes with the sticky stuff covering the whole note. If you need to make labels to stick on things such as file boxes or other larger items...this may fit the bill. Price aside, these labels do everything I would have imagined they might, and thus I cannot say anything bad about them. What is there to say about labels? I'm using these as labels on plastic containers and on files. I can then remove the labels and reuse the box over and over. They stick tight but remove cleanly so that you can change your labels when the contents of the container changes.The people at 3M clearly spend a lot of time asking themselves "What sort of products do real people need and how will they use them?"

*****These labels made by Post-It are everything you'd want in a removable label.

Perfect for labels but don't accidentally get them to use as regular Post-its, like I did, because the entire back is sticky and they don't work well for notes.

I really love these labels; they are just the right size to use on folders and small organizing boxes.
