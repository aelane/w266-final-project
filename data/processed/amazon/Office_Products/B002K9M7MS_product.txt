In reviewing this product, I have decided to focus on two areas: how well they do with inkjet, laser printers and pens, and how well they stick. All in all, a very good product. Good, solid product---just as you'd expect. Great product. This is a great product. As a product reviewer, trader and seller, I do a decent amount of shipping. I would probably go with a different product for printing address labels. 3M is always reliable, and this is another great product. I LOVE that this product is made in the USA. This superior product is also less expensive than Avery labels so there's not need to pay three plus dollars more for Avery shipping labels. 3M is a product you can rely on. I am happy with the product and price. I mention this because the Avery product is now advertising "true block" technology to correct this on the labels. This is a very easy product to use. You can specify product 3100-S. I used this product to ship a series of packages, and was pleased with the results. All in all a good product and one I'd use again. Another 3M reliable worthwhile product! There's not much to say about a product like this, because it's so basic that the manufacturer can either fail miserably, or succeed perfectly. Predictably, this product is no exception. A very good product that I recommend for anyone that has shipping to do. Great little product! Can't imagine why any 3M product would need to be reviewed. Sometimes it's nice to find a product that's actually as good as advertised.
