The ink cartridges are smaller without being significantly less expensive. This gray ink cartridge is difficult to acquire, and must be custom ordered from Canon. I was unable to complete purchasing the gray ink online, and had to call Canon directly in order to get the ink. I was startled to find that this gray ink was the first tank to run out when I was printing my cards.While I am discussing the ink, there is one subject that is food for thought. The small black ink tank is running out, and I am not sure how to force the machine to drink from the large black ink tank. The ink cartridges are color coded and fit in place easily. Moreover, the ink inside the cartridges may not be of the same quality.If you decide to go the way of non-OEM cartridges, make sure that you use a reputable vendor. The ink didn't fade or run. I looked up ChromoLife 100+ which is the ink used by this Canon printer. I was horrified, thinking of all the ink that had been wasted! So I got some free ink out of this exchange, too. I know replacement ink cartridges are going to be expensive, but then name a printer whose ink isn't.. that's how the companies make their profits. I feel like I'm always buying ink for it.
