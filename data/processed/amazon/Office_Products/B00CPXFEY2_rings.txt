The rings stay closed, and it's easy to open and close. I like that it lies absolutely flat when opened, and that the rings seem pretty durable. The rings come apart easy enough, but also snap firmly together so that you won't worry about losing anything. The rings can hold 200 sheets of paper and they close nice and tight without a gap so your papers stay put. The rings are also "never-gap" rings. No more misaligned or gapping rings to disrupt the pages. The rings are easy to open-and-close, and notes can be stored in the inner pockets. The rings are placed on the back cover internally and the edges of the spine are very reinforced--I even made a few hard tugs on them and no noticeable distress resulted. The rings themselves close and shut well so I think this will withstand standard use and will certainly withstand holding some of the research papers.And the color selection is impressive, too, since I get tired of white binders all blending together on my shelves. The rings are better quality and easier to use than the typical rings which sometimes can grab paper or your fingers. The rings have an interesting design with a small protusion on one side that feeds into a hold on the other side. The rings seem to snap open and closed pretty well, but compared to the heavier duty binders I have on my shelf, this is more comparable to something you'd find in the dollar bin at the grocery store, and not in an office supply store for this high price. The rings have a pin on one face that mates with a hole on the other face to keep pages from finding their ways through a gap.This two-pocket binder, with its custom cover sleeves does seem a bit costly for what it is, but it is a decent quality product. The rings themselves close nicely. The rings, so far, haven't gone askew, and that's probably the most important thing in any binder. It's relatively easy to open and close the rings, although it could be easier. I also don't like when the rings don't line up well and the papers can get caught or slip out.Having said that, this binder addresses both those issues by having the rings affixed to the back cover of the binder so that when you close it, the papers are already laying flat against the back. And the rings are easy to open with no gaps between them.But, my binder arrived with some nick marks on the back and the crease of the back/spine hinge. When closed the rings feel really solid. The rings are sturdy and open and close easily, but overall quality of construction is lacking in several areas.- The plastic laminate over the cardboard is bubbling up in a few places - it appears it was not applied correctly.- The binder will not close properly - the rings are mounted about a quarter inch too close to the spine so that when closed the top and bottom edges of the binder do not line up.- The clear plastic over-sleeve is not smooth and has a slightly warped appearance.In an inexpensive binder (the price was just over nine dollars at the time of my order) I wouldn't be so critical, but at this price I expect a better constructed product. The rings are not on the spine, but on the back cover, which I always prefer, but are round, not d-ring which is typical in that construction. The rings line up well and are easy to open and close. The rings are advertised as "never gap", but I don't think this tends to be an issue in anything but the cheapest of binders in my experience anyway. The rings can be closed either by hand or with the the opening mechanism. The rings inside are circular, not D-shaped, which some people prefer.
