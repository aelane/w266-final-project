I haven't tried the magnets to hang it, but the sticker labels work very well. The magnets for the back of the board are not strong enough to firmly hold the board, and it slides down my fridge if you bump the board at all. If one does not choose to use the magnets, there is double sided tape that can be applied directly to the wall....with the knowledge that it might take off paint or paper if used that way, but that is just common sense. The magnets are an added bonus to hold other notes. It needs stronger magnets or at the very least larger ones. I had to attach an additional two magnets I already owned to the back of it using the two sided tape that came with the board. I don't use the magnets that came with it but they are cute. I prefer the magnets so I can move it if necessary and so I can clean behind it. The magnets could be stronger or you might need more of them if you fridge is opened often or slammed by family members.It also comes with a single black dry erase marker with an eraser top. It was super easy to attach the mounting magnets - apply the sticky pads to the back of each corner, then stick the magnets on. It comes with magnets if you'd like to attach it to a metal surface, or two-sided sticky pads if not. The magnets attach to the sticky pads.
