I'm about the bold colors, but if you don't hate the pastels then obviously their strong presence won't bother you like it does me.The ultra fine tip is a pro and a con. Some colors show through on the other side of the page on mine, although my Bible does have very thin pages. With all the colors of the spectrum, the perfect color is available for any home or art project. With 36 colors, I had all the colors I needed or wanted.These markers have lasted quite awhile and through many projects. The 36 colors cover a good range, and the set has many different shades in the same color.My thoughts:~the "case" is really big and clunky and takes up a lot of space, both open (to three panels) and closed. The colors are terrific and offer a broad range of choices. The BIC Mark-It Color Ultra Fine Permanent Marker set comes 36 widely assorted colors. Each of the colors we have used has dried true to the color band & clip on its pen. The colors are vibrant and match the indicator on the marker very well. And these are NOT Pantone-coded colors. (If you really need certain colors, that's the only way you'll get "matches. The colors are vibrant. They're comfortable to hold and the colors are vivid. Thus far, I've been able to find the right colors for my needs. Just looking at all the colors is a nice experience. "36" colors is a decent start, but there are so many more hues to be had!Overall they totally deserve 5 stars. The colors are not shown in the web description, but they are printed on the back of the package. The colors are vivid and you can buy them in open stock at most art and hobby stores. First, there are so many different colors and shades you can get really creative with them. The colors are organized into classic, pastel, and jewel-toned. There are several colors with pastel caps, but the colors are not pastel at all. If you need lighter colors, regular art markers are probably best. So many colors to choose from, 36 to be exact. Multiple colors are good for making posters and decorating but some of the colors are too light, others seem like repeats because there is very little difference in them. And 36 colors, including pastels, with permanent ink is an excellent range.
