I used to have a rather large dry erase board on my fridge, but I got rid of it because it made my refrigerator look a bit cluttered and messy. Nice to have both the dry erase board and the pen able to &#34;stick&#34; to the refrigerator or any other metal surface.Cons: The purple dry erase board wouldn't stay on my refrigerator. A large dry erase board for my scheduled items, paper lists, grocery list, etc.I got these for my short lists. I had other dry erase markers here. These small dry erase boards are perfect for creating understated to-do or grocery store lists on the refrigerator. This is a great little dry erase magnet board that's a bit on the small side. I have a much larger wall-mounted, magnetic dry erase board that I'll also stick one of these mini ones onto. Easy to write on, very easy and clean erase.

They work well with all the dry erase markers we've tried, and they look nice in our kitchen too.

It's like &#34;dry erase inception&#34;.Some people say that the lavender one is too dark.

I grabbed some other dry erase pens with more contrast, and those have been great, though for the purple board, I do have to be pickier about pen color if I want the writing to be easy to read.
