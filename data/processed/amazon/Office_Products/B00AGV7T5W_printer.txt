This is my 3rd Canon printer & I really like the results. I received this printer last week and I'm very pleased with it so far.I have been using an older Canon printer for my personal needs, so this has been a nice upgrade.Taking it out of the package and setting it up was easy, and took me less than 10 minutes. We have wi-fi and the printer found the wireless network practically by itself.Less than 5 minutes later I used the air print feature and printed a pdf file and a picture of my daughter directly from my iphone. Thankfully, this printer has wi-fi, so I can place it farther away from my immediate desk area which is already too crowded with 7 hard drives, 2 printers and a landline telephone. I broke my previous printer trying to get out a paper jam, and decided to get a smaller one that had all the features I needed and none that I don't. Pretty nice little printer all in all, at least when using as a casual printer and not for serious work.Pros:  * Business documents look nice and are quick to print. The printer seems to be thriftywhen it comes to ink usage, I've used about 1/3rd of these cartridges after 200 or so color pages, many graphicin nature. The printer only comes with starter cartridges so you might as well order ink with the printer. I have a Canon Multifunction printer that I have never gotten to work right after upgrading to Lion (but it works with Windows on my Macs), and two photo printers for work I sell. When I used the printer to double sided print a page it seemed to get snagged in the printer. I have another printer but this one seems like it was not made as well as my Cannon Pixma 6220 pinter. This second printer has to be in a pull-out drawer in my desk, so all the color laser printers were too high, as were most of the inkjet ones too.Fortunately, I came across this, which is just the perfect size to fit. Somehow, this printer is very very slow to get ready for printing. AirPrint Compatible (C11CC33201)- my workhorse printer around the house for printing, faxing, scanning, etc. The printer was well packaged and wrapped up, and comes with ink cartridges of each variety needed, power cable, driver disc, 3 pieces of photo glossy paper (more on this soon), and some special paper for alignment.Pros:- The setup was super simple. This was so frustrating on an old HP printer I had, and is a simple, elegant solution.- The photo prints are extremely impressive, especially on the photo paper. I preferred the printer. It can all be done from the printer directly, and it will send the output to the installed computer. This is the first Canon printer I have owned (having previously used Lexmark and Epson). Also, this is the first printer that I have owned that seems to have been designed as a photo printer.Obviously, the primary interest in a printer is how well it prints - and this Canon MG5420 handles the usual documents well and also outputs high quality photo prints. I haven't had this printer for very long, so I can't say for sure exactly how often ink needs to be changed (and of course it will depend on how often you print). Whatever printer you buy, you really want to make sure it has separate canisters for each color.- When you do need to replace ink on this Canon, it is a very simple process.- For this specific printer, the ink tanks are labeled Canon #250 and #251. This printer works with Windows and Mac. Voila, I now had my wireless printer. The printer did a great job printing from my IPod Touch - the photo quality was excellent. My previous printer was a Canon MP610, and it ran flawlessly from 2008 until early 2014. To wake the printer, I had to press the OK button on it. The most reliable and solid printer I have ever owned is a Canon Pixma i4500 which sits on my desk and is wired directly to my personal computer. It has been more dependable than any HP or Epson printer I have used and I have used and abused it for years. Overall, this is a decent printer for moderate use and is worth a look. Not restricted to just copy, printer, or photo paper, you can also print onto CDs and DVDs. But, if you're considering this printer, and have already done your homework, that just might not be a concern for you. This is a solidly-built printer with enough features and options to satisfy everyone from the average home user to the amateur photographer, and perhaps even the professional photographer that's just starting up. They have a higher priced printer but why buy it (along with the ungodly ink costs-here it is:Canon PIXMA PRO-100  Color Professional Inkjet Photo Printer? This printer has remarkable clarity, smoothness and true-to-life colors. This printer is a sweet spot providing a great return of investment for home users. This printer is intended to be an all around general purpose multi-function device, in my opinion, for use in a home/family user environment. I setup this printer in the following environment:  home network on a Belkin wireless router, Win 7 laptop (wireless), Win 7 desktop (wired network), Win 7 desktop (wireless on second floor) 3 Ipad's (wireless), 3 Iphones (wireless), in a two story house.Though I would not want to drop it, this printer has decent build quality with a manageable footprint (18.0x14.6x5.9 inches), making it suitable for placement even in the kitchen (typical hub of the house). The printer menu interface/navigation is easy to use even though it is not touch screen (which reportedly fail more often than not). I color calibrated the printer to my monitor using third-party software and Data Color Spyder Pro. Overall, it's a good printer. The printer works great and the print is clear and not smudged at all. Had this printer hooked up in moments. I came from a MX870 Canon printer which did the same, so no issues for me.Print speed was actually faster than my old MX870, and was pleased of this, but this system is for the home, and I do not do business matters that need faster print speed anyway. Overall, the printer is working as I hoped for, but a one day review is not enough for most, so I will be back with some added remarks.Edit for additional information:  Used this system for about 3 days now. Over all the printer is working well, no real complaints other than I do wish Canon would look into making a printer that was quieter. I can't guarantee that this printer is going to be any better in the long run, but the set-up actually works pretty well if you use the standard version, not the WPS... and I'm getting way ahead of myself on this one.To begin with, the printer requires a lot of time for set-up. Visually, the printer is nice and sleek. This was the first printer I've had (and I've had dozens!)

This printer uses a 5 ink system, which gives the photos better color quality, accuracy and saturation.

I am using this as a second printer in a second room to augment my primaryEpson WorkForce 845 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer, Copier, Scanner, Fax, iOS/Tablet/Smartphone/AirPrint Compatible (C11CB92201).

This Canon printer does an excellent job, but  set-up frustrated me.~~~~Annoyances:Set-Up: First - for wireless LAN set-up  I was instructed to put the printer next to my PC and the access point.
