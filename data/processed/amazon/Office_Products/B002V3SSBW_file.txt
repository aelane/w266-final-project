!No more losing hanging file folder labels in the bottom of your file drawer. I am so impressed with how easy they do slide onto the hanging file folders. I love to keep myself organized and have 5 file cabinets to prove it! This makes the file drawer super easy to find things and looks good while doing so...the tabs do slide where you wnat them without punching in certain tabs or holes. They make using my hanging file floders much more easy since they move / slide. You could use them on any file folders. They don't fall off by themselves and get lost in your file drawer. These Smead file tabs are much better than the ones I previously used - the type that slipped into the slots of the hanging files. What more could you want in a file folder tab? and they adhere to the file folder very well. I use them on hanging file folders and I am able to easily see what files are what, and use the tabs themselves to flip through to the file I want.I have to keep track of my mother's finances and other business since she is no longer able too, and these help a lot in keeping track of where and what all her various files are. While they definitely seem easier to place and move than traditional file folder tabs, they are also less sturdy when installed.One thing I noticed is that a lot of the tabs had areas of damage on them when they arrived. All without actually taking it off of the hanging file. These are great for organizing one's file folders!

As I was pleasantly surprised to find out, these tabs no longer need to be slid into the hanging file folder slots like the traditional tabs.This simple, but yet innovative design makes it as easy as push down on the tab and slide the little divots over the slots to hold it in place.

For hanging file folders, these tabs are the way to go.

They are compatible with any hanging file folder.
