Sticks well, lasts a long time, unobtrusive and you can write on it. It lasts a really long time! So at the time of this writing there are about 156 reviews saying how great this tape is. I like to buy at least 3 at a time so I can keep them in several spots-- two in drawers and one in a bag with my wrapping supplies. It's that time of year again...when tape is destined for the present wrapping. It's that time of year again. Works great every time. It would allow me time to read the books and listen to the hundreds of CDs that have as yet to receive my undivided attention.

And since the last time I checked the shelf life of tape is like, a zillion years, and you're always looking around for where the tape dispenser is, it's not too much of a stretch to buy a three pack to have around the house.

I use it all the time.

Being that it is Christmas time a majority of it has been used wrapping presents.
