They are made so that the white tab insert goes in easily and fits snugly. The Slide tab is more opaque than the plastic tab, so, visually, hand printed tabs are slightly more difficult to read. These fold and tuck into the tab without any problems. This sliding tab is easy to use on my hanging files. This not only allows them to perform the standard tab function well, but also allows them to be used for other purposes. Instead, they secure the tab from flipping off or being pulled off.The base of the plastic tab is sealed off from the top where the paper insert will be, so there is no opening the tab up to slide the paper insert inside and that makes inserting it a bit of an effort at times, but the durability makes it worthwhile in my opinion. You just snap the tab onto the hanging folder and you can slide it back and forth to get it in the optimal position. SO EASY!But just remember you need to flex the tab back a little to get it to slide. This stops the tab from moving once you have set it where you want. To reposition the tab you just flex it away from you and move again to a new spot.

Once positioned, the tab then is slid down to snap into place into three notches below.

Slide the tab down onto the folder until it fits into the grooves.

They're MUCH easier to adjust then the old tab style.These tabs are definitely an upgrade over the old style and now I can easily find what I want.
