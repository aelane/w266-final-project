But, for carrying multiple files from point A to point B without worrying about papers falling out, this is a quick and easy method. Yes, it keeps the files upright, and yes, it fits normal size folders, but its high sides made it difficult to see the tabbed folders inside. And when full, it is difficult to lift all the files out because the handles aren't good enough for one-handed lifting. Because most hanging files are legal-sized, this box will be too small for many file cabinets.Amazon sends books, CDs, and other items through the mail on thicker cardboard than this. In it, I was able to transport a few files, papers, a legal pad (standing up right) and a few additional things to my meeting. I emptied out my files and put in the ream of paper. Fantastic for keeping files for one project together. However, most of us have more than a few files to store between bank records, warrantees, receipts, tax forms etc. It is large enough to hold files, notebooks and binders, but small enough to fit in a filing cabinet.It is especially good when combined with one of Smead MO filing kits, which are probably featured above.The one drawback is that it is a little pricey for what is basically a cardboard box. The files have oversized tabs and are staggered so that all of the tabs can be read at once. If you don't care whether it's acid-free or not, then I think you will be pleased with it, because it truly is handy for storing files and papers and carrying them around. I hate hanging files for many reasons I won't bother to enumerate. Holds several files and can be convenient inexpensive storage for files
