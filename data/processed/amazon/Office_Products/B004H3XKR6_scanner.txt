Fortunately, you can use the scanner software on the computer to configure a more manual document scan. The scanner is very high quality as well and scans at a high resolution quickly and without fuss using either the flatbed or automatic document feeder. The scanner, meanwhile, has a thoroughly workable 2400 dpi maximum resolution.The fax speed is 33.6 kbps (not that one has a lot of opportunity to send and receive faxes these days) and its got a nicely designed photo viewing screen and LED prompts.The all-in-one comes complete with a CD-ROM with drivers and bonus software, telephone cord, manual, sample paper pack and four DURABrite Ultra Ink cartridges.But you're going to have to provide your own USB cable. I had a ScanSnap that I had to lend out, and it left me seriously needing another scanner. I have worked mostly with the scanner, scanning files to both my computer wirelessly and to a jump drive plugged into the WorkForce 840 directly. )Anyway, if you try to do this wirelessly, the scanner doesn't work with the MacBooks. Just lift the scanner top. The scanner door isn't double hinged but it can still scan from books and the final result can be cropped. With the scanner door open, it's about 22" tall. I thought the Scansnap was the best scanner around and actually have purchased over 20 of them for my office, but at their cost, I am going to start replacing them with the Epson at a fraction of the cost. It's a great scanner and copier (perhaps fax as well, but I cut home phone service ages ago), and it's printing features go way beyond the basic. "***  The scanner works perfectly and you can control the function from the computer and save to the computer or a memory card, you can save as jpg or tiff, or create a PDF from your scan. You can even scan to e-mail (the scanner scans, opens your e-mail program, and attaches your image to the e-mail).AS A FAX:*** Works as a free-standing fax machine, where you would load the paper, dial the number, and send and receive faxes using the machine's controls just as you did with your old fax machine (except that this one is a little more interactive and the little window keeps you informed and keeps giving you options and instructions).

Did you seriously expect the scanner and fax options in an all-in-one printer to somehow be revolutionized in the span of the last 5 years (when I had my last all-in-one printer)?

You have to open Preview and import it to Preview from the scanner.
