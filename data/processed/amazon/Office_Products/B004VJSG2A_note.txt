For note takers, keep in mind that 2x0.5 inches is a fairly small space, so if you want to leave detailed notes, you have to use bigger stickies. What can I say about a sticky note? I like to take note of words I don't know the meaning of and I usually stick a Post-it inside the book cover to write them down on. You can also write a small note on he paper if needed. It shouldn't be too hard to make good little note stickers, and Avery did. Regardless, I used to cut a sticky note in small pieces and then tape them to my pens. Not much more to say about a sticky note. I have noticed that Avery is trying to edge out Post-it in the removable note market! Just large enough for me to write a small note on them if I want to later remember why I wanted to flag it in the first place.

I like them because I can scribble a note on them and stick them on a page I want to come back to when I review a book.

They are simple to write on if you want to make a note of your marked page.

They are handy when you don't want a whole sticky note, perfect for marking a place and drawing your attention to it.
