Ever tried to write a pertinent note on those little sticky notes, while using the note as a bookmark for later reference? These Post-It note tabs are great for organization freaks. I have several note books that I use regularly;  with these Post-it tabs I mark the sections I'm currently working on, re-locating them as needed. The post-it note market is huge. A post-it note is a post-it note ! These are really nifty note tabs that are useful for the right application such as separating books, papers, binders, calendars, recipes, stacks of paper, etc. into sections4 - They are reuseable5 - You get 50 note tabs in a package (25 of each color)6 - You have a pretty large surface area to write on the lined portion of the post-it and the ability to label the colored tabWhat I don't like:1 - The tabs are not see-through so you may be covering up text because the surface area of the tabs are large2 - I think the cost is a little too high for what you getFor the right application, these can be very useful. These also seem quite expensive for the 50 note tabs in the package. These are okay, but I prefer a regular post-it note to make references on, and I preferAvery NoteTabs(TM) 2 inch x 1.5 inch Neon Blue and Magenta, 40 per packto use for tabs. I use these note tabs for marking books and notebooks. These Post-It note tabs are cute for organizing binders and file folders without damaging them. These note tabs are wonderful for those of us who don't want to write in our books but do want to make notes at the page without having endless scraps of paper falling out.
