This "system" binder is not a planner, nor is it something that you can combine with a planner into one notebook. Because the Pendaflex system has its own channel strip lock to hold its inserts, you cannot insert anything (other than into the front flap) that is non Pendaflex.2. This "system" binder is not low profile. This "system" binder is made of hard plastic (called Flex Poly). The "system" binder is attractive with kind of a industrial mesh look.2. I was somewhat skeptical that this system would offer any advantage to standard 3-ring binders with media pouches, but after using the system to organize the materials for a video project (we make professional instructional videos) I am pleasantly surprised how well it works.The system is modular, utilizing a channelized spine (8 slots) with a locking mechanism that securely holds the "Filing Tool" inserts you want to use. My previous system was a manila envelope, so this definitely a step-up.Pros:~ The Envelope was great for storing my smaller (easily lost) major purchase and HSA receipts.~ The Secure File Folders were very helpful in storing assorted documents (W-2, 1099, ect.) This system limits the number of organizational tools you can add by the number of available slot which means you have to know exactly what you want from the get-go. I believe this is an organizational system for people who are already pretty well organized to the extent that you have to know how many tools and of what sort you need when you set out. Locking system works well for getting items in and out. I am disappointed in this pendaflex system though, as it doesn't seem to be all that useful. The system is, well, its own standard. I took this out since I don't need it.Overall this works much better for me than my old system of collecting various file folders and papers from my desktop at the end of the day. I was hoping the Pendaflex I.Organize system would pack a little more of a punch, considering the way it's described. There is nowhere in this system to keep a pad of paper in quick, easy reach. A new system to help you organize. This Pendaflex system attempts to allow you to organize your office materials.

I expected the whole system to be made a lot better.I would not use it for everyday tasks but it would come in handy if you have an interview and you need to tuck your resume away and have something to store all your paperwork that is needed for an interview.

I personally am not impressed and sadly would not recommend the system.

I purchased 4 more of these to make the system work for me.Envelope: a nice big plastic envelope, I use this to hold my company credit card receipts that I have to compile at the end of each month.
