The photo quality is great--as I have grown to expect from most Epson printers I have encountered--and I was happy to find out that it is a front-loading printer. Even with photo prints, this printer is awesome! You must use the photo paper tray that has all these settings and guides you must align. It is unbelievably convenient to be able to snap a photo with the iPhone and two clicks later have it printing on this printer.I found the other functions to be serviceable. The photo quality is especially impressive. I used a photo file that I printed with other similar competitive printers and also uploaded to Shutterfly (on-line printing company). I proceeded to scan in an entire photo album in order to make a backup of very old family photos. You can scan a photo, pull it off the computer, or best, just insert your camera's memory card(check online User's Guide for compatibility), some cards need an adapter. There is a second photo and CD label printing tray which really reduces the capacity of main paper tray. But ask it to print a photo and you'll spend an afternoon watching Epson photo paper shoot right through giving you error messages. I only tried the photo printing twice and to be honest wasn't all that impressed. A 30-sheet photo tray is integrated into the tray, and a rear feed can also be used. I will continue to use my Canon MP980 for photo printing from my PC and my Epson WF2540 for document printing and scanning.

That is important since many photo printers I have dealt with in the past distort the hues and the saturation levels wind up looking out of wack a lot.

The photo printing wasn't anything stellar though, colors just weren't as crisp as I'd want around edges of things in the photos.

I'd still prefer a dedicated photo printer if I was printing my own photos.I had no problems with any of my IOS devices as another reviewer did, so apparently your mileage may vary.The screen is very nice though, I had no issues whatsoever with touches registering what I wanted them to register.
