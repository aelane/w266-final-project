This tape is PERFECT! It holds, NO PROBLEM, so I am using much less tape. I'm now using this tape for all packaging needs for my eBay sales. That holds the tape in place so you can easily tear if off with the metal serrated edge.We will be moving soon so I compared it with a Scotch brand tape that was similar. I like this tape, and it is thicker and requires less than the 3M heavy duty I use. To be fair, I normally buy packing tape in packages of 6 or 8 rolls, so it's not fair to compare the per-roll price to this item, which is one roll.However, unless the price is radically different, I think that this isn't justified. Nice and strong tape. This tape is high quality stuff. But if your worried about tape not sticking or whatever then this stuff will put your mind at ease as it is very sticky and very thick. It's tape for crying out loud. This tape seems thicker and tackier than the typical cheap stuff we purchase and of high quality overall. This tape is very thick and tough, and the adhesive is strong. I've used the HDclear tape with great success before which made me a fan of Duck brand tapes. This tape works great. The tape works well enough and is strong enough for holding boxes for moving or packaging gifts. I always buy tape in bulk and don't tend to use dispensers. The tape is adequate and has good clarity.If you are someone who only uses packing tape on rare occasions, this product will work fine for you. If you use a-lot of tape and need to have a cost-effective solution, You should keep on looking. That means that the tape split as I was pulling it off the roll, making me pick at the strip still sticking to the roll and starting it over. But after what I've been through using this tape, I can't bring myself to buy it again. The tape is high quality, thick, is easy to unstick from itself.The plastic dispenser is a bit flimsy though.So, go with a larger tape gun if you are able. I use packing tape every day, and normally buy Scotch or even a store brand. I use less tape since it is so heavy duty. Before I tried this tape I had bought the 3M tape 4-pack on Amazon and this tape puts it to shame! This tape is much stickier and much thicker. And I don't know if the Scotch tape sold on Amazon is just old or what, but it barely sticks to anything, as many people have stated in the reviews. Although the tape stuck to itself like it was welded there, it absolutely would NOT stick to the cardboard shipping box. Had to wrap the tape around and around the package in all directions to assure that it would not come off during shipment and then, I still had my doubts.In desperation, I jumped onto the Amazon site and started looking for packing tape. Will use this tape for the rest of my life and never look back.Thanks Amazon and thanks Duck Brand tape. This tape is strong, durable and works fine. The tape does seem expensive than other comparable brands. It is a tough tape as you would expect coming from Duck Brand but you pay premium for the strength. If you don't need it then Scotch makes a comparable tape for far less.That's about all I can say about it. But sometimes using the tape without a dispenser is very time consuming. This tape is good quality tape and a fantastic price on Amazon. It is not too thin like some tape so it doesn't get twisted a lot. If the tape lays down on a shipping label by accident, just rub it in because it will not come off without destroying the label but that is the price you will pay for using premium tape. After you realize that you have to place it exactly as you want the tape and not fumble with it you will be overly happy with the tape. I judge packaging tape on three things. It's very strong tape, and held well from the start, without having to be pressed on a lot like some tapes. This tape started easily, which helps with frustration! This tape mostly didn't rip, but did once. Overall, good tape, but not perfect! I refuse to use cheap tape after being burned many times with it. Spend a little extra and get tape that actually holds up! so this tape is a keeper with others they would only last just over a month before i needed more. This tape met my expectations, but why the high price? This tape is worth it's weight in gold. I put some of this tape over & around my open lotion & other pump bottles to prevent leakage or spills- not one leak occurred, for the first time ever during a move to a new home. This is tough tape. I will never use any other tape to send things off in the mail, pack boxes up for a move or close products tight without spillage or leaking. I have paid more for 3M tape and not had as much luck as with the Duck brand. This tape sticks well.T
