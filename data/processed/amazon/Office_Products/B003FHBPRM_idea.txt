The idea of a Post-It dispenser for attaching to a laptop is very appealing. It's a nice idea to have a little pouch of post-it notes stuck to your laptop, if you're someone who uses their laptop a lot (and I am). Great idea! This is a simple idea -- for those who love to use Post-It notes and are used to having a dispenser on your desk, make them portable, too.It is pictured on the packaging with it fastened to a laptop. A great idea. Although I love the idea of this pop up laptop dispenser, I am not sure this is going to be as practical as I would like. While I very much like the idea, my laptop has a hard life, and I prefer using my super stickies because the flapping of sticky notes annoys me terribly. The idea of attaching a sticky-backed cardboard Post-it holder to my lovely laptop leaves me cold. Or to simply draw up an idea, you may find yourself needing for a piece of paper. I do like the idea behind the product. And while these are a unique idea, they are just not something I would ever use.My daughter, on the other hand, loves sticky notes and uses them all the time. This is a great idea. For me, this is an idea that works. This looks like a good idea, thePost-it(R) Pop-up Laptop Notes Dispenser, 3 x 3 Inch (LND-330-3PK), but it's not what I thought it was going to be. "Actually, that's not quite true- I love the idea: a little pad to stick on your laptop. And it's a great idea, and in fact when you're using your laptop it's fine- you've got a pad of Post-its on the top, ready for you to use. I thought the pop-up idea to keep with your laptop was a cute idea. But when I got it -- the idea is to attach it to the outside of your laptop top -- with a warning it might peal off paint when removed!!! The idea of having post it notes readily available and as an integral part of your workspace is a great idea. It was a nice idea but a little unnecessary. The Post-it Laptop Note Dispenser is a great idea, and it could have been a slam dunk. This are a great idea for post-its, the dispensers are sturdy plastic and can be stuck virtually anywhere, the dispensers are even thin enough that you can carry them in your pants front or back pocket without crowding your wallet, it can be placed in your wallet, although if you have a really tiny wallet, it can look awkward. This looked like a good idea, but ultimately is only slightly more convenient than having a stack of notes without the dispenser. What a wonderful idea and so handy! I have no idea why anyone would want a sticky note dispenser glued to their laptop.Finally, the dispensers are very small and it appears that they require small stacks of sticky notes. You've got a winning idea for your business, but nowhere to put it on paper. Good inovative idea and packaging. This is an interesting idea to keep post-it notes handy on the lid of your laptop, or on any other surface.

The idea of a a little post-it note holder is cute.

I think they are a great idea to put on a fridge, or on a desk hutch.

Okay, I understand the idea behind this.
