If the sticky were about a quarter inch from the bottom, the corners of the lightweight paper wouldn't curl too much, but you'd still be able to pull the not up with ease.As it is, it's flatter, but still curls up & gets mushed or folded (when you close a book, for instance).Alternately, if the paper were a bit heavier, the current positioning would probably do better.The adhesion is in the regular sticky notes range, not supersticky, so it's not good for repositioning much before it's shot. These Avery sticky notes do not curl up, but lay FLAT when you use them, which means you can really use the WHOLE note and see it all. Who knew the sticky not could be improved? This gives the sticky the chance to start curling, and then the stickiness of the sticky is not tactful enough to keep it from releasing and curling the rest of the way up. These Avery sticky notes have an extra strip of adhesive near the bottom of the note so that it lays flatter. The "Lay Flat" sticky notes have two lines of adhesive, which better secures it to whatever surface, however, the adhesive is at the top, but not all the way at the bottom, leaving about 5/8" to be brushed against. But as it is, these Avery sticky notes have adhesive across the top and bottom and keeps the pages relatively flat. So when I saw these new sticky notes with a double adhesive strip, I knew I had to try them out. With the additional sticky strip, this is not nearly as likely to occur. It's not.The second sticky can't be right at the bottom, or you wouldn't be able to peal the label off the pad, so they moved it up a little. A regular sticky and a glue stick would probably be a better solution.
