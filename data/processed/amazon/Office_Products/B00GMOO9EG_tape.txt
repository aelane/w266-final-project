The tape is the same, thin kind that I've used several times when moving stuff around and costs a couple of dollars. The tape needs a dispenser or something, but since whatever you would be packing would be small, it's not terrible. 1 tape, one marker.The products are EXCELLENT. There is no tape dispenser, which would have cost very little to include a simple one like what comes with 3M tape.The bubble wrap is a nice inclusion, but there isn't a whole lot of it. The tape felt cheap and thin. The tape needs to be on a dispenser since it's impossible to dispense without losing the end. It looks like the tape will fit my Scotch dispenser. (The tape and marker do a good job.) Once again, tape the bottom securely and test as you pack. The tape was the weakest part of the set. The tape is 55 yards long.

The tape is large enough roll to seal all these packages and more.

The tape is not on a cutting roll so you will need to supply scissors to cut it.Overall a good value if you want an all in one moving kit, just be sure to buy extra bubble wrap if you have breakables.

The tape was very thin, and I don't believe I'd trust it with any breakables.
