It's great that you don't have to have an IR receiver, and the memory is a clever touch, but it just doesn't convince me at that price.Conclusion: I'd wait and see if the price drops once it's been available for a while.Dave I took the receiver out and plugged it into my computer but the remote didn't work. The receiver flashes green when all's well, flashes yellow when battery's low.It's comfy shape and weight plus rubberized finish make it a fun little gadget that's a great idea. The receiver stores inside the unit and turns to unit off.5. Reinserting the USB receiver into the slot turns it off. The 2ghz receiver works well, I used it farther than the suggested 30 feet, at about 40+ the signal started to degrade a bit, but overall EXCELLENT!It also has a sturdy zippered carrier to protect your presenter.
