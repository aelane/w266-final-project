These are incredibly sticky too, not like typical sticky notes. I love Post-it notes but sometimes you need something that will really stick (but still give you the option to remove). These Post-it notes are the right size for labels and small notes to yourself, however, I wouldn't mind seeing larger notes. These notes are a bit thicker than "normal" post-it notes. I've been using the post-it notes since their inception, at least 20 years ago. They are large enough that you can also write notes on them. These little post-it notes differ from a regular post-it pad in that the whole label is sticky on the back except for a narrow border where you pull the note off of the pad. I find these little notes to be handy and useful, and I now keep a stash of them in my desk. I've loved Post-it notes since I first saw them. These notes have a super sticky backing, indeed, but in order to make it easier for people to peel up the top sheet, a little (maybe 2mm) edge is left unstickied. I like to reuse the sticky notes in my text books as I progress through the book and these allow me to do so. These stick notes are genius! Thirdly, the notes stick strongly to any surface, which I find a plus, because not all stick notes stick so effectively. I would think these stick notes would be even more ideal if the size were a little larger for other uses. I do love those super sticky notes but this goes one step better.
