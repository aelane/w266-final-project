It claims that it can staple 15 pages with Swingline S.F. I tried using it for 2, 5, 10 and 15 pages(it claims that it can handle up to 15 per staple) and each time it jammed up even two pages! It works fairly well with up to six pages, but beyond that it struggles. But it staples up to 15 pages, and will tack a bulletin board, and you won't be out a lot of cash when it mysteriously disappears from your desk as dozens seem to have done for me. Your pages are stapled. But, when you go to 8-10 pages it jams although it is supposed to do 15. I generally don't go more than 7 or 8 pages for anything I staple, and this chewed through that without any problems. If you ever need to staple 16 pages then this is not the stapler for you because it will not work. For 15 pages or fewer then it is a great stapler. It can handle maybe 20-30 pages comfortably. It easily staples through the 5 or six pages I have used it for.

I won't do more than 10 pages with it.

If I have more than 10 pages, I either use another stapler or use a thick paper clip instead.This is a nice a little stapler that I've used without compliant and without any breakage for 10 years.

I don't usually staple more than a few pages at one time and I don't want to keep a big old stapler in my desk so this one is just right for me.
