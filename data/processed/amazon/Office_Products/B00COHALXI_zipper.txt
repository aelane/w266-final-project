The outside zipper is tight and my 7 yr old has some problems with it, so we had to put a little bar soap on it to make it a bit easier to start the unzip. It's a good zipper than runs smooth.Inside there is a few pockets for storage as well.I like the look of his binder. My Mead zipper binder was evenly sized throughout, and fit into my bookbag with no problems.This one is not that zipper binder AT ALL. The zipper on the outside is certainly handy, but not big enough to hold more than a single key, without a key ring, and something else really thin.The inside doesn't have the hundreds of little compartments that my old binder had. Furthermore, the zipper on the outside doesn't close all the way shut. It is well made and the zipper in front was very handy to keep small items (calculator) from falling out. The main zipper held up well and the 3-ring binder portion did it's job in holding papers without the rings becoming damaged. There's also a zipper pocket on the front cover that a student could put a smallish calculator in. The zipper encloses everything and it appears very durable. The outside zipper one would be good for a couple of pens. As well, the zipper does not completely close the top of binder so anything that may get tossed in could fall out.All in all, I think it is a good unit and probably does not have much of a demand lifespan left as kids move to more digital with their books, assignments, and communications. Inside the front zipper pouch are two elastic pencil loops and a small flat pocket that could also hold pens or a notepad. The extra zipper pocket and pen/pencil holders right up front are handy.

I used to have one of these Mead zipper binders back when I was in school.
