Load several sheets and let it do it's job. It will shred perfect sheets 8 and half by 11 and nothing else. That one you can put in like 15 sheets. Tried different sized sheets and it immediatly jammed. The SWINGLINE Stack-and-Shred 60X Hands Free Shredder, 60 Sheet Capacity automatically shreds up to 60 sheets at a time stacked in the auto feed chamber and up to five sheets at a time fed through the manual slot. Instead of manually feeding multiple sheets of paper into a cutter, the Stack-and-Shred uses a storage tray that you stack sheets of paper onto. This is why you can't place sheets of paper in the tray that are folded more than once. It will feed the sheets one by one until the stack is gone.The rest of the shredder is a very conventional 5 sheet cross-cut shredder with 4 gallon wastebasket drawer. I was sick of hand-feeding sheets of paper into my old shredder, and so had high hopes for this heavier-duty Swingline model...and I haven't been disappointed. It also says it will do 60 sheets in a stack (that's a lot!) However to do 60 sheets of paper, as advertised, it needs them stacked neatly and you can't put different sized papers or crumpled, thin, invoices and such in the pile.This unit makes a nice gift especially for someone who has accumulated a lot of records and needs to purge them--and isn't comfortable with going to a public shredding event, where they show up with a truck for you to dump in your bag of discarded personal papers. I put about 20 sheets in there at a time. It cannot do laminated sheets, thick paper or crumpled up paper. 60x sheets shredded at a time sounds impressive. You can put 60 sheets in there and they will get shredded (providing the machine doesn't jam; more on that later), but not simultaneously.The auto feeder works awesome if you have flat, unfolded sheets of paper free of staples, tape, or thick envelopes. My 55 sheets were old bills and bank statements, with almost no wrinkles, but each had a couple creases. I did stapled sheets, some more sheets held in a paperclip and loose sheets all mixed in together, put it in the tray, shut it and let it run. It says to limit stapled sheets to 25 pages.It also has a slot for credit cards, which works fine (I did what anyone who buys a new shredder does: root around my wallet for something credit card-like which I don't need anymore...)I was going to make this a 4-star review because of the manual feed being awkward and the slow speed of shredding a large stack but the more I think about this one compared to the one we have at the office, the more I like this one. If you put in stapled sheets, when the bottom sheet gets grabbed the staple will drag all the other sheets in with it causing a jam.Just like every other shredder, shreds fall in the bin directly under the cutters, making a pile. I've fed it folded sheets, wrinkled sheets, torn sheets, small sheets, envelopes, legal sheets folded over and more with no problems. For folded up sheets, and awkward sized paper it has the standard opening on top to manually feed it paper. It holds quite a few sheets of paper at one time and hasn't jammed on me even once. If you feed in more than 15 sheets of paper at a time or feed in folded and crumpled papers, it will jam in between and stop working. It can shred just a few sheets manually, or a stack of papers automatically. I can stack about 69 sheets of paper and it starts to shred automatically when I close the lid.

First let me say that just because it can handle 80 sheets doesn't mean it can shred that many, at least not all at the same time, or anywhere near it.

(Double sheets without adding machine tapes stapled to them works fine as well)Let's talk about security levels.

It also shreds up to 25 sheets of manually fed paper -- and will shred credit cards but NOT CD's or DVD's.I LIKE the way it shreds -- not in long strips but in segments, for better security, IMHO.A paper liner accompanies the machine (more liners can be ordered)-- it fits well in the tray and still enables to user to see how full it gets.
