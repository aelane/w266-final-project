This is a great binder for two reasons:1) the sturdy, one-touch ring that doesn't break easily from being opened and closed or from having a ton of papers in the binder2) the no-toner transfer plastic view. This is exactly the same as the Wilson Jones 2-inch binder with D-rings, except for having round rings, so it hold a little less paper than the D-ring version. Overall a good solid binder. This is a big binder and the description plays up the &#34;extra durable hinge&#34;, but I think that is misleading. This is a nice large binder with round rings. Overall, it is a solid, sturdy binder sure to enhance organization for home, school or office. This binder seems fairly sturdy all around. This is a really good binder. I hate when you get a binder and the hinges are slightly misaligned or have gaps, and every time you try to move paper in the binder it snags, rips, etc. This particular binder has round rings.Overall, I'm very pleased! This binder is white, inside and out. Wilson Jones claims that this binder is durable and, from all appearances, this claim seems to be accurate. This is a sturdy binder for school or work projects. I have this exact binder in several other sizes and am most happy with them. This binder is nice. This binder can be customized by inserting designed paper into the front, back and spine sleeves on the outside or left just plain white. While I've only had this particular binder a short while, it is sturdy and the hinges are easy to open & close. It has huge rounded binder rings that can hold up to 525 sheets of paper. I like how easily the binder rings open on this one because it's much easier to open and a little bit quieter.My problem is not with the design of this binder but the condition that I received it in. When I received this binder it had bubbles underneath the plastic cover on the inside. However had I purchased this binder I would have been very disappointed and would have sent it back. This binder has a 5 year guarantee on it, which is nice to know the manufacturer stands behind it (albeit wether it makes it to 5 years or not is a different story). Thus I would recommend it for uses where you need a binder that is both sturdy and that you will be opening and closing often. Great binder. It is an ordinary white binder with clear cover back and spine  for Insertion of your customized pages. This is a no-frills round-ring binder for office and school use. The binder feels solid, actually a bit on the hefty side compared to my Office Max store-brand 2-inch binders. I am a binder addict. So this binder has perforations all down the hinge. The binder can then be easily closed by pressing together only one of the round rings. The binder can hold over five-hundred sheets of notebook paper. The binder is easily customized by visiting the wilsonjones.com website and performing a search for product W87908PP3. It's odd to review a binder but this binder is thick so it should lead up to it's Extra durable hinges. The binder has traditional circle rings inside (as opposed to &#34;D-shaped&#34; rings). What can one say about a binder...not a whole lot it seems, but the binder is completely white with clear pockets in the inside, the outside pouches are also clear and easy to place paper/photos/etc. Basically a good binder option for presentation materials that need a customized binder cover and spines. This is a standard round-ring binder of good quality. As it happens, I needed to get a new binder to hold some student data. This is the standard binder that you've probably used a version of at some point. My Wilson Jones Ultra Duty Round Ring binder is a good binder. I replaced an aging Avery binder with this one and am very happy. I have a binder for my recipes, so it's filled with the plastic pocket sheets which can be pretty heavy. Opening this binder was much easier than my old one, but still closes securely.The inside also has many pockets which I find quite handy. Overall, this is a great binder. I wanted a sleek, clean, good-looking, sturdy white binder to hold the documents for a big project I&#8217;m working on. This binder is not great quality. I am disappointed in this binder. The binder appears to be very sturdy and love the fact that the three rings are attached to the back of the binder than the spine. This is a nice binder with outside pockets to put either a photo or somekind of paper in to identify the folders usage easily. I wouldn't bet on that but this binder does seem to be a bit better quality than many others out there on the market. Time will tell but I'd be surprised if these lasted much longer than any other binder out there. My binder came with some bubbles under the surface that aren't the end of the world (they're on the inside) but for an "Ultra Duty" binder with these claims you'd think they'd be in perfect condition.Overall I think this binder has some great features and I would recommend it. For them, I have found that a flexible binder in general will make it farther though the school year. Overall, I prefer a binder of this width with the D-ring closure because the pages are easier to turn on a D-ring once you get up to the larger widths including 1 1/2" and up. However, the comparable Wilson Jones binder with a D-ring requires two hands to open and is a bit stiff, so if you have arthritis or are buying this for a young student, this is a preferable binder. The Wilson Jones Ultra Duty Round Ring View Binder with Extra Durable Hinge, 2-Inch, is a sturdy binder with customizable front, back, and spine to personalize it for your own use or for business purposes. When open, the binder lies flat making reviewing documents or taking notes easier. This is a larger plastic 3 ring binder.
