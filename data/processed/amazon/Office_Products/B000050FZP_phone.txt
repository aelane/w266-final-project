This AT&T; white is more of an off-white, not the Polar white of GE/RCA white phone accessories, nor anyone else's ivory, ash, or beige that I can determine. But if you want only one "main" corded phone for the living room, kitchen or office, there are plenty more choices out there. I imagine it is a wonderful phone if you get one that works. finally a phone that you don't need to plug into an electrical outlet, no power supply needed, just a phone jack.It's just right, for $12, it's a steal. This is why ANY phone will do. The AT&T; phone is exactly what you should buy. It's a good old phone. Best corded phone on the market -- voice quality, lighted keypad, small footprint. This phone started to have problems around the 1yr mark. The AT&T; Trimeline is a very basic corded phone that works when the power goes out. Excellent simple old fashioned wired phone. We needed a corded phone to use during winter power outages here in rural northern Vermont. If you buy this phone, you should too.All in all, it's a very, very good phone. This is a very nice phone for the price and I have no complaints. I've been using the Trimline phone since it was called the Princess Phone back in the Ma Bell days. It still can be used if you main phone broke and you need temporarily to use something else until you purchase a better phone. it is a good phone and it has a good sound to it. A hard wired phone (as opposed to a cordless) should sound great but clearly these phones don't! If you're looking for a very basic phone that is of high quality and durability, this is the phone for you! As I said though, this phone is the basic... no caller ID, etc., no bells and whistles... just a phone with great sound clarity that seems like it will last me as long as I need to use it. The phone itself even looks nice. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who needs a basic communication device and who still believes in the AT&T name. Although this phone is clearly not the same as the real Bell trimline phones, it still has the great, comfortable design and the dialpad in the handset, which makes it an excellent choice. I'm guessing (could be wrong here) that this phone will be around forever, even though AT&T; no longer promotes it on their web-site. I recently bought this phone after several two more expensive models failed; his telephone by AT&T; and Lucent works better than the other phones I bought when I had to get a new phone for my home. Yes, it is corded; but when all you really need is a basic phone this really does the job. The phone offers well known features including "last number redial," too. The phone has a mute feature, adjustable ringer volume and more. I am particularly impressed that a phone in this price range even has a twelve number memory feature for speed dialing. The phone takes up little space and it can even be wall mounted to completely save counter space in a kitchen or any other room. We just replaced an older AT&T 210 corded phone with a new one because the sound on the old one had become difficult to hear. We use the phone as a kitchen wall phone. This phone is competitively priced and fulfills our needs so we can recommend it without reservation. A classic, well made phone like they all used to be. We like to keep one non-electric phone in the house in case power goes out. This is fine little phone and the price as great. I use this phone for a buck up in case the electricity fails and my cordless phones do not work. The AT&T; Trimline 210 corded phone certainly isn't encumbered with a lot of bells and whistles, but it has enough extras to suit my purpose.We have a 35-year-old home we built.T
