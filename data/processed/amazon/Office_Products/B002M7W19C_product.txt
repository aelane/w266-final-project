Other than that, it's a pretty cool product. You can't mass product tab labels and then stick them on. I tried the product in various settings and found that the adhesive didn't stick properly to many surfaces and I'd find the pocket having slipped out of it's holder. The product description is quite accurate, and it's simply a very nice idea. Brilliant product! I recently got these as an Amazon Vine product for review and I really should have read the reviews on the product first. Nice product. Avery PocketTabsare, unfortunately, a flawed product. This is the second Avery PocketTabs product that I have tried and I love this idea and the products! This product is oriented for CD-ROM storage. They're a great new product and one I highly recommend. I really like this product and will definitely buy more to put in my journals and notebooks. This is a new product that is a fantastic idea for storing cd's in any type of book or folder! They are see through.Great 5/5 product. This is a great product for CD's, DVD's, Business cards, photos if you want to carry them around in your purse or a notebook. I highly recommend this product. I did not know that I needed this product, but now I can't live without it! Overall, a good product with tons of uses.

I obtainted this product via the Vine Program (sample product is supplied to Vine members at no cost for evaluation)as I thought it would provide a nice storage sleeve for either a CD/DVD or similar flat items.

It appears that this product was originally designed for a special purpose that was either scrapped or failed and that the company is looking for some way of salvaging their investments in parts.If you are looking for a CD/DVD sleeve, buy one made specifically for that purpose.

Trying to force this product to do any of those jobs is just a waste of time and money.
