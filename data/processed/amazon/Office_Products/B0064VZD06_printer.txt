The printer accepts paper sizes ranging from 4X6 to 13X19 inches. To keep the printer heads moist, I routinely print a test page at all my printers weekly. With the Canon printer I decided to take a short course in photography and printing and I've just spent two weeks in that pursuit.The Canon Pixma Pro 1 is a heavy, oversized printer- not one to fit neatly under most living room computer desks and I've placed mine on a very sturdy, large coffee table. The printer accommodates paper sizes ranging from 4X6 to 13X 19. This printer uses up a considerable amount of ink in the initial priming process and the ink indicator light alerts you to ink levels. It is not a fast printer and takes it time to generate truly professional quality prints.The quality of the pictures out of this machine can only be described as gorgeous and museum quality. That printer is quite good, but this one blows it away. Yes, the printer is expensive, too expensive for most people's daily work. I haven't used the printer hardly at all since my last update, turned it on and it went through another 'prime' cycle. Basically, the printer ate up over $150 of ink just sitting there looking pretty. There isn't much more I can say about this printer that hasn't already been said by other reviewers. This printer does indeed produce photo quality prints up to 13x9 in. This is a printer for the serious photographer. The printer was easy to set up and use. I was then offered this printer, the Canon PIXMA PRO-1 Professional Inkjet Printer, to review and I thought it would be great to compare them side by side. This printer does give you the option to hook it up to your network but only by using a cable. I wondered how this printer would compare with the Epson printers I have owned.On the plus side, the quality of printed photographs is totally amazing. Indeed, this printer has far more capability than I will likely ever use. If you are going to acquire this printer, have a big place to put the printer.This printer is also heavy. The printer is certainly an amazing piece of equipment for someone who takes their photography seriously. This printer is wonderful.. If you are looking for a great printer this one is for you. The printer prints things very clear and the contrast is wonderful. I highly recommend this printer if you are looking for some professional type things to print... I assume that if you are looking at this printer, you are a professional photographer who wants beautiful, large prints with great shade variation and color depth. If so, this printer, with its 12 ink cartridges and many shades of gray, black and white among others, is for you. The Canon PIXMA PRO-1 printer produces AMAZING quality photo prints. When this printer arrived we were excited to start catching up!We now have frame worthy wedding photo's, and my son-in-laws restored 1936 Dodge truck among other treasures.The printer is very large 27.4" X 18" and 9 1/2" tall, plus extra room is needed for paper to enter and exit the printer ~in front 14" and behind, 10" for work space.It's an awkward 60 + lb to move, and really needs an area dedicated for the printers home.The only way this printer can be used is to be hooked up to a computer, (P.C./Laptop)and install the software onto that computer ~ it doesn't have a screen of it's own.It doesn't have any slots for memory cards (no 'SD') and it doesn't have scanning capabilities.And for folks who may have an older computer, you may want to know that the printer requires a high speed USB port.We don't have an SLR camera yet, so I loaded the pictures on my SD card from my Fuji digital camera,to my laptop, and I must say ~ the results are very impressive.I compared three copies of the same photo ~1. This is the printer I wanted to get when I bought my PIXMA Pro 9000 Mk II. Fortunately this printer fits on the table. The printer shows you how much ink you have so you can order new ink and avoid running out. This printer is an amazing piece of kit. I haven't used them on this printer, as I've only had it a week or so, but past experience with them has left me appreciating their support.Worth the money for those with the need.UPDATE Nov 5, 2012- I am now at a point that I have to start buying ink tanks for this printer. Canon went all out with this 61# printer! This printer is for professionals. The printer itself however is enormous and takes up a lot of space. This printer is overkill and much too expensive for regular people. So as amazing as this printer is, it can be very pricy to operate if printing photographs and selling them is not your business.The printer is huge (27" x 9.5" x 18.5" and weighs about 75 pounds) and requires a table to set it on. This printer is absolutely amazing, and would be essential for either the professional photographer or the amateur that wants great pictures.I
