It's very easy to use, very easy to replace the roll of tape, very convenient, and I don't have that problem with the tape getting all messed up between uses. It comes with one roll of tape already loaded up. You cannot put a large roll inside as it simply will not fit. Pulling back on the roll is a snap, cutting the tape is not so easy. Easy to change the roll and start the roll. A roll this size will probably last us for up to a year. You must use a small roll, not the larger rolls that are more often used (and available) for standard dispensers. I suppose they opted for a smaller sized roll so that the dispenser wouldn't be too top heavy or unwieldy, but I still wish they had used full sized tape, so I'm taking off a star for that. It also is much smaller than the standard roll of packing tape, 900 inches (25 yards) vs 54 yards.If you use packing tape only occasionally, then this product will probably work for you. The roll of tape is quite small as well, so if you are planning on using this a lot you may need something that can hold a larger sized roll.Now I have seen other reviewers having issues with finding the tape replacements, just for the fun of it (as my tape dispenser is actually new and don't need a replacement right now) I searched for the tape replacements in several stores online and was unable to fin any! Scotch Easy-Grip Tape Dispenser DP-1000 comes with one roll of tape, which is a little smaller than the standard size sealing tape, but you can find this size, especially if you search online.

This also means finding a new roll is more difficult, due to it not being a standard size in retail.I did not like how the plastic seemed to have a fragile feel to it.

When using just a roll of tape, it is just as easy to protect it by folding over the last little bit and cutting it off when you use it next.

It uses a proprietary sized roll of tape, so you can't refill it with value-priced tape refills.3.
