The dispenser is easy to use. The dispenser is re-useable, just buy a replacement roll and you're good to go. The dispenser can be used with either strength tape. And, because the dispenser is refillable, I imagine that refills are sold so that if you prefer a different type of dispenser, you should be able to buy the tape alone. Be careful when you lift it up and roll it on the dispenser, or else it will tear almost as easily as traditional packing tape. This easy to use dispenser is refillable and keeps the tape from sticking to itself. The dispenser that comes with this is definitely not intended for repetitive or constant use. With the ST-181 dispenser I can tape up a box in about ten seconds, with this it's about three times as long. It cuts clean when you are ready to use the dispenser's strip cutter. The dispenser is okay too, and definitely beats a loose roll of tape and a pair of scissors. The dispenser works well; you just pull the tape out to whatever length you want and rip. The dispenser was easy to use and the tape did not roll back onto itself. It doesn't roll back because of the handy dispenser. The dispenser is not really heavy duty in line with the tape and perhaps if it was a bit tougher it would dispense a little easier. I got to where I was very efficient with it but I think I would have done much better with this little dispenser. Using the dispenser actually slowed me down, but I think most people would find it useful.I'm thinking it might end up being worthwhile to pay more for this tape, use a lot less, and get a more secure package. The dispenser works great for taping boxes and sealing things up. That said, what do you expect for a free dispenser that comes with a $10 roll of tape? Although this dispenser if refillable, if you plan to seal a lot of boxes you might want to spend a few more dollars and buy a tape gun.

), the dispenser might clearly have been constructed by child slave labor in China, Mexico, Ethiopia?The outside, top label I received differs from the one pictured upon this product page.

This dispenser can be refilled, and a new roll would easily be put into this holder (it was easy for me to remove the full roll, and easy for me to put it back into the dispenser).
