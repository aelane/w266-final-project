When you get down to less than 5 or so staples, the integrity of the stapler starts to fail. Usually, I'd think maybe I needed to buy better Swingline staples for the Swingline stapler, but in this case, I don't see that it's going to matter. It doesn't hold that many staples, but at least it is light. I also wish it came with some staples. It has no staples that come with it. You must purchase staples separately.3. It takes standard staples. And it's easy to open and add more staples. I did find it interesting that it didn't come with a few staples to get started as every other stapler I've ever bought does. And I was disappointed that it didn't come with any staples. The staples went in easily, and stapling with it was absurdly easy! It does not come with any staples, so be sure and order some (standard size). It comes without staples, so you'll have to buy those separately and right away. It takes standard staples and the green is a nice, soothing color.

This makes it too easy to end up spilling out my staples or just having them get dislodged inside the stapler.In other words, this is a cute stapler for use on a student desk.

It doesn't come with staples, and it won't fit an entire batch of staples.

I put staples I had at home in and it immediately jammed.
