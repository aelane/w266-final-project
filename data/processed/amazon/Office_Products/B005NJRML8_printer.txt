This is not the best printer in the world by any means, but it has some nice assets for those on a budget. If you want a printer for photos, fancy greeting cards, special media like disc lables, to transcribe t-shirt iron-ons, or to serve as your copy machine, this is not the droid you're looking for, so search elsewhere. Since we could use a second printer anyway, I got this one.As a printer, it's just fine. I like on my Brother printer that when set up and ready to print, all the moving pieces are "tucked in". To use this printer, you need to download an app from Samsung and print from there. I would not recommend this printer. I recommend this printer for homes and small offices. The Samsung ML-2955DW is a wireless black and white printer, with a duplex option.The print quality is crisp and good.I had problems duplex printing a thick paper, even when I had the printer set to thick paper. All I had to do though was plug printer into outlet, plug a USB cord from the printer to my computer, and run the install CD that included network setup. It would be overwhelmed as a shared printer for an office of more than 5. I also have a Brother printer and they are very comparable in their cost and functionality. WPSSince the printer has a WPS button and my router has WPS setup, decided to give this a try. Had to download the printer driver (34.51 MB as EXE file) to the computer, install the program, then go thru printer setup. NoiseThis printer is quiet in standby mode. This printer was easy to setup using the supplied software and USB cable to connect it to my laptop. The printer is quiet. But I digress.Back to this printer review.Setup is easy. The printer comes with a setup CD, which is great, buy my laptop has no CD drive. This printer prints *very* quickly.
