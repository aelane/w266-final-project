This is the second 3M monitor arm I've used, and I'm mounting a second 24 inch monitor on it, this one with a touchscreen. Depending on your monitor and your eyesight and if applicable the glasses that you wear this can present a challenge if you need to have a lot of desk space available to park your work on. Would be nice to be able to just push the monitor higher or lower from your chair. This is a very straightforward monitor arm to put together. It is supporting my 30" monitor just fine and it allows for a good bit of tilt adjustment owning to its solid ball head. Mounting the monitor is fairly easy, but I have found that for the power, DVI, VGA and HDMI cables I needed to hook up to my monitor the cable routing channel in the arms was a bit undersized. For a 7.4-pound monitor arm, this is strong. This makes it very easy to maneuver my 22-inch monitor. I am using this with with a 28-inch monitor weighing 17 pounds (7.5 kg). I reviewed it on 2011-March-01 (link below) and am still very happily using on my secondary monitor (which does get repositioned frequently).----Stability: The desk mount base is larger than that of many competing products and this provides excellent gripping power on the desk and stability even at the full extensions of the arm. Without this, I have to hold the monitor in one hand and start the screws with my fingers and then pick up a screwdriver to finish tightening. I really like this monitor arm except for one thing. The 3M MA140MB is a VESA MIS-D compliant dual-swivel monitor arm. Which means that your monitor must also be VESA MIS-D compliant or the mounting holes on the bracket will not line up correctly on your monitor. With both monitor arms, however, you need a lot of slack or else you'll end up putting a lot of stress on your monitor's connectors when you move your monitor around. It's also competitively priced with many of the entry-level monitor arms on Amazon and comes with a three year warranty. I have been happily using a 3M MA200MB monitor arm in my office for over a year and so I am really glad to review this 3M MA140MB dual-swivel monitor arm for the Vine program. The monitor mount also allows tilting, which increases the versatility. Overall, I have to agree that this is a high-quality dual-swivel monitor arm. I often use my monitor in portrait mode when reading spreadsheets so this is so easy to adjust. This monitor arm is exactly what I needed. It's amazing.My monitor arm arrived without assembly instructions except for the exploded pictures on the stickers closing the boxes it arrived in. Having used several monitor display arms over the years, I easily place this one at the top of them all.The MA140MB may be more expensive, but in this case, you definitely get what you pay for....AND this one is worth it!PROSEasy to set upSturdy (less expensive ones wobble)Excellent protective packagingMore creative/flexible positioning optionsCONSInstructions could be more clear, but still simple to put togetherI highly recommend! The monitor arm is well constructed of solid weighty metal. The monitor bracket fastens to the back of the monitor with knurled thumbs screws and hold the monitor very securely. His heavy 32" monitor is easily held in place a good 7" off of his desk and can rotate between portrait and landscape positions and tilts to a far more agreeable angle than the base stand that came with it.This is another quality product from 3M. Orienting the monitor vertically is great when working on documents while displaying the entire page. The monitor is heavier than more modern LED backlit monitors and the weight is not a problem for the device. This is slightly more convenient because the monitor can be quickly moved out of the way and more easily turned for viewing by someone sitting across from my desk. Being able to easily move the monitor so a coworker can view it has been more useful than I expected and is great for working on projects as a team.When I requested this item through the vine program I actually imagined using it in my bedroom at home. I wanted to mount a monitor to my headboard and connect it to an Apple TV so I could lie on my back and watch movies, but push it to the side when not in use. While the monitor can be rotated 360 degrees and viewed in vertical orientation, it cannot be rotated in the way I imagined for use in my bedroom (actually pointing the monitor downward toward the floor). With this monitor, all of these issues have been resolved.Aside from a general well-rounded construction, this mount provides many benefits. I have a 24" LCD monitor (Asus VS247H-P 24-Inch Full-HD LED-Lit Monitor) hung on this 3M monitor arm. The monitor mount attaches to the rear of my desk and can be adjusted to nearly any viewing angle. The monitor is mounted on the far edge of my desk which gives me more than double the tabletop surface to spread out my papers and work. I have another monitor arm for a different computer that can be adjusted up and down and it's a great feature, but I know that's not what this model was designed to accomplish.Anyway, for what it's supposed to do, this product is outstanding in all areas except for the instruction sheet. The 3M was easier to attach to the monitor because you only have to attach the small piece before the first swivel (With the Ergotron, you have to attach one of the two arms to the monitor). BUT, I usually only install a monitor on an arm once, so it's hard to give 3M a higher rating for an easier time with the one-time install...Other than looks, the big area where the 3M system loses is vertical movement. If you have a bigger heavier monitor, this makes the 3M attractive again! So if you have a heavy monitor or TV monitor, this could be the mount for you!Then there's a final area that Ergotron wins. That's when I saw this swivel monitor arm and told him to quit looking for a shelf. This works perfectly for us and now the very large monitor is raised to a height that makes the tall guy happy and the space on the desk is free for all his "stuff". Attaching the monitor was also very easy using the provided thumb screws. I am now using 2 monitor arms on my desk. The monitor does have the ability for height adjustments, by moving it up and down a poll. And a smaller monitor on the LX Desk Mount which does have height adjustment on the go.Overall... great product. This is a very capable monitor arm (this will be my third, which should tell you something). This monitor arm is very well made, it's built like a tank, I love it.W
