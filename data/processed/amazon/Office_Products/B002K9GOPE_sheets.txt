They are thin sheets that didn't get stuck in my Canon printer. These are 25 sheets of white self-adhesive paper labels, 30 of which are present on each sheet, meant for use as shipping address labels. I use Microsoft Word to print entire sheets of addresses. I have recently printed a few sheets of these labels off my HP LaserJet 4100 and they all worked almost perfectly. I prefer these sheets to the Avery sheets for this reason.The color was a nice bright white, the adhesive is great, and it worked with my labels I had saved on the computer in an Avery format. I ran a few sheets of these through my laser printer and they came out looking great! There are 25 sheets, with 30 labels per sheet. Of the several sheets I printed, I have found them to perform as well, or in some cases, even better than my usual store brand labels which are what I happen to have lying around at the moment. With these 3M sheets, you can print outlabels yourself, as you need them, thus eliminating the problem of leftoversthat you can't use once you relocate. With the 3M sheets, you're still not spendinga fortune, and high quality is assured. These label sheets are standard size and will work with both top feed and bottom feed printers.
