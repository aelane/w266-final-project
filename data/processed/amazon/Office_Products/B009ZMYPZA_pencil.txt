I have been homeschooling since 1994 and I wish I would have invested in an automatic pencil sharpener years ago. And perhaps most importantly, it should prevent you from over-sharpening or shaving the whole pencil down to a useless nub. This electric pencil sharpner can automatically sense your pencil when inserted and sharpens the pencil well. This is my third electric pencil sharpener in a year and the best by far. After buying several different pencil sharpeners and trying a few that I received from the Amazon Vine program, I am prepared to make a blanket statement regarding pencil sharpeners: they don't make them like they used to. I already had a pencil sharpener but was really happy to get this one. My old electric pencil sharpener stopped working after a short period of time of light use. This electric pencil sharpener arrived two days ago, and I've sharpened every pencil in the house. You also have to grip the pencil being sharpened pretty tightly so it doesn't spin in the sharpener.After sharpening about 50 pencils, it started squeaking slightly when you remove the pencil and the motor is stopping.It makes teeny tiny little shavings that are obnoxious to clean up and have a tendency to "stick" to the end of the pencil, so you are constantly dealing with lead dust on the pencil end. If you use a pencil sharpener a lot, this one won't make you very happy.Edited! It is MUCH quieter than our previous Corporate Express pencil sharpener. It stops when the pencil is sharp, and I don't have to jam it in very hard to get it to sense the pencil and begin sharpening. This is a pretty good little pencil sharpener for occasional use. Some pencil sharpeners don't take these colored pencils well.

I fully admit that I'm a pencil sharpener snob.

However, because the pencil goes in at a 40-degree angle from the horizon, it does not slide.

This pencil sharpener isn't impressive or fancy.
