The Canon Laser printer does it all. I just received my Canon Laser printer and it took one afternoon to set it up. The Laser printer prints two sided documents without me having to take the document off the printer, turning it over and placing the document back on the printer. It is a great printer and I would recommend it  to anyone who needs a printer. Compared to a similar sized Samsung laser printer box, Samsung chose to go with the less user friendly handhold-free box.Opening the box reveals, sitting right on top, clear instructions on how to safely take your investment of money out and how to set it up. Very impressed with this printer. UPDATE 6/2014:  I still love this printer. I received this printer in November 2012, and it has performed flawlessly. I bought this printer to do fairly heavy printing at our small office. This printer does not disappoint. The printer itself has a fairly small footprint. The printer is quiet and has an energy saving feature to help with energy costs. This printer also works as a copier. If you don't change it, the printer will refuse to even attempt to print so you can't tell that you still have a relatively full ink cartridge. I would like a printer that doesn't force you to buy more ink than you really need. I am glad to have this printer, it is user friendly and takes up little room on my counter. I do have to report that the printer needs to be placed in scan mode by directly pressing a button on the printer and then move to the computer to scan. Terrific printer. This printer set up within 5 minutes and we had no issues connecting the wireless functions to our computers. !This printer is also incredibly quiet!
