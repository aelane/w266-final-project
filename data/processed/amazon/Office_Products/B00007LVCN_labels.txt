But, I would much prefer one of these labels to a name badge at a conference. The labels  can be removed form the backing very easily. I have to admit I'm really surprised these labels didn't jam in my printer. So, hearing that these labels had a better adhesive, I decided a test was in order. Avery labels are easily printed in Word. I needed some "Hello" labels for a non-profit function and chose these. I have found all Avery labels to be typically easy to load and use, and these were no exception to that rule. These labels can be separated with the backing left in tact for later adhesion, so they can be sorted alphabetically if needed. These labels are the best I have found. Will be using these labels for a family reunion. Great labels!

The Avery 8395 labels -- generically called name badges -- are outstanding in both features and price.

Plain all-white labels easily peel off the main sheet of 8 labels each and onto wherever you want "labeled".If you use them for name badges, you can remove the badge/label with the backing attached by turning the sheet over (easy!)

I primarily use these labels for convention games because it helps get everyone in the proper state of mind.People wear all types of clothing so I need labels that won't damage them.
