And I really like fountain pens. Still afraid to keep any fountain pen in my shirt pocket from previous experience with a fountain pen...perhaps I'll get over that.If you love trying out different pens, or like to have people comment on your writing utensil, grab yourself a pack and have a ball...or nib as it were! This is a great little fountain pen ~ the quality surprised me since it is disposable. I love fountain pens and have some really great ones. I've written with fountain pens for over half a century. I looked for these fountain pens for years, and finally found them on amazon. I wanted fountain pens to write, and these are very nice set of pens. Love these disposable fountain pens. These are real fountain pens in a collection of many colors. I've been exploring inexpensive fountain pens and decided to try this multi-colored Pilot Varsity set. If you've ever considered using a fountain pen (no fatigue, effortless writing) or if you've tried a fountain pen and thought it was too much of a hassle--get a set of these.I much prefer to write with fountain pens over anything else. I enjoyed writing with fountain pens when I was a schoolgirl decades ago and over the years I had traded in the fountain pens for the ease and convenience of ballpoint pens. When I saw these disposable fountain pens by Pilot, I decided to give them a try since they were reasonably-priced compared to some of the expensive fountain pens out there.I am so happy with the results. These disposable fountain pens are a dream to write with  as they glide on  paper smoothly with consistent ink flow.
