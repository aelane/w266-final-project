They adhere amazingly well and have far more adhesive than a typical sticky note. Once the note has been placed, either leave the flap on for easy removal or take it off for a truly border-less stick!While these are labeled as super sticky, I'm not sure I would agree with this. They are certainly more sticky than a traditional Post-It note both in increased stick area and stronger adhesive, but they are far from being "super sticky". These are more expensive than the regular note pads so I save these for important notes that I don't want to get lost. They adhere much better than a regular post-it note. These are great when you want your note to stick all the way down. It's not like it's some Post-It note with 2Gb of memory into it. It's a Post-It note. I always wondered why 3M didn't make Post-it note paper with adhesive ALL OVER the back instead of just a strip. When the average sticky note has fallen off in high humidity areas...these super stickies hang in there. It's basically one large post-it note. Will have to see what happens after the note is left for a couple of weeks to see if the adhesive gets difficult to remove over time. I was thinking about writing a note to myself to buy cat food and then stick it on my cat, but I changed my mind. They come in two typical post-it note fashion colors of lime green or hot pink fuschia that will stand out where ever they are placed and re-placed. These stick really well and come off easily when I wanted to remove the note.

A typical post-it note has the slightly sticky adhesive on about 25% of it's back.

You can use these "Super Sticky" notes just like any other note.

Much like a sticky note, but instead of just one strip of sticky on the top of the note, the complete back of the label is sticky.
