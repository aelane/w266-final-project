These pens are totally passable pens. The pens work well, but this multi-color pens come with a number of colors I just can't use day to day (green?) I use mostly black pens, but I do use the other colors as well. I first discovered Pilot pens in the mid-1970's when they introducedthese pensas an alternative to the standard Bic pen. And these pens are made in the USA. I love that these pens are made from recycled material. I like these pens, they've done a good job of making them easy to write with but also with a hint of the water bottle design in them. Quite favorably impressed by these pens. The pens are lightweight, very comfortable, great flow and nice ink color. They've quickly become my favorite pens in my home office. I absolutely will buy these pens again - as long as Pilot can keep the cost reasonable - and will continue to look for more products made from recycled materials and made in the U.S.A.  Yay for Pilot! These Pilot Bottle to Pen pens are currently way up at the top of my list of favorites. I have been using these pens since they came out in the blue and black. Great pens for the price. They're retractable pens so you don't have to worry about misplacing the caps. Also, these pens are refillable! I highly recommend these pens! They have qucikly become my favorite pens to write with at work. Love these pens! The pens write very well (smoothly), are comfortable to hold, and worked well right out of the package. It's recycled so that is great, the pens last a long time and really good to write with.
