Wow, I cannot believe it is not easier than this to connect this printer to my wi fi! The printer just cannot find my very fast and consistently working wi fi and I cannot tell you why. The compact printer did just fine for my needs. The printer did a good job. This printer takes 2 ink tanks instead of the multiple single tanks, which is fine with me I have had both types and the single tanks end up being more expensive it seems. I can not think of a all-in-one printer that is better in this price point. This is strictly a WiFi printer. I had an Epson WiFi printer about a year ago and the connection between my remote devices kept dropping out. The Pixma MX532 is a great Wireless Print Copy Scan Fax Cloud Link printer (Try saying THAT fast! The printer is stylish and is easy to operate. Honestly I didn't need to check the manual to operate of this printer - and I mostly use Epson printers. The Brother printer is as of this writing about $15 more expensive than the Canon. Basic black gives the printer a serious enough look for a workplace but does show a fair amount of dust. They are still loaded directly on the printer carriage but Canon has arranged the printer so that these can be loaded by opening the front panel rather than the 'traditional' propping open the entire top of the printer. Conversely, the Brother printer has a separate panel that swings open where the cartridges can easily be swapped in and out. I am not enamored of having the printer open at all times, as stray items can also fall into the paper path as can dust etc. The printer really wants to connect to an access point rather than your existing wireless network. The printer is Google ready, but to hook up with Cloud Print it prints out a URL and a scan barcode. )The printer seemed to be natively recognized by OS X, but the scanner needed a downloaded driver. Neither printer is a true photographic printer and the Canon MFC 6120--a higher end multifunction printer--does a better job than either of these.SCAN QUALITYI didn't notice any differences in scan quality between this Canon and the Brother printer. As my printer was in my home and not aggressively used, the printhead lasted somewhat longer.I get the fact that the printhead can go bad over time and that parts do wear out. My previous Canon printer, the MX310, was replaced by the MG 6120 because I wanted a networked printer and an upgrade. The printer is a bit of a bear to set up, but sadly this is par for the course with printers these days. I give this printer 4 stars for functionality and ease of use but take 1 star off for price. This printer leaves a very LARGE foot print, so you better have plenty of room for it. The printer does what it is supposed to do, it prints, scans, faxes, and copies, but of all the printers available now, this would not be my first choice. This is a good solid printer that prints well, faxes and scans. SETUPAlthough the printer doesn't come with a printed manual, it links you to the online manual. Other than this, printer setup is easy and fast.CONNECTING TO DEVICESThe printer comes with a CD and URL for setting up the printer on computers and devices. I needed a printer and wanted a wireless printer so I got this one and I am very happy with it. If you need a printer at home, it is just practical to get one that can do everything. This is also the quietest printer I ever had.ADF:The automatic feeder is a big plus compared to older printers. Turning off and turning on the printer solves the problem.Airprint:My Macbook Air and IOS devices immediately found the printer. When comparing this printer to the other top sellers on Amazon, you quickly notice that there is no color screen. For this printer, you have to hit a special Tone (asterisk) button to switch from between letters and numbers. I like this printer a lot. The printer has a small status screen to let you know what's going on.A very useful feature of this particular model is the top feeder. With my old Canon Pixma printer, though it was nice and reliable, I had to manually place each sheet to scan it.One downside is that my regular generic brand of ink cartridge (Sophia Global), at least as of this writing, doesn't appear to have cartridge size to fit this printer, so ink might cost more if I can't find a way to replace the ink cartridges other than buying the manufacturer's brand. My Epson printer has three different color cartridges so you have a bit longer lasting time frame because with the Canon, you might use up one color a bit quicker and your done.O
