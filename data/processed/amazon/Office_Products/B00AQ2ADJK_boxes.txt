For sealing packing boxes this is an excellent tape. I like it for heavy boxes that I am afraid will come open in the mail. But if you are going to put your boxes through rigors of air plane conveyor belt and other torture tests, this is the tape for you. I've never had USPS / UPS / FedEx opening my boxes during shipment to steal items out of them, so the extra "security" of this tape seems unnecessary. I especially like it in constructing boxes for heavy items. I tested it out with sealing some boxes shut that have tons of shoes. It sticks very well to boxes and envelopes. The boxes seem to be more sturdy using less tape than I would ordinarily use. I had 4 boxes- all heavy and 3 of the four boxes bottomed out with my regular packing tape. I'll never carry heavy boxes of books again without this tape.

Occasionally I ship quite large and very heavy boxes weighing about 80 pounds to the Philippines via ocean freight.

One of my boxes, which held a multitude of hardback novels, began literally falling apart at the seams.

I intend to use it for boxes of books, but this tape would be helpful for any box whose contents are heavy enough that the box is in danger of losing its bottom when picked up or of bursting if it is dropped.
