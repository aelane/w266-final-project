This is the first printer that I retired before it was actually broken. After this one, I'm never buying another HP printer again. When you turn the printer on for the first time, the touchscreen display walks you through the initial setup, including the WiFi connection. As for as this printer specifically, I can't say I have many complaints, but the paper tray capacity could use an upgrade. I bought this printer in the fall of 2010. The printer is used to print maybe 6 pages a month. I couldn't be happier with this printer! This printer was a replacement for another HP model that I got that had to be sent back for faulty parts. Setting this up basically gives my printer its own e-mail address. I am really happy with this printer.

While the printer is nice, HP still gets 2 stars for how this was handled (they should have been responding to the many posts in their support forums for their new product.. also disappointed that an issue like this made it through whatever testing they do).ORIGINAL REVIEW:Pros:- The printer was relatively easy to set up wireless... worked for a mix of Windows 7 x64 computers and Windows XP laptop (all wireless)- The speed of the printing is quick and the quality of typical documents is nice- Photo printing looked very nice on photo paper- The two trays that come with the printer, one for normal paper and one for photo paper are a fantastic ideaCons:  (arrrghhh... frustrating con, hence the 3 star deduction)- The printer would go to sleep and infrequently never wake up... it would take unplugging and re-plugging the printer power cord to reboot the printer (this takes some time, the printer takes about a minute or so to re-power up).

I am using this printer exclusively over WiFi, and the printer is located in a different room than my computers.
