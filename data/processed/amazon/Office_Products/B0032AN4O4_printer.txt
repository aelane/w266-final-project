Not only does this printer not print borderless photos as claimed, it won't even print a photo on a single page unless it is manually sized to fit within the same printable area required by any printer, which is about 1/8-1/4 inch from each side.I am using Canon's print driver, and the exact photo paper name listed by their driver. I know of no printer that makes such great prints at  anywhere near this price. I'm normally a Canon printer fan... but this unit is so loud that it is a distraction. Having a printer makes me feel more like a real person, if you know what I mean- but being a poor grad student I cannot afford fancy printers/ink. It is pretty fast for a cheap printer like this. Over all functional printer. If you want an economic printer, this is a great choice!Thanks for reading and hope this helped! I can't believe that an inexpensive printer like this is continuing to work so well.Update June, 2013. I am still using this printer and having no problems with it. What we like more wasthat this printer has a OPTION to print only Black without the useof the Color Cartridge in case you are low or out of it (found in theMaintenance  section under "ink cartridges settings" ).

So far, this printer works great.

(I need to move this printer from the floor) I've changed the ink cartridge once.
