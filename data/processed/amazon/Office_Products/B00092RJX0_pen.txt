These are the only pen that works well for a left hander angle. Furthermore the pen can be refilled which are EVEN cheaper.As far as the ink leaking and smearing, I am left handed and use the bolder editions of these pens and have never ran into the problem of smudging the ink or having the ink from the pen leak.Reason for the 4 star rating?- When the ink starts to get low [usually down to about 1/4] they tend to start skipping which can get frustrating.- Personal preference, I prefer the G6 variant as well as the G2 Limited over the regular G2s. Good all purpose pen for daily use. This pen writes well, and the price is perfect (under 5.00). If you have not tried this pen and you love Gel Ink Roller Ball, this pen is for you! Love this pen for several reasons: it's refillable (a huge plus), you can see when it's out of ink, and the ink is very smooth and rarely need to shake it. Still, for an expensive pen that writes very nicely, this is a good deal. This is the only pen we have been using since 2002.

If you want an stylish pen I would not opt for this model.

These are perhaps my favorite pen to write with as far as disposables go.

I just prefer the pen to glide with little resistance.I definitely like the smoothness of the Fine [.7] and Bold [1.0] versions.
