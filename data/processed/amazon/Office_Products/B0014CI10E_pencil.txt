So far she has yet to find a pencil it cannot sharpen. I need a good solid pencil sharpener and purchased this brand. I'm not Oprah and it seems strange to get so excited about a pencil sharpener. Considering how much use our pencil sharpeners get, I'm pleased with the QuietSharp6 but wanted something bigger and heavier for the classroom environment. The pencil sharpener is much larger than I expected it would be. Not only is it a quieter pencil sharpener than my antiquated Panasonic, but it sharpens pencils much faster (in approximately three seconds) and more efficiently. I think it's a fantastic pencil sharpener...and it's large. The pencil shavings tray is huge! Before that I really liked this pencil sharpener. Just when you thought the pencil sharpener went the way of the Do-Do bird, Stanley comes out with this clever unit that is perfect for those who still use pencils and need something that works! Stanley has designed this one to know when its sharpened and stop feeding the pencil forward. I can't stand "chasing" a pencil sharpener across my desk because it wants to scoot everytime you put a pencil into it. and when our old pencil sharpener (a cheap electric one) died on us after a short period of use, I decided to invest in a better quality pencil sharpener.

I've always made do with the frustrating little handheld pencil sharpeners, but no more.

I'd forgotten what it was like to have a truly sharp pencil!I thought this might be a little more pencil sharpener than I needed, until I started sharing it with my mom.

This pencil sharpener is much larger in person than it looks on the internet.
