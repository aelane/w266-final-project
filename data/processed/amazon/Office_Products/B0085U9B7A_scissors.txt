Using scissors for a long stretch often leaves me with a sore hand, so I was hoping that this might be a good alternative method of cutting.The scissors mouse cuts using a small, protected blade on the bottom. It does not match scissors for versatility for either adult or child.This is a new product and the manufacturer brushes aside questions about how and under what circumstances the blade may become dull by saying that, "...you would have to do an awful lot of paper cutting before that would be a problem...I give it two stars for novelty. This is far bettrer than scissors on cutting straing lines. With scissors you can typically see a scissor cut on craft project etc. Because you have to bear down with the scissors, open, then recut, you wind up always with not so perfect lines...a papercut improves that but that sure takes up some room and isn't great on small projects. So you have to eventually pick up those regular scissors for trimming, cutting ribbons, etc. (Like scissors though, it still could cut I think skin...just not as easily.) Sure, it's safer than scissors, because the blade isn't exposed. So, I'd say this scissors mouse is an interesting concept, but I just don't have the patience to learn how to use it. Went back to scissors for the Christmas wrapping. Whenever I try that with regular scissors, I often just crumple or tear the paper instead. Where this will not replace scissors in your home, it is a great addition to your household. Although it's nice but limited, but will not replace my trusty scissors. I'll stick with scissors. It sure beats using a scissors. She likes that you don't have to pick up the scissors during cutting but can keep gift wrap paper flat on a table.It took her a while to get used to lining up the paper inside the plastic "red tongue" but she says it's easy after a little practice. Traditional scissors would work better here.For children I think this would make a good gift. When you think about it, scissors can be really dangerous, especially around children. If there are 'south-paws' scissors searches for the left-handed users in your home or office, the Westcott Scissor Mouse may end the scissors safaris once and for all. While the Scissor Mouse will not ever replace scissors for cutting most items, it is perfect for cutting long sheets of paper. I find that it works better than scissors for cutting wrapping paper. We're back to using scissors. Unlike normal scissors, once you start cutting, you really can't stop. Otherwise...  well, I'd stick with scissors.O
