It uses the same refills so if you like short strips of tape you can get both dispensers and use them appropriately. The refills are easy to find too...Expect to find many uses for this... repair page tears; gift wrapping (gives a neat appearance), etc...http://www.amazon.com/Scotch-PopUp-Refills-Inches-99-G/dp/B002NZG1GC/myshelf The refills seem to be a bit pricey too (75 strips/pad);All in all, the Scotch Deskgrip is a cute little tape dispenser. I haven't priced the refills, but if you wrap a lot of presents during the holidays, you will love this one.There's only one downside: it looks cool, so the kids want to play with it. Buying refills in quantity makes this a much more affordable convenience. Otherwise, the refills are a pain to put in the dispenser. Problem is, I have been unable to find refills for this anywhere and it only comes with one tiny little pad of tape. If I could find refills and they were reasonably priced vs. using a conventional tape dispenser, then I would give this 5 stars. Very handy, very clean and worth looking for the refills! I've already ordered refills for mine. I didn't hesitate to buy refills right away.I recommend Scotch's Pop-Up Refillable Tape Deskgrip Dispenser and their pop-up tape refills. But I'm sure that generic refills will soon appear that will make this dispenser very cost effective to own. I'm sure the refills are much less, as I haven't purchased refills yet. I love that I can buy refills. I don't think I would buy the refills and continue using it. I will be ordering refills!

You really should ask yourself: is it worth it and are the expensive refills worth it too.

I am figuring it will be more expensive than regular refills.

After that, I will not buy refills, because I do not see it as economical.
