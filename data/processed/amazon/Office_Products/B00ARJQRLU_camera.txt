The camera's automatically sync'd to the monitor. We are currently recording one camera in continuous mode and it works great- it breaks the video up into 10 minute segments on the SD card.2) Motion - I was nearly as disappointed with motion recording with this system as I was with the defender system. Between the outside camera and the receiver was, of course, one exterior wall and one interior wall. Otherwise, you simply plug in the camera, plug in the monitor, turn it on and you are set to go. With this camera we will have a good view of anyone attempting to take anything off our front porch.Overall I think this is a good first step in home security, it is reasonably priced and has good night vision quality. If you would benefit from a single camera perspective from around your home or business this product would be a good place to start. The camera is also a tad on the largish side measuring around 4 inches (much larger than a webcam) but has built in LED lights for illumination.When I received this unit I thought I would set up the camera at the front of my house on the porch overhang pointing at my front door. It would have been much better for the camera at least to run off batteries.The wireless part of this unit is the video feed from the camera to the monitor, not the monitor to your home network. Also be prepared to have to rethink where you wish to put the camera due to the power cables length. The camera does a very good job at filming at night. With the single camera as provided those who have a small single entrance such as a row home, professional office, or store front can monitor their property. Basically, you plug the camera and viewing tablet into power sources, and turn them on. The camera does require one, and is probably one of it's biggest downsides. I paired the 3rd & 4th camera to the receiver pretty easily. I like that this camera set was really easy to setup - just turn on, get electricity running, and you've got a nice system. We noticed, though, that the camera kept moving in its positions, and that it had a tendency to fall out of position a lot - kind of like it got "tired," and drooped down at the end of the day. This is for a single camera only, if you add more then of course it lessens the more cams you have hooked up.There's a screen saver mode which also lets you use it as a digital frame but your images are stored on the same card for recording so be aware that it will use memory and lessen your record time. I wish the camera was battery powered!
