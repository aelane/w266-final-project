The dispenser is fairly flimsy as well and I dropped it within a few minutes of receiving it. It still fit back together, but I decided to chunk the dispenser and put the tape in the drawer for later use. I suppose I like the green dispenser, but aside from the color, it's not much different than the standard plastic case. Unless the dispenser is bad, it is kind of just an invisible, not-thought-about item. This dispenser came apart very easily, making it very simple and convenient to switch out the empties. The dispenser I received was purple in color and there is a little bit of a design on the side of the dispenser, they look like vines, but the detail isn't very easy to see unless you are pretty close to the dispenser. But the dispenser doesn't feel very strong to me. This is basically a new dispenser. I like it because it is a little easier to hold than the old dispenser. This new revamped dispenser is better looking and MUCH easier to hold while maintaining the great tape you know to expect from Scotch. Along with that, the dispenser is now ergonomic and it's just a better experience all around.This is a great product with no cons really at all, buy it. The dispenser is very nice for travel or to stow around the house. This little dispenser is a great addition to our utility area/drawer. It pops apart, so you can refill it if you want to be green and not get a whole new dispenser, which is also a plus. The dispenser is very easy to use. Cool dispenser. This dispenser works, of course. This dispenser is nice, the shape is different, and the vivid colors are very cute, this do the work like other scotch tape but the design is nice and easy to handle and is a compact dispenser I like it. To me, this new dispenser looks like something that fell off some carnival ride or something. This new improved dispenser is wonderful, easy on the hands, even small hands when I have little helpers.Am improvement done right. The dispenser does look cute in snail shape. The dispenser had to be opened to remove the cardboard backing. So you need to be careful when you tear it.Once your done with it and you use this dispenser with a cheap tape roll it will break the dispenser in half. Now they've rethought the dispenser. This dispenser has weight and size in its corner contrasted to other dispensers. I guess I could call this dispenser with the tape a "frustration free tape dispenser" and feel fully comfortable with it. I certainly wouldn't pay extra for it over a traditional dispenser containing the same amount of tape. I received the pink floral dispenser. The dispenser itself is attractive and easy to hold. That said, I'm not convinced that this dispenser is worth the extra money. The dispenser is not only cute and fun, but it's ergonomically designed and fits into my hand nicely. From looking at the dispenser it appears you can re-use it by purchasing tape refills. This is a handy little dispenser that fits well in a drawer of looks great on the desk top. I like this dispenser because it fits comfortably in my hand when I am wrapping a present and it fits in my pencil cup. Also, the reusable dispenser doesn't "click" together - my old one was the same way, and I ended up taping it shut or it would open up during use. The dispenser is cool, and kind of reminds me of a dinosaur. This is a nice little dispenser of tape. It does seem to be a little less *harsh* than the old dispenser, which is just this clear, sharp-edged plastic thing. The new dispenser is decorative, colorful, and has a lot of curves. The dispenser is new & actually works better than the traditional dispensers because it curves downward at the end. This dispenser is greatly improved; it actually fits in palm of my hand and makes it so much easier to get the tape out.
