I like to write a note as I think about it so having something mounted to the wall and not being able to write on it (like a dry erase pad for example) doesn't help me.If I'm using a post it note, it's because I had a sudden idea that I had to remember and in the time for me to pull it out of the container and grab the pen, I've forgotten why I wanted to write something down.I was really disappointed in this product and won't be using it in the future. Ever wonder where you left your post-it note pad? !You can stick to wall it holds a pen and you are always ready to take/write a note /memo/phone numberNice looking Use them at my shop and at home by phone as wellStudents could use at computer deskGreat little product and ideaoh yes , stays well Good adhesive This is good for keeping your note paper handy, stick it on the wall by the phone, by the computer, stick it to your outside door (as long as it is protected from the weather and people can leave a note if they drop by when you are gone. I'm really happy with this Post-It note dispenser and pen holder unit that attaches to a wall or wherever you want to keep your Post-Its. Do note that you need to get the pop-up post-it's and the regular ones wont work with this. This little note holder and paper are a fast way to leave notes and mark anything on your calender. This is a typical post-it note dispenser with a little hole for holding a pen. Also, the same Post-it note can be repeatedly used on both sides. If you need a note station, this is a perfect and affordable solution. They're also great for leaving a note on the front door for delivery or repair people, as they hold up to the Chicagoland wind.POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS:I wish that they had included a magnetic option, but you could always DIY it using magnetic tape. Well, if you suffer from the buried Post-It note, can't find my pen syndrome like I do, you just might find the Post-it Pop-up Notes Dispenser one of the most useful office products you never knew you needed. I can conveniently grab a post-it note whenever I need one without having to sift through my desk drawer.The dispenser sticks to the wall using mildly adhesive tape and Velcro-like material. I received two of these Post-it note pop up holders. The Post It Pop Up note dispenser is a little item that is really useful for taking messages at home or work. Seems it use to be whenever I wanted a post-it note I couldn't find one but now I always know exactly where they are!

This is a nice pop-up note & pen holder.

As you pull out one note, it pulls the next one up behind it, exposing the non- sticky end for the next pull.

Well, until I take a note and stick it in my wallet.
