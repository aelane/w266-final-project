The fax set up - super easy. The fax was easily set up through the PC and the test in and out faxes came and went without a problem.The printer is larger than I expected and it is heavy so it will need to stay put. I don't need the fax option: but if you do, I'm sure it's a winner. I really liked being able to "print" to the fax machine. A fax machine is generally an antiquated concept, but for the times you HAVE to do it, I prefer being able to just print my document via fax as opposed to the old way of printing it out, and faxing it via physical paper. First it receives the fax, then you have the option to print it out, an option I personally really appreciate having come from a much older model fax machine. When I have to send a fax, I scan the document and use a website like myfax or faxzero. I think there may be some native fax features on the Epson driver from the website, but didn't want any extra Epson crapware as is common with printer manufacturers. Unable to select fax as "printer" on Mac 10.6.8 even though it appeared as such (print button grayed-out).This printer is promoted as reducing printing costs by 50%; I have of course no way of knowing at this point what such a claim means. I have not yet set up the fax feature.PRINT QUALITY / FEATURESI am very impressed with the print quality, both color and B&W. The fax portion was easy to set up as well. I did not set up the fax, therefore can not comment on that...I much prefer to scan to a pdf file and e-mail documents and this printer makes that a snap, so why bother with a fax?b.)

The fax one was greyed out and didn't work when I tried to use it for the first time.

I was able to test it by faxing a dummy fax to 1-888-877-1655 (a toll free number for a site called faxtoy daht net).

So the fax worked quite well.
