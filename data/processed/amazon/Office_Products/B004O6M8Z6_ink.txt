The ink is liquid and visible through the barrel of the marker. The ink flows freely through the tip. * Colorfast ink that doesn't run when you wash it. * Permanent ink that stays put when you wash it.Just like with any other Sharpie product, keep these out of reach from small kids, because when they say "permanent", they really mean it.Have fun! Those tend to "eat up" ink but there was little feathering and bleeding.Think the pricing is a consideration for future purchases. This seems to dry and set the ink the best. Still, after a few washes the ink definitely starts to fade. They will write, but the ink bleeds a little and is washed out on paper. The ink in these doesn't bleed the way most permanent markers do.

The ink will take on a variety of surfaces.

Their very fluid ink and brush tips make it pretty easy to mark on fabric.
