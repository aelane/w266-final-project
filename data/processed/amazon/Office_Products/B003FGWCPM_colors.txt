The colors are strong, the cap has a positive "click" to help ensure that the cap is replaced correctly, and they both write and erase cleanly. I love all six colors, none of which is faded or hard to read (yellow is a frequent failing color for dry erase, but is not too bad in this model). The included colors are bright and it is easy to remove drawings with just a paper towel. For one, the colors are not that vibrant, nor are they very visible. The BIC Great Erase Grip Pocket Dry Erase Marker, Fine Point, Assorted colors six pack is a great set. All colors except orange (which was a little washed out) were nice and bold. No useless colors like yellow.Cons:  Getting the cap off/on is far more difficult than it should be. The colors are nice (and no yellow! The colors erase well, they don't stain the boards at all, which some markers can do. The other colors are bright and easily distinguished from one another. The colors are nice and I think they are plenty  dark enough for our purpose. The provided colors -- black, red, green, orange, blue and purple -- allow you to color schedules or shopping lists.I tested these pens on two dry-erase boards and noticed excellent readability and more important, ease in wiping off with a paper towel. Love all the colors to define special projects and areas of concern.Use this in many meetings and has helped define areas of interest easily by color.Recommend this for all white board users. All of the colors erase easily after 7 days of testing except the tepid orange color. The other colors I tried were also dark and clear. The colors erase easly and the ink in the pens lasted for some time. These have a very nice tip.Additionally, the colors are fantastic!The only improvement I can suggest would be an eraser at the end. The colors are bold enough to be seen across the classroom. I found the some of the colors were "watery" - the purple and red were not as bright as I was expecting, and the red marker dried up after only a couple days of use. The colors are bold and easily visible from everywhere in a large classroom, as well. Most colors erase well.They look like permanent markers so I have to make sure which pens I'm using. The colors are very pretty and vibrant.
