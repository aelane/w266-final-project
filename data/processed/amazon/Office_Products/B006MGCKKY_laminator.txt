The larger laminator lets me do things I need to do for my son's school projects or my daughter's nursery school class (where we volunteer).Size isn't the only plus here. This laminator has settings my smaller, older model didn't. The laminator offers cool lamination for self-adhesive pouches and heat lamination for 3- and 4-mil pouches. If you are looking for a basic laminator for light home or small office use, this one will suit your needs. A laminator is a long-term investment, and should last you years and many, many documents.Remember to place the document in the laminating pouch/sheet and position it perfectly! I was very surprised at how well this laminator worked and how easy it was to use, especially for the price. The laminator is fast and efficient and does a good job. I'm not sure how well this laminator would hold under heavy use, but for the occasional tasks I ask of it, it seems well-suited. Though this may not be the tiniest personal laminator on the market, a little room on a desk allows for one of the handiest small-scale laminators I have seen. "This laminator is compact and easy to use and store. As advertised, this laminator's exterior remains cool to the touch, so I'm not worried about being burned. This laminator lives up to its billing. I don't anticipate ever needing to buy another laminator. This laminator is a vast improvement over the last one that I used at work. The old laminator required that anything being laminated be placed between a cover. This laminator also comes with the option to do cold laminations, something the old one didn't have at all.All in all, it's a great laminator. I have a larger laminator at my workplace that is 3x the size, yet doesn't do a better or faster job than this one. The laminator heated up within minutes, which is considered acceptable by most standards, and did the necessary 8x11 sizes they needed with little to no difficulty.All in all, they were very pleased during the time they had to use it.My analysis may seem simplistic but, in an age where we have buttons and apps for just about everything, it's nice to see a device that is simplistic enough for the elderly staff at the church office to figure out, and gets the job done with little to no difficulty. This is my first laminator unit and I'm very pleased with it. Immediately on receiving this personal laminator my sister and I set it up and started reading through the direction. The laminator is small and easy to store. This is a great personal laminator. This laminator is a good size, but the actual footprint is small compared to others. Once you feel the laminator taking the item you can let go as it is pulled through the laminator. (The laminator controls are named on the next page and I found myself flipping back and forth to figure out what control the instructions were talking about.) This little laminator does a great job at a very reasonable price.
