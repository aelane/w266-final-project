It auto-stops when it has given the pencil a sharp point without grinding off any extra. All pencil sharpeners will do this, but the dial on this one gives nice straight results.We are very pleased. Best pencil sharpener I've used. And a lop-sided pencil has to be resharpened more often (since the point runs into the wood quickly on the short side ). This pencil sharpener promises to sharpen quickly, quietly, and cleanly. A very nice pencil sharpener indeed for the classroom or library. I was surprised at how quickly the Bostitch QuietSharp pencil sharpener sharpens dull, blunt tips into perfect, sharp points. It was effortless to push the pencil in. If they'd had pencil sharpeners like this when I was a kid in school, maybe I'd have done better. The finest and most versatile pencil sharpener I have ever used. I love this pencil sharpener!

This electric pencil sharpener was designed to be used in classrooms.

I reinserted the pencil and within a second or two a perfect, extremely sharp point was produced without reducing the length of the pencil dramatically.The "selector dial" turns easily and accommodates 6 sizes of pencils: 5 standard diameters from 6.8mm-11.5mm and the 3 sided Tri-Write.

You insert your pencil into the correct opening, hold it lightly and the sharpening begins.
