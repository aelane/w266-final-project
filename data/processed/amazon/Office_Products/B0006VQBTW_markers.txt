The brand-new markers wrote like very well-worn dry-erase markers even when pressing down firmly. But these markers seems harder to erase than other we've used and the erasers don't cut it. If you're looking for some markers to put some fun colors on the whiteboard, these will work fine. These whiteboard markers come in gorgeous, bright colors with a nice fine point that makes your whiteboard writing much more legible than standard markers. These are good markers for a white-board (or I guess anywhere you might use dry-erase markers). These are pretty nice markers especially for drawing. These are handy dry-erase markers, especially if your marker-board is magnetic. It works great, and these markers wipe very cleanly off the board. These markers solved that problem. So I got these markers to use for that and they work great. I thought these markers would be a little better than what they are. The markers last a long time too and have not yet run out. When I saw these markers, all my problems were solved in one package. I'll be curious to see how long these markers last, but for now I'd say we're satisfied. With other markers I've tried, even those claiming to be 'fine tipped', I've found it difficult to write in small clear print; these mini-markers have a very fine tip, making them ideal for small writing. Most of the markers we have used in the past were large. The markers are non-toxic and don't seem to have much of an odor. These are far from the markers I grew up using with odors so strong I'd feel sick and sometimes come down with a headache!Other than the variety of colors and the handy reusable pouch the set of mini markers arrives in that I like is the magnetic caps. But usually the markers hold well enough to cling to a fridge or on a magnetic dry erase board without issue (I've found these fit perfectly into the top clip some dry erase boards have). These markers are super small. I was looking for low odor smaller markers for my 4yr old who likes to &#34;write&#34; on a white board and the built in erasers are excellent for her little hands as are the smaller markers. When I ordered these markers, I thought the colors would be bold. Whiteboard markers should have a fine tip, vivid colors and a quick-drying ink so I don't smear my hands. I'm using the markers with a non-Quarter whiteboard. The ReWritables mini dry-erase markers arrived at the same time I received theQuartet Arc Cubicle Combination Board. I wasn't sure what to expect with these dry-erase markers after reading the other reviews but I took the plunge since I *need* dry-erase markers for a project I'm involved with for the next few months. The markers are low-odor, which is appreciated when using them a lot! The markers come packaged in a clear reusable pouch, something that is not common among other brands.The colors were all vibrant except the yellow (as expected). I picked up these markers because I use them daily in my job as a teacher. The markers themselves are fine tipped which makes them great for detail work, but not ideal for writing so that a larger audience can see the work on the whiteboard.The tips themselves were smaller than I anticipated, but the color of each marker was vibrant. I was skeptical about these markers, given how inexpensive they are. Hang the markers with their tip side down to save on ink. They are "mini" markers which provide a bright, fine line for writing in small spaces. These markers work as well as any others. The markers come with a built-in eraser in the cap which is fine for a quick fix for something, but you wouldn't try to use it to erase an entire board. We have used these markers for awhile now. The markers sit comfortably in the board's holder and the cap of the marker also has a dry eraser, which you can use to erase the whiteboard. The markers write reasonably well -- with the exception of the yellow marker which will barely show up on the whiteboard. These markers are awesome; they very easily solve the problem of not having an eraser for your white board handy. These markers are great for magnetic dry erase boards and to keep on the fridge next to a dry erase board. Cheap markers, and that's what you get. I've had similar markers last for several years, so I'll see if these hold up well. Sadly, I would not recommend these markers. There's only so much you can say about dry-erase markers. These markers have been perfect. These tiny markers are cute and fun, and they are convenient as well, since they have a magnet included and will thus stick to your magnetic whiteboard. Stick with classroom-grade markers like Expo.I'm a serious white board user, but I still like these as a playful accessory. Having magnetic markers nearby and out of the reach of the kids, allows me to manage the tic marks easier and cosmetically make it more appealing. I have been using the markers quite steadily over a month and no drying or fading has occurred. while the markers are on the small side, I find it more useful for placing them on my side of my refrigerator. I was really hoping for some bright, easy to use markers for my son's dry-erase board to prompt his creativity. I previously gave the markers four stars, but after using them for a longer amount of time, I'm giving them one star. These markers aren't dark enough, bright enough, opaque enough or however you want to say it- to make it easy to read.The lines it leaves aren't exactly crisp either- meaning the edges can look a bit blurry for folks whose eyes don't focus as well anymore- like mine. They use these markers to do those worksheets and it works great because there is a fine point and a small eraser right on the lid.The magnets actually hold the pens to the file cabinet well (which I didn't expect) but the erasers do fall out rather easily, so be aware of that if you have pets or small children around. Some became so intrigued that the markers became distractions as they played with the magnet and pulled out the eraser.The markers themselves didn't last long and don't have that bold, dark look I like in markers, not even when first opened. I don't see these markers as long term use, but they are fun and my daughter enjoys creating designs on my white board with them, so they are accomplishing their purpose. I'm used to fine-point markers drying out mid sentence, but these held up well.The eraser on the cap is not new or exclusive, but it works and is handier than a big eraser, and a lot better than using your finger (which is a no-no if you want your white board to last).The colors are not as bright as the caps, but they are accurate. The colored markers allow him more creativity. These markers are smaller than I expected, (SEE PICTURE) but then again there are some pretty compact dry erase boards for use in lockers, on refrigerators, etc.Including the sizable cap, these are just shy of 4-3/4 inches long.
