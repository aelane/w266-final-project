I got that along with a nicely designed case that doesn't require me to find a long-term storage solution for of these wonderful markers. But this case is awesome. And the little fold-up case, though a bit cheap, is completely handy and usable.What I like about these markers is that the colors are really nice, usable colors, even the light colors. They come in a plastic case for storage. With this case, we just click it shut and toss it in the closet. The case also has a holding area for pens being used during a project. They come in a cleverly designed fold-out book-type case and the colors are really beautiful. The case itself, for the packaging that these come in, isn't going to last you longer than the markers will, as far as durability is concerned, but it is smartly designed so that it holds the markers in place without them shifting around on you. The case is great at keeping them organized.I have been a graphic designer for over a decade and am very impressed with these pens, I highly recommend. Don't do like I did and try opening the case in a hurry on the right edge, use the tab on the lower left to open it right and protect the case. The case also unfolds allowing the user to quickly see all the colors available.4) Bleed through -- As these are permanent markers, bleed through can be expected. The case actually holds them and is reusable, reclosable, and functional. The carrying case is so so.
