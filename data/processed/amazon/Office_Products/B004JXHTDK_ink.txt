The ink flows out very smoothly and evenly, with no blotching or difficulty. These are true liquid ink pens (not ballpoint) that flows from the barrel smoothly. The ink is heat-sensitive so it it removed via heat, and not the actual material of the eraser. The ink does run out more quickly than the G2 which has been my regular pen, but it doesn't dry out when left uncapped for a few hours.. The ink disappears with, well, friction (hence the clever spelling/word play of the pen's name) from the rubbery nib on the end of the pen, and there's absolutely no muss or eraser crumbs, and no tearing of the paper. The ink disappears immediately when the marks come in contact with an iron. The ink rubs away cleanly and without smudging or damage to the underlying paper. It was cool to see the ink disappear like magic! The ink returned (although slightly less vivid than the original) after a short while in the freezer. Then I held it upright, and the ink started again. I remember using the old erasable ink ball pens from 10+ years ago. Naturally, seeing these new friction-remove ink pens, I was a bit skeptical.
