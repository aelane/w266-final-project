The knurled grip is a combo of knurled metal and silicone pads, giving nice grip without grinding your fingers. They would have been better to stick with the 500's grip system.Finally, the clip. I like the grip - the silicone bumps add comfort and traction to the knurled aluminum (though I'm not sure how they'll last long term). It's fairly thin but the grip is a bit wider which I find better than the much larger Dr. The grip section has both cross-hatched machining and rubberized interior, providing both a strong hold and yet a softer grip. The grip section rotates with a small window to allow you to indicate which hardness of lead you have loaded. The grip is partially rubber. Better grip, I guess, but also a sweat/slime trapper.2.

Also I like the grip of the rough metal surface which is pleasant and provides precise control over your writing.

Unfortunately it's rubber grip would break down over time and the tip wasn't as solid/stiff as some others, so my home/work desk pencil was the Alvin Draftmatic.But now with the Y&C; Double Knock no longer being made, the best modern equivalent is the GraphGear 1000 with its retractable tip.

They "improved" on the GraphGear 500 grip by putting rubber bubbles along the otherwise great metal grip.
