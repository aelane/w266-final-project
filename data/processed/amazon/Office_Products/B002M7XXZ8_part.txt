What I do not like is that when one writes on the transparent part, the writing all but disappears when the NoteTab is placed over a text passage in a book - it kind of merges with the actual text in the book. The transparent part is also more functional than the smallerAvery NoteTabs Round Edge, 2 x 1.5 Inches, Pastel Blue and Green, 20 per pack (16296), simply because it offers a larger space to mark text. You can read through that part so its fine if it goes over text. The see-through part is a nice touch--makes it perfect for highlighting, especially if, like me, you often change your mind. Then, you can write on the transparent part of the attached note tab, either writing your own notes to supplement or summarize material, or "underlining" text in the book, without actually marking up the text!.I was thrilled to get these, and the ways I can use them are endless. The larger part of the tab is about the standard size of traditional sticky notes. The part that sticks to the page is clear, so it's OK if it covers up some of the text and you can write on the whole thing. I'm not sure why the sticky part is SO BIG but since you can see through it and you can write on it, I guess it isn't that big of a deal... plus you could always trim it smaller, if you really needed to. The tab part of the note is sturdy and allows you to grip and turn pages without worrying about ripping your note.

The transluscent part is about 3 inches square and sticks well to paper; the tab portion is a typical tab, approximately 1-1/2 inches across and 1/2 inch tall at its highest point; you can write on either tab and adhesive section, so there's plenty of room for a few lines of notes.

The sticky part is reusable and transparent, so it won't hide anything you might want to read.

The tab part is seamlessly attached to the sturdy plastic part, which is about the size of a post-it note.
