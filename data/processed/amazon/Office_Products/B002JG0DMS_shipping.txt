Not only can use these for the actual shipping label, you can use blank ones to cover up blemishes and marks on used boxes. I've already been glad I had these for shipping packages in reused Amazon boxes! Personally, I'll pass and buy the cheaper traditional white shipping labels. I often re-use my Amazon shipping cartons to send stuff through the mail or via UPS and these nice big kraft-colored labels have made that much easier. However, I don't print the shipping address on them because UPS requires their own labels with barcodes and etc. But if you want a brown shipping label, this is a good choice. These shipping labels - Ink Jet and Laser, Brown Kraft are great - especially if you reuse boxes for shipping. I've used Avery's white Internet shipping labels which have "true block" technology -- these have a gray backing behind the white label that makes the label quite opaque. These aren't everyday shipping labels for me. If you are doing heavy shipping, buying Avery by the 50 pack really becomes and expense and does not save you anything.

All while using these as shipping labels as well.These work great at covering up other labels.

It allows the shipping information to stand out and that is what you need.

If you like to reuse shipping boxes and quickly want to cover old labels, this does the job just fine.
