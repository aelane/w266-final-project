The ink probably takes a few seconds to dry beyond smearing.The pocket clip works fine. The ink flows more smoothly and yields a better end result. The ink dried quickly, with no smearing, and, according to the package, it is acid-free. The ink dries quickly on the page, yet flows out quickly and smoothly. It has a very consistent and reliable ink flow without any skipping, and it writes very smoothly thanks to the 0.7 tip. The ink seems to dry pretty quickly too. Putting down too much ink is a problem because as a lefty your hand tends to move over the words that you just wrote and if there is excess ink on the page it gets smeared by your hand as you write. The ink has a nice flow and there's no skipping. The ink looks beautiful once it dries, but it can smudge beforehand. The ink flowed so smoothly, and because it was retractable, I didn't have to constantly keep track of the cap. The ink doesn't smear -- and I absolutely know that after shuffling piles of index cards filled with quotes, dates, and other information.Hey, after all, it's just a pen. Also has acid free ink. The ink sets up as soon as you write on regular paper but if you write on slick cardboard, it doesn't, but it sets up after awhile. Also the ink takes a bit to dry, so it is easy to smear for the first few seconds after writing.All in all a very solid pen for a disposable pen product. The ink dries quickly. The ink flowed out so smoothly, writing feels effortless. You can smudge the ink if you try really hard (roll the tip to form a thick layer of ink, then rub your finger over it). It is stylish, balanced, easy to grip, not too heavy, and the ink comes out nice and smooth. The ink, for the most part, comes out smoothly and dries quickly. It tends to gather ink around the edge of the tip and splotch a little if held at too low of an angle. I just wish I had one with blue ink. It appears to be very well made.Changing the ink out: The tip of the pen screws off allowing the user to replace the ink. The ink will smudge, though, if you accidentally touch it while writing. The ink is not waterproof.

The ink will also bleed and at times doesn't write smoothly, yet it times it promotes beautiful penmanship.

The BIC ink was darker and again, smoother.Not only does it write well, it draws well.

I did manage accidentally to smear the ink where I had some cross-hatching.
