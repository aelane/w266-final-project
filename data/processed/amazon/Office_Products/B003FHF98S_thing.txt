And the best thing is that up to four people can use this at once, as each can have their own tape dispenser.Pretty cool. One tiresome thing about the holidays is wrapping gifts and having to use an ordinary tape dispenser. One thing I especially like about this kit is that the pieces of tape are precut, ready to apply. The only negative thing I have to say about the handband dispenser is that it is initially pretty difficult to open. one thing i didn't like was that i couldn't tell when i was running low on tape, so once in a while i was caught short in the middle of wrapping, and the easy pop-up dispenser makes it almost too easy to zip through refills. 'Scotch Pop Up Tape Dispenser and Refills' are quite a handy thing to have around especially during the holidays! The only thing I didn't like is that it was difficult to open the dispenser to insert the refills. This thing is so easy to use, and saves time and mess when doing any kind of gift wrapping, or small jobs where you need small strips of tape: crafts, etc... I love this thing! Some gimmicky thing just to make money, I thought. On less thing to remember to purchase. I guess it's a good thing because this means the holder is easy to slide around on the desk so it's not in the way, but I think I would have liked it better with a real suction cup on the back.Overall, if you can get these cheap enough, they definitely make package wrapping much more quick and easy than a regular dispenser, and I think I use less tape with them than with a regular handheld unit. I always end up pulling the thing off the surface without any tape dispensed. Please be careful so you don't do the same thing I did.
