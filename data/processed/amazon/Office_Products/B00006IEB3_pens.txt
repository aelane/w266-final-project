I bought these pens for my grandson. These are long lasting pens. These are neat pens, in my experience I haven't had a single one of them leak. I love pens with fine points and this pen gives me something even better. These pens have never leaked before and they look very stylish. Since I don't like to use red pens when grading essays, I love that I can use fun colors like purple, pink, and green, and my students always comment on how much they like it that I don't use red.I hope that Pilot never discontinues these! The Pilot Precise V5 pens are my favorite roller ball pens. Either the pens are not as smooth as they used to be, or it was somewhat of a dud. These have been my favorite pens for well over the last 5 years. I have had one of these pens leak on occasion. However, in general I have found these pens to last well, be fairly durable and comfortable, and to write very well. I love these pens. Great pens!Be careful, they soak through.Brilliant colors. I've tried many pens over the years, and these are my favorite.
