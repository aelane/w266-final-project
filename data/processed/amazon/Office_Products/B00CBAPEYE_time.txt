This was my first time around the block with an Epson and I wish I'd discovered it earlier. I had a run time error on my vista desktop but not on a vista laptop or a win 7 laptop, the printer installed fine. First, is the time it takes to print. Having said that, if time is not an issue, then it might not be an issue for you.Set-up was fairly simple. At least at this time, I haven't found the "XL" (high-capacity) cartridges on Amazon.com or at local office supply stores. and for a long time I was a devoted Epson fan. It was really cheap at the time when I bought it and for the price it's certainly a great printer. I had one from a long time ago which fortunately worked with this machine. This time, the set-up was a breeze.The printer itself is quiet and fast.

Next time I turn my printer on, the items will automatically print.

I really have a hard time believing this is a $99 printer.

In the mean time I will have my old Canon printer repaired and use the Epson only for scanning and copying.
