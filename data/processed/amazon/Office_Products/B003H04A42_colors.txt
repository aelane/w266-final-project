The colors are bright and easy to see, though I would love the option of several different colors in different shades (bright colors and softer tones).One note - if you're sensitive to smells you may notice that these Post-it notes have an aroma to them (unlike regular Post-it notes which I noticed no aroma). The nice bold colors make sure they'll be noticed. The colors make them easy to see and I was surprised that they even stick on the rough plastic bins. I liked the bright colors, they're very eye catching and contrast well with most surfaces or containers you'd stick the label. The colors are distinctive but not garish. The bright colors make them hard to miss and they really stay put even after several days. The colors are bright so you know where to look. I love the Neon colors. They come in two different Neon colors. Lastly, the colors are also bright and fun, which make labeling toys and other office files easy to detect. Also, perhaps adding two more bright colors would further help color coding. It'd be nice if they came in more appealing colors, but since the point is their functionality, that's what I'm judging them on, and I'm giving them five stars. I like the bright colors, and super-sticky adhesive. The colors are bright and not hideous.

I love bright colors, and these are very bright!There is no missing these labels!They are very sticky but yet easy to remove without leaving nasty sticky residue once removed.You can use these to label just about anything, folders, drawers, kids stuff, whatever these are multifunctional labels!I added these to my file cabinet folders, and to label craft drawers.You can cut these to smaller sizes also

I still love these though and will continue to buy them, if they come in more calming colors.

The colors are bright so it is easy to locate them when trying to determine the contents of the box.2.
