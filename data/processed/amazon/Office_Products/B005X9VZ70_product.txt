I prefer this product to my previous Brother model. I'm going to admit right off that I was a little biased coming into this product. I don't know if the Brother supports a similar product, but the label cartridges I have always purchased for the Brother are much harder to peel back once they are printed.Overall, if small size is most important for you, then the Dymo is a great little unit with a lot of functionality. The Dymo 160 is generally a solid product that can be used to tackle all sorts of labeling projects.Construction is comparable to other products of this type...nothing really stands out, either pro or con versus the Epson or Brother products I've also used. I really love this product. But I'm going to look for a better product, this one isn't quite it. The product also features an auto-shut off when the item is not in use, which conserves the batteries. Excellent product for a variety of household uses, especially for under $25. Overall, I really like this product, and can strongly recommend it. This product is great! It is a very good product in and of itself. When a product is easy to use, you don't even need to consult the instructions, and so it is for this label-maker. The product is shaped a little differently, but about the same general size. It is a good product besides the painful punctuation entry. Granted they are cheaper than the comparable Brother product, but that is not an excuse to rip-off the consumer. It should just be included with a product like this. DO not buy this product unless you have AC Adapter or buy AC Adapter with the unit. So all in all, it's a good product. This is a good, inexpesive product for basic labeling. Great product.
