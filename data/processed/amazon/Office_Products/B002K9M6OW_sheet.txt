The you type in what ever info you want, put a sheet of the labels into your printer and hit print. I had to laugh at myself after I used the first sheet of these labels... I used the sheet of these labels (in green) as envelope sealers for my handmade Christmas cards. or HAPPY HOLIDAYS!, etc.Each sheet is a different color, which is good. Just include a fourth sheet of Blue!! You can feed the sheet through the printer after you print one or two labels to print more so there is no wasted labels if you only print onw or two at a time. There is not a template sheet included in the box to test the printer alignment - but this wasn't a problem for me. Nonetheless, there is a handy sheet with "printing tips" for those who have never printed labels before -- for those who are seasoned label printers, you can dump this right away.These are in beautiful neon colors - cyan, magenta, green, and yellow (yes, I'm using printer color speak here.) These are on a sheet of wax paper so you just peel and stick. Each sheet comes with 30 labels, and they are compatible with the Avery 5160 template. Each sheet has 30 labels on it and each label is 1 inch by 2 5/8 inch.
