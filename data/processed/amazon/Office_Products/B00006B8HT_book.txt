So, now it props up my huge Shakespeare book (about 2" thick? I put the Shakespeare book on a mat, turned the 'sturdy stand' upside down and turned the back legs TOWARD each other. Much better than your typical book holder, because it tilts backwards, and the upside down 'hooks' add support.Okay, so now suppose you don't need to read a book. Very intuitive to use.Strength - as I've mentioned, it can hold a small to medium book. Excellent little book stand for the desk - but will hold a book no more than 1-1/2" thick, so don't expect it to hold a dictionary. If you want a really wonderful book holder for that purpose, I recently discovered theBookbax(which is also good for holding the Kindle and Kindle Fire and other tablet readers). Inexpensive, easy to keep with you, and very effective for holding a book in place at the page you need it at. How powerful of a book stand do you want for 5 bucks?

I used various book stands similar to these for several years, until I got my big desk, and I needed something to hold BIG books open.

For that I got four of the deluxe book stands in wood, which could hold the largest study Bible.

It holds the book open, the legs are adjustable to make the posts that hold the book open wider or closer together.
