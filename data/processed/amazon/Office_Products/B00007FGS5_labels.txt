These labels are beautiful, dainty, and gold.Labels also make like easier.And these labels are for ink jet printers - that's the type of printer I have. These labels look good and are fairly easy to print out. Well, here are labels that I use and design the content to suit my desire. These labels are great quality, but gold foil is so 1980's, and these look so cheap. Although the labels are quite shiny, they work perfectly with an ink-jet printer. The labels have sufficient room for a logo next to your name and address. This probably says more about the HP than about the Avery labels, but it's worth noting.Avery has a template for the 8257 at their website; that's the appropriate template for these 8987 labels. The Avery labels have a distinguished, rich look to them which can give the 'touch of class' many of us love to an envelope. These labels REALLY look good. These labels are PERFECT for my Christmas cards. Avery labels have never let me down before, and they didn't this time either. I'm very happy with these labels. These Avery Gold Foil labels are both snazzy in appearance and also stick very well to whatever it is that you're labeling. Included with the labels are a set of instructions for formatting and printing, which I would rate based on my experience as being extremely easy to follow. If I run out, I will certainly consider purchasing more of these labels to use.Oh, and I would agree that using bold print would be a smart choice with these labels. If you touch the labels immediately after printing they will be ruined. Even after allowing the labels to sit for 30 minutes touching a moist finger to the label will smear it severely. 30 labels per sheet, with a really nice gold finish that looks sharp. These Avery Gold Inkjet labels were just what I was looking for. The labels are nicely metallic in appearance. I've also used them to make labels to put in books that I loan to friends, in the hope that the book will someday find its way back home.They feed perfectly in my HP Photosmart inkjet printer. However, touching them before allowing the labels to dry smeared the ink -- all over the page AND my fingers.When following the above rules, my labels were high quality and free of smears. The labels are thick enough they didn't crease when I removed them from the sheet. They really are pretty labels, but the success of printing on them will depend greatly on each individual printer. I don't know how many pre-printed labels I get from one source or another, but most of them manage to either spell my name wrong or butcher my address. I've been an Avery labels fan forever. Quick and easy.I ran the labels through an Epson Artisan 810 inkjet multi-function printer.
