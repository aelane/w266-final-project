The point stayed sharp (so I guess the mechanism to rotate the lead works). How much sharper a point would you really ever need?2. The point is fine and it produces a crisp clear smooth line. As for the first point, I'm not really in a position to test the strength of the lead vs. other types, but I would note that the benefit would depend on one always using diamond-infused lead in the pencil, which is certainly not a given. Not only does the point stay sharp, it is great for detail work and fine print, and the lead doesn't break when you press a little more firmly. The point stays sharp but it doesn't damage the writing surface.A few of the reviewers have remarked that the pencil is lightweight and slippery -- the plastic housing not as nice as it could be. I always have a sharp, clean point and can sketch out projects in detail. Its tiny to the point where whenever somewhat vigorous amount of force is applied to erase a pencil mark, the eraser actually falls out of the pencil. It maintains a sharp point and the leads are harder to break (at least they seem to be). And the point stayed sharp.THE SKINNY:::I really liked this mechanical pencil and will probably buy one for the kids. And in a 0.7mm at some point. Always the perfect point. The point doesn't break and the fine tip allows for better writing.My only complaint is the tiny eraser.
