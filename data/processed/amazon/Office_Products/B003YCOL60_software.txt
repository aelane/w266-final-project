The software was a breeze and it gives you an option to discard the filler on the disc if all you want is the basics, love that. Oh I did have to install some software on my computer but that was really quick and easy on my Mac.This printer is called the world's fastest all-in-one (for its price point) and it definitely is - I am no longer waiting for what seems like forever for that coupon to pint so I can run to the store! The software allows a 4100 dpi setting that took 36 minutes to scan the 8x10, and had no more resolution than the 1200 setting. The software allowed me to print a test page or scan a test document. The software for Windows 7 is great and stable and fast. It's quick and the software that came with it makes it easy to crop your scan to your selection, then scan multiple pages of the same height and width.If you are printing a document with photos you should take note to change your printer's settings to print "Text and Photos," if you don't your photos will come out with bland lines  through the middle.I think this is a wonderful printer that I will continue to use years from now. The software installed fine on her Macbook and out came test documents. The software strikes a good balance between simple-to-use and being sufficiently capable. I inserted the supplied software CD in my 64-bit Windows 7 system and, when it was about 2/3 through with the install, got an error message from Windows saying that the "EpsonNet Print" program did not support this version of Windows. Overall, I found the Epson software install to be far superior to HP's. After installing the software it said there was a problem with connecting to the computer through my wireless router. I reinstalled the software and the error message disappeared, but the problem did not.
