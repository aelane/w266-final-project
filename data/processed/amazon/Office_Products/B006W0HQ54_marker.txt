I think this is half-way between a permanent "marker" and the better tips on a non-permanent pen.One problem I have run into with other pens with a foam rubber tip is that they tend to clog/get caked with ink and become less smooth/don't flow ink as evenly as they dry out. I know I should expect that with using a permanent marker but the smell lingered for a little too long for my taste.But I do like the color variation and I'm sure I'll find something to use these markers for. This marker did seem to work ok on a plastic milk bottle, although after 15 minutes some of the ink did partially rub off with a paper towel.But the problems with this 'brush tip' design go beyond the above issues. As a marker, it didn't fade on plastic or glass.Given how much ink is used with thick lines and fill-ins, I don't know how long this will last and this could be a key factor for those who are heavy users.Nice mix of colors. For a pen and marker addict this is a great tool to use for caligraphy and when you want to fill in huge spaces in your lettering or artwork. I didn't mind this, but it does make the marker feel clunky and clumsy in your grip. $1.43 per marker (on sale at this review writing) they aren't extremely overpriced either. This marker features a thicker barrel with shorter grip, which for me is quite comfy, and it feels as though I have great control over the line. That's this marker's claim to fame, and I was definitely eager to test that claim. The marker ran and seemed to flow away, much like a cheaper marker would, leaving it easy to wipe off and illegible. If you like to be creative & draw, I would recommend these marker for just that! Sharpie is THE go-to permanent marker for everyday use.
