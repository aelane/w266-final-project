The website you have to go to order skins is very slow and therefore I opted not to take the time to use my own photos like I originally wanted. The website truly has many different categorities of images that can be chosen, and my personal favorite is landscapes. Their website needs some work. You simply go to the SkinIt.com website and choose the design you want. If you go to the website they tell you, you can enter the pin and obtain a free &#34;skin&#34;--a sticker to apply to the whole stapler.Trouble is, the thing is a piece of junk! I logged onto the Skinit website whose address is provided on the coupon and on the back of the packaging. Immediately, the website asked me for my Pin Code. I logged onto UPS's website and typed in the tracking number. The website will tell you it takes 3-4 days for the skin to be created before it ships to you. You have to go to the Swingline website to choose your &#34;skin&#34;, enter the code that came with the stapler & they mail the &#34;skin&#34; to you at no extra charge. Go to the website, order using the credit code and customize yours easily. Ideally, the website would give me a template with the correct resolution, etc. You just go to the website, enter the code, select your skin, fill out your email, name and address and presto, done! You go on the website and pick one you like and they will send it in the mail. You go to the website cited in the stapler packaging; you choose your product (apparently skins are offered for many different items); you select the skin design you like best (there are many choices); you place your order and receive a confirmation e-mail at the address you provided. It was very easy to go to their website, apply the unique code that came with the stapler, design my skin (or choose from one of many skins already available) and place my order. When you visit the website provided in the package [...], you enter in the code provided in the package (it is small, so don't lose it when you open it up), and you will be lead through a series of very simple instructions on how to order your custom skin. The website has a lot of pre-made designs you can chose from (and when I say a lot, I mean thousands--it actually was a bit overwhelming to look at them all). You can find on the website this same stapler, just in solid colors rather than customizable , for less than one half the cost.It can do 8 pages, sometimes.
