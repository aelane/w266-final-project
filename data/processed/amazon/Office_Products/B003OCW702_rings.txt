The no snag rings are great. I like these rings a lot, but only time will tell how they will stand, but Five Star does offer a one year warranty. When it comes to the rings - there is a sacrifice (vs sturdy metal open at one time using lever rings of binders). You can open the rings to customize and move things around.This one also has a customizable cover where you can slip something in to the front (perhaps a sparkly piece of pink paper? The rings, interestingly, are rubberized plastic, and do not work on a spring mechanism like a traditional binder. But the rings are heavy-duty and can take a lot of abuse. The rings are rubbery and somewhat crushable and it is smaller than a 1&#34; binder. I was skeptical of the rings, they seemed like they may break off really easily but not one problem yet. The plastic rings are very flexible and don't seem to want to break easily. Unsnapping the rings individually is a bit annoying, but the fact that it is virtually silent is great.

But that was because it covered the rings, which should keep them from getting snarled up with other items and bent. These rubbery rings are a little tricky to open, making it a bit difficult to add pages at will. The rings, however, don't open similar to regular metal rings. The rings are fastened by a long plastic insert on one side of the ring that slides into the plastic hole on the other side of the ring.
