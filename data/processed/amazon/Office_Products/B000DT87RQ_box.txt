The latter makes it sturdier, but when you're trying to open the box it does take a little finagling to pull them out. This also makes disassembly of the box a bit harder, as you have to pry those smashed edges back out.Good: hanging folders hang nicely in the box, and it seems sturdy enough to hold them without crushing too easily. Take them out of their main box, pull one apart and it practically starts to put itself together. The box is not so heavy that I can't lift it myself because I can lift/push straight up with my thighs, keeping the center of gravity close to my body, unlike with larger boxes. What you can open out into a box can also be folded back flat should you ever need to do that.I could not be happier with this solution to what has been a real problem for me. You punch free and fold in the box handles yourself which means if you prefer a box without holes these will work for you. The final box is amazingly sturdy for someone used to buying plastic boxes..cardbox can crumble, but these will hold strong and stack well, even filled with papers. !I had the entire box assembled in less than 30 seconds!! Nice sized box. Yes, they are easy to assemble, but I don't recall any box I've ever put together being "difficult" to put together! So each box saves 3 years worth of documents for me.As you can see in the picture, there is ample room on the front & the back to properly identify the boxes contents.I noticed older reviews stating the boxes didn't fold together well. A good box and a good buy.
