So far it's been a great machine. I used to have a dedicated FAX machine until we went all cell phone and lost the land line.The WF-2540 has normal in/out phone line connections (one cord supplied) so you can have a phone in use with it also.Easy setup using the large LCD screen on the front panel. A great all-purpose machine for a good price. I've had an HP machine there for the last several years, I put it there after my Lexmark X11 went dead. You can initiate a scan from the machine, and have the results routed to your computer automatically. You can configure the machine to send its received faxes to your computer (saves paper and ink). I am very happy with how this machine fits into my limited space. However I have to say, this machine is built light. I would expect a machine with this many features to need at least one software update, and I would not be sorry to receive a few more.Operating Costs:The big issue with inkjet printers is the cost of the ink. I have not set the machine up to fax, so can't comment on that, but I noticed that the printer driver setup on the computer gives you a separate "printer" for faxing, something that took me a minute to figure out -- I thought I was printing to the WF-2540 printer, but actually sent to the WF-2540 fax device, which, of course, didn't go anywhere.The printer shuts itself down nicely after being unused for several minutes and then is very quiet and unobtrusive. This Epson All in One is a little machine. This machine prints nicely and quickly.

If Magenta, Cyan or Yellow runs low, the machine will not allow you to print in black (even if black is full).

I tested this machine on an Apple iMac.

The machine operated reliably.
