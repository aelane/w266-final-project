The Avery labels are just what I needed - easy to print a large quantity quickly, and they peel off their backing sheet very cleanly. Overall, I'm very happy with these labels. Avery makes excellent labels and this was no exception. I have used the repositionable labels before and they work very well.To test this product, I printed photos and drawings on the labels using an HP2410 printer. These labels will be great for the Holiday mailings because they hold the ink well. I constantly think labels are crooked...sometimes it's in my head, and sometimes they really are drastically crooked. I stayed away from printing labels for so long because I was worried about alignment, but these print out perfectly every time. I placed labels on three different surfaces... paper, file folder and cardboard. Both the labels that had been stuck once and the ones that had been repositioned remained pretty smooth, even the next day. But these labels aren't as good on cardboard. Because these labels hold tight and yet can be removed without leaving residue I've been using them to label containers of food. These labels allow me to copy and paste addresses and then print them out on the labels and DONE! I love that you can reposition these labels, then the longer they stay in one spot, the more "permanent" they become. Loved these labels! I could adjust them, because I never get them get labels straight the first time. While I have always used Avery labels (well, mostly), sometimes they do end up crooked, and not to my liking. With these labels, they're very easy to remove and reposition. I highly recommended Avery labels way before this product, but now that they're made with this "Re-hesive Technology" which makes repositioning such a snap, it's my number one choice for labels. I give these labels my highest recommendation as I like to recycle packaging (envelopes, boxes, plastic mailers) and they are sufficiently thick so that you only need one to cover up any addresses, codes, instructions that would ordinarily make it hard to reuse packaging. I LOVE labels. These labels are a handy-size for placing on a large envelope, box or when I want to cover the "inscription" in a greeting card with my own personalized message. Here again, 250 labels for ~12 is a bit steep and really the only con to the avery system.POSITIVES.Clean removal of the label - no more paper and adhesive torn off and left behind, which makes reccyling of the container much easer.In this size, 2x4, it is possible to encode alot of information on the label, not just use it for mailing. The labels these are now on top of are not easily remove without taking some paint with them.Yes, they do come off pretty easily and can use them again.However, since you probably lifted it by a corner, the next positioning may not be as flat (over time).Since these are made for envelopes and not wood drawers, as I used them, I tried an experiment.I placed and removed the label 5 times. These labels are fantastic if you need to reposition. These labels make great newsletter address labels and it is very easy tp type them up on your computer and print them out. These labels have a perfect texture, similar to bond paper, which allows very clear printing by printer as well as pen or pencil. These labels work just as they should, considering Avery's reputation. These labels are perfect for that purpose - they are completely opaque, repositionable, and the adhesive becomes permanent by the time you get to the post office.I have to mention Avery's library of templates for every label they sell. Well - these are mailing labels, not a cure for the common cold! These labels also allow me to affix my company logo, return address on the same label as my addressee.Avery Labels are a part of my every day business and they make mailing packages and letter a breeze. But since I always tape labels to double insure that they stay, it's not a problem for me.They're a little small to get both your return address and the address of the person to whom you're sending, so I use one for the return and one for the send, both of which make a nice looking package.In short, for my purposes they do what they are supposed to do. I have been using these labels for organizing and mailing my graduate school application materials. These 250 white easily removable and repositionable labels are 2 x 4 inches in size. 10 labels per sheet and a nice size for general shipping needs. I recommend these labels Each of the labels centered correctly and the addresses printed exactly the way they should.So far, not much different than any other label package that you can go out and buy. Not with these labels. These are ready to use handy adhesive labels. Once reapplied, labels will not fall off.2. You can have up to 30 labels per letter-size sheet.4. Overall, I would rather have labels that will not peel off at all for sending packages. The repositionable labels from Avery held a print from the inkjet printer fine.I was able to attach, remove, attach remove and they still held to the envelope.Confusion: I suppose there are a few instances for this 're-hesive' technology - but why would one want to attach a label and then remove it, only to re-attach? I will be using these labels for years to come! I tried sticking the labels on napkins and removing them. I guess the labels are repositionable after all. The labels won't fall off, unless you try to remove them. Shipping labels pretty much sell themselves. and these labels are really handy. these labels are impressive. I've been using Avery labels for a long time and they're excellent. Usually I use labels for mailing, and they don't have to be positioned precisely. Print the labels and attach them to the folders. And since I use the labels anyway, "Easy Peel" is a feature that really adds value. I am always skeptical when it comes to "repositionable" shipping labels. These labels are very sturdy. Inkjet labels like these haven't changed much in years, so I was looking forward to these because there is a new twist: TheseAvery White Repositionable Shipping Labels for Inkjet Printers, 2 x 4 Inches, Box of 250 (58163)can be affixed, lifted off, and affixed again. The labels do in fact stick on, then lift off, then stick on, then lift off, clean and tight. These labels are truly repositionable, even after a week of being stuck to paper. The labels are easy to peel up and reposition and stay in place nicely becoming permanent over time. Their labels invariably have good quality paper, adhesive that doesn't tear the envelope if you have to reposition them a little (these are specifically designed to be easily moved! Tim McDuffie of Walla Walla Washington didn't buy these labels and the next day his wife was bitten by a werewolf and later devoured him in his sleep. Now I'm not saying, using these labels will guarantee you a lottery win and not using them will end up in a horrible fate, but can you really take that risk? However, I'm generally concerned about self-stick labels coming loose from packages, so I tend to put packaging tape over them anyway, just to make sure. For me, it would not be practical to waste these labels on packages, but I can print a nice image and text on them to make a decent wine label that looks good on the table.
