So I decided to check out these "improved" boxes. They take a bit longer to put together than the standard boxes, and you must make sure you fold the tiny flap on the window side before doing the rest. The boxes also have a decorative pattern that some may prefer. And, best of all, two small boxes stacked on top of each other fit my standard Sauder shelves with almost no wasted space. The boxes look stylish and can be used to store things out in the open without looking crummy. These boxes go together easily and are sturdy once together. Both the boxes I received will come in very handy - we can never have too many storage boxes in our house. These are cardboard boxes with a design on the outside.For 11 dollars and some change, I expected at least plastic. The boxes themselves are sturdy but cardboard deteriorates SO quickly and can be destroyed SO easily. I recved these from the Vine Program.I wasn't sure what to expect before these boxes arrived... What I discovered was how easy it was to put them together and how strong they are. I didn't realize how big these boxes were until I receive them in the mail. The boxes come with plastic hand holds that fit into the sides of the box for easy lifting.I was happy to find that dvd's fit perfectly into the box. These boxes are really sturdy and I love the design. These boxes are perfect! I think these are great boxes, and they were exactly what I was looking for to store odds and ends in an organized fashion.Added 12/29/11: I ordered the underthebed version, and they are perfect! The boxes fit fine into a standard storage cubby.I definitely wouldn't pay $5 apiece for these (Amazon has them listed for over $11 for a set of 2)--especially when you can get a nice canvas, plastic or basket bin for about the same price or a little more. These boxes are sturdy but not really worth the price (they are just cardboard boxes, after all). The boxes are easy to assemble, but I wish that Bankers Box would have a tighter spec on the dimensions, since when folded, the box does not fit together perfectly and is not fully square (I also noticed this on the larger boxes with front plastic windows that I received previously). I really like these boxes. I use these boxes to store notebooks and folders and worldbooks for an RPG game my husband and I play. It's very simple to put together these boxes or to fold them flat when not in use. Do note the boxes are  9.9"x10.1"x9" so not too big but not to small either. Very easily assembled, the boxes are triple reinforced so they stand up to heavy loads. Easy to assembleThese boxes are very easy to assemble. The boxes can be put together in minutes. The boxes do seem pretty sturdy. Time will tell as to how the boxes hold up as they are ultimately just fancy cardboard boxes. I was surprised at how MUCH I liked these simple boxes. I was initially worried that these boxes would be too big to fit under my bed (which is already pretty tall.) These "small" boxes are not shoe-box size--they have substantial size. These boxes are good for storing items for a year or two in a climate controlled area (like inside your house)but really are not a good long term solution. These boxes are great for storage on closet  shelves or even  out where they will be seen. I like these boxes very much. The boxes are roomy and strong. Even worse when I tried to move the boxes, even though I was not holding them by the handle, they came apart. These boxes really struck me for how sturdy they feel. I'm finally going through old boxes of mixed contents, throwing some items out, and organizing the remainder in more sensible  collections. These boxes are very sturdy, and large enough to hold a good amount of stuff (I could fit a whole bed linen set, incudining the comforter, in it rather easily) without being so large they're cumbersome. I have the 2-pack of gray boxes. Then I saw these boxes and thought they would be perfect.The boxes are easy to assemble and seem quite sturdy. They are reinforced and make the boxes easy to move about, but they do leave an entrance for dust and creepy-crawlies. I'm assembly handicapped so if I could assemble these boxes in minutes flat practically anyone could!+ Lightweight and sturdy construction.+ Stackable and stores easily in closets and under most beds.+ Plastic handle inserts are strong, easy to insert and protect against cardboard cuts.+ Transparent plastic insert slides into the boxes side window so you can easily view the contents inside.+ Stylish and timeless black and white filigree pattern.Cons- Handles still leave holes that will allow dust and dirt to settle inside the box and on its contents.- Cardboard will eventually dent and wear over time.- A bit too expensive for what you get.- Shipped in an unnecessarily large cardboard Amazon box. These boxes are pretty useful and the design is tasteful and gender neutral. These boxes are really nice, very sturdy, and the window makes them great for storing a variety of thing. We received this with the four boxes needing assembly. They are handy boxes for holding your stationery, clothes, and other miscellaneous items.Pros- Bins fit "standard" storage cube shelving- Fairly Sturdy. If you need boxes for your storage cubes shelvings, these are definitely well worth considering. Because these four boxes taken together hold less than a tenth of a cubic yard, I do not recommend them for disposing of a week's worth of yard waste or for storing even a day's worth of giraffe feed unless you have one of those pygmy giraffes.The boxes are as sturdy as you could expect from cardboard, and the two plastic handles make moving them easy, even if the boxes are packed tight against the two ends where the handle openings are. These boxes were easy to put together, and the plastic handle inserts add a nice level of sturdiness. These boxes are very easy to assemble; it took me only a minute to put together one. I really like these boxes. My 2-pack of boxes arrived inside a cardboard shipping box that was inside a HUGE shipping box filled with paper. These are sturdy boxes that will hold up for years and they are well worth the money. The boxes, not so easy. You just have to be sure that when you snap them together, make sure they are tight.If you are able to find plastic boxes for the same price, or even a few dollars more, I would recommend upgrading to that option. I am not particular mechanically inclined, so I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to put these boxes together - lids, handles, windows and all in a few minutes each, without looking at the directions. Personally I probably prefer plastic boxes since the whole box is see through and waterproof. But if you need boxes for occasional use, like going back and forth to college, these boxes may be be a nice choice because you can assemble them when you need them for moving and lay them flat when they are not in use. These boxes are easy to put together except for the window pane on the side. The boxes are small, 6"H x 15"W x 12"D, but I found them to hold quite a lot of files and paperwork and the size is great to store in a smaller space and/or in my case, a great size for a senior gal to move about when filled to the brim! The boxes are easy to fold and put together and they are fairly sturdy. I think we will be using these boxes even after the remodeling has been completed. I like the boxes and they were easy to assemble. The boxes themselves are working out fine, just stored in our closet instead. The boxes include a black plastic piece which acts as a handle. The boxes are quite sturdy, and I loaded one up with somewhat heavy electronic equipment.In terms of negatives, the boxes are a bit pricey for cardboard storage containers.
