This paper was not really of the high quality standards I have come to expect from Mead products in the past. This paper is unbelievably cheap,  bought it for standard school supplies. The paper is thin but it has never torn. As long as you are going to use paper, you might as well be responsible.I have atrocious handwriting. The TOPS paper is ***full size*** which is a big deal to me. The paper weight is about equal to the Mead Filler Paper. This paper has a very fine grain with a smooth finish that is friendly to most any writing instrument. Makes great paper airplanes, too. There's not much to say except this Mead paper is a useful product. I use Mead lined paper for my students so they can write notes and essays with ease. As some have said this paper is a touch on the cheap side, it's the sort of stuff you'd probably just use for taking class notes which would be transcribed later if you intended to keep them. However, I find the paper to be thinner than expected which may be an issue for those who exert significant pressure when they write or those who rely on their trusty eraser to get them through the day.
