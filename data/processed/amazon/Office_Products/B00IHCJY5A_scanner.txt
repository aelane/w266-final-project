The Epson WorkForce Document scanner is ideal for those going from a paper-based to a  PDF-based world. This scanner is very versatile (I think), hence the elaborate configuration it needs. If you're marketing an expensive scanner like this, your customer almost surely wants it to deliver everything it's advertised to do (wireless scanning) and to do it with tools that make the usage very intuitive and handy (good software package). This Epson Work Force scanner came with impressive specs, so I was happy to try it out at home.Because it has a relatively small footprint for such a high speed scanner, I was able to keep it on my regular computer desk, which allowed me to use the included USB cable during set up. And because the scanner takes up so little space, especially with the fold out trays stored, I can keep this ready to run so I never have to store another piece of paper again.The software offers lots of flexibility in how you store the files and what information to include, and I really like that it allows me to choose my Epson flatbed scanner up front if I have a job that won't fit through the feeder of this scanner. As long as don't expect to use this scanner wirelessly, you will be generally satisfied with this scanner.The form factor is great. It is a really fast scanner and it does indeed scan front and back sides of documents simultaneously, even a stack of double sided documents. The scanner software comprehends that I have a total of three Epson scanners and I can choose which one I want to use.Here are a few things it couldn't do or do well. The scanner got confused when it went past the legal paper size and stopped saying there was a paper jam. I tested the scanner using a Win 8.1 PC. It was easy to get the scanner set up and going through the USB connection. It definitely is not user friendly getting this scanner going on WiFi.The unit produced very good quality scans and worked very well overall. You cannot simply switch from USB to Wifi and back again, but must re-install the scanner driver and select the interface. Epic fail.This DS-560 scanner is the sibling of the DS-510 scanner that I reviewed in January. When used via Wifi, the scanner is not listed as an available scanner by the OS X Image Capture app, or the system preferences. It will be agonizing to go back to a flatbed scanner for the pix that I will have to do there. You also need the EpsonNet Config app to introduce your scanner to your wireless network AP.It took me nearly half an hour to work through the details, and I can imagine a novice tearing their hair out trying to sort this all out.As for scanning: the Document Capture app is the daily "go to". The scanner by definition is now in a one-to-many relation with possible users on the network.) It is far easier to use this scanner than to use the one in my printer -- especially if you have a lot of documents to scan. Highlight DS-560 scanner and click configuration on the top. Turn the scanner off and slide the connection switch on the back to extreme right Wi-Fi.7. Power the scanner back on and a solid white light indicates that scanner has a successful connection to your Wi-Fi network.8. If you do not see the scanner, make sure the scanner is on with solid white light and hit refresh. Even after the scanner is connected to your network, you cannot just press the scan button on the scanner and have the document show up on the computer. Brother Wi-Fi scanner setup and cloud setup is breeze in comparison.Brother ADS1500W Compact Color Desktop Scanner with Duplex and Web ConnectivityandBrother Printer ADS2500W Document Scannerare the other two Wi-Fi scanners in this range, the later high speed and lot more expensive than Epson DS-560, as of now. Equally difficult installing the scanner on my Mac Mini. I wanted to place the scanner near the counter where I come in from outside and empty my pockets, and immediately scan all my receipts from the entire day. I would've likely returned this scanner to the store had it been an outright purchase and not a Beta-test.10. I do this but the scanner won't connect (I'm in the setup software following the prompts). Don't start with the scanner:  start with the device (router) that has the information the scanner needs.2) If your router allows you to disable WPS (mine did by default), you must enable it. The scanner pulls in the receipt and crumples it into a minute accordion. I make sure the scanner's indicator light says that it's connected. Save the extra $ to get a Fujitsu or don't buy a scanner at all. This scanner is a lot cheaper than its main competitor but the software is not as polished but once it is all set up - does a great job.

I may yet do that, as I do expect to use the scanner within a few feet of a PC.Apart from my learning curve, this is a very fast and powerful scanner.

We have also since tested this scanner successfully via a WiFi link to my son's fully-updated Mac.

Overall, at approximately $370 for the scanner, the software felt more budget.I think your purchase of this would really depend on the number of scans per day and how detailed those scans need to be.
