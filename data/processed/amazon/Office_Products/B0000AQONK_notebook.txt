It's not an everyday notebook, but if you're in weekly meetings, it's a good for note-taking in those. This is a great notebook for lists or plans, with a nice wide side margin for those inevitable modifications or clarifying notes that always crop up. However, I do need a single notebook to have with me in meetings and to help me organize and prioritize. I LOVE this notebook because it's so roomy - you can use it as a journal, or to do list. I was kinda disappointed that Mead chose to make this notebook wide-ruled. Apart from that, this would otherwise be an excellent notebook. This is a fine notebook. This notebook is flexible enough to accommodate any strategy, but mine is quite simple.Each page is dedicated to a specific category of tasks (e.g. He likes keeping this notebook in his briefcase and it is always super easy for him to make notes. Having this notebook with it's formatted pages makes this specific to my &#34;action items.&#34;  Now I have them all in one place and it's helping keep this someone disorganized and over-committed workaholic organized and somewhat on track! The notebook is wonderful. I use this notebook as a planner, and it works perfectly in that role. Also, this notebook looks EXACTLY like other styles of Cambridge Limited notebooks (like ones with just plain lines or the meeting planner, or whatever) so having a few different ones is confusing if you don't mark them somehow.Still, I kind of want to collect them all. This is a great notebook in many ways.It's full-size, spiral-bound, made of 20-pound paper, and has a flexible but durable cover. It would be a great, &#34;survivable&#34; notebook, one that could take abuse in a backpack or briefcase.It's best feature is the 2  inch wide left margin. The notebook is 80 pages, and it costs about $5.25 here on Amazon today. It does look a little more professional, but no more useful than a simple notebook you could pick up anywhere. the notebook is sturdy and efficiently organized. I like this notebook as the blank piece on the left side lets me make notes for action items. This notebook has a large open column on the left for jotting down ideas or thought clouds, while the right side features 28 lines for taking notes on.This is an extremely versatile notebook and is great for attending meetings or interviews. This notebook has the line down the page, with a blank space on the left and a larger lined section on the right. I'm very happy with this notebook. It's not really the usual notebook a student would take to class (although one could), but rather a planner or task notebook. Overall, though, a great notebook for planning or task-tracking. I have been using this notebook as my &#34;brain dump&#34; location for the past week, and for the most part it's pretty great. This is a well thought out notebook, offering a good deal of flexibility to the note taker.

This is a well made notebook with solid paper.

This notebook has two lines at the top with spaces for the date and the &#8220;page.&#8221;  Oddly, the 160 pages (if you count both sides) don&#8217;t have preprinted numbers.

This notebook's greatest strength is its versatility, as well as its canny layout, which maximizes both creative potential and organizational clarity.
