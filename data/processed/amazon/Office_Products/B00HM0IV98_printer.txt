The printer has a good driver and software suite that will handle everything from scanning to .pdf files to printing photos, although this isn't a spectacular photo printer. I recommend this printer as an affordable option for those looking for a home printer. It is however a very solidly built and generally very reliable printer. **** Connectivity ****A Wi-Fi printer connection nowadays seems like a must, and most printers that I've come across in recent years seem to have it as a standard option. This printer easily found my home network. Having had a Canon printer in the past that was very similar to this one, I knew what to expect. This is a perfect printer if you don't need duplex printing and are not a heavy user of printers. This printer does everything pretty well (I didn't / couldn't test the fax though) but nothing exceptionally well. This printer is really aimed for the home office user, I wouldn't put it into a small business where it's going to get a lot of use. As long as you set this printer up in a different place from your router (like your neighbor's house, perhaps?) Any printer can do this. The printer does what it is supposed to do. I got this printer for my brother who is in college and who needs a decent printer to to light printing, scanning, and copying. Ultimately, I managed stop the printer from looping, then choose an access point and entered the wireless encryption code manually. Without asking me it made this printer the "default" printer, and 2. Instead the printer has a multi-purpose feeder that holds 40-50 sheets of paper. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this printer. My old printer was forever jamming when printing envelopes or the text never lined up right. I originally thought this printer was supposed to duplex and print on both sides but I have reread the product listing and see I was wrong but I have been comparing a lot of printers. This is my third Canon printer and they have all been great. Google Cloud Print lets you print to your printer from anywhere. You basically register the printer with Google. After all, this is essentially the same printer, but with slightly improved features.Overall, it's easy to recommend this printer. Canon took a good little printer and made it even better, while keeping the price reasonable. The printer is compatible with OS or Windows (even the latest Windows 8).It uses the same cartridges used by MX522 and MX532. My last printer needed four cartridges one for each color. This Cannon printer is perfect for my needs and I highly recommend it. I recently acquired a Canon MX472 printer, scanner, copier and fax machine. I wanted to upgrade from my previous Canon MP470 printer, which is just a printer/scanner/copier.The setup of this printer was very easy. Since I own a Mac I had to go online to set up the printer because the setup disc that came with the printer is Windows only. I chose to use my printer wirelessly and that setup was equally as easy. To refill the printer with all large capacity cartridges (about 600 pages of ink) costs as much as a new printer with 200 pages of ink included. And, it is LOUD!That being said, it is a great printer for regular type printing.T
