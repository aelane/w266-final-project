They are bright, write fluidly and pleasantly, and have no odor that I could detect. These also erase easily and don't have an excessive odor. Thankfully, these are low odor. * No bothersome odor at all. There is a yucky odor, but that's how fat tip dry erase markers are. Not worse than the odor from standard dry erase markers, just more like alcohol. These are the first &#34;low odor&#34; markers that actually seemed to have a less than obnoxious smell. I really like that they have little or no odor at all. There is little to no odor that I can perceive and I feel comfortable letting my children play with them, which they do for hours. They are low odor and keep their chisel tip shape.

Expo low odor markers are stronger scented than these.

They are also easily erasable.These do have an odor, but not too much and it fades quickly.

It may very well have less odor, but it has a different odor that I think is worse - it smells like those really strong "magic markers" that were around in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s.
