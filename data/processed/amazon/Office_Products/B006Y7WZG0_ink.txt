They seem small, but I may just not realize how little ink it really takes to print. The ink is great so far, but I am worried that, since this printer is an inkjet, it may run out quickly. Installing the ink and setting up the hardware was quick and painless. It used ink frivolously, but everything printed superbly. The ink is not cheap by any means, and it definitely is HUGE. The ink is where it gets costly. There are 4 ink cartridges unlike the 6 inks for the Artisan 1430. It has four ink cartridges that use minimal amounts of ink and only uses ink that is relevant to the project you're printing. I haven't used up too much of the ink yet, so the next step is seeing how much this beast drinks!The printer is pretty big though, but it doesn't feel like any of that space is wasted. Between the ink initialization, the extremely long driver installation, setting up the wi-fi, and then installing the printer's new firmware, the whole process took about 40 minutes. The ink cartridges, of which it has 6 (including high capacity black), are somewhat on the small side. I love that the ink colors are individually tanked so that if one runs out I don't have to lose the remains of the rest in order to restore full color (a complaint from my old machines).
