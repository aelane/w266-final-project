Most of pens come in pairs - there's probably only 34 different colors. You also have to set it up yourself - the pens come in a bag. There are multiple pens of the same color with wide or narrower tips as well. I feel the pens are high enough quality that they remind me a little bit of my Pilot Gel point pens that I prefer for work. 68 pens of varying colors plus a nice stand to see what you do have. With 68 pens, I doubt I'll ever use them all up! The pens came in two bags and, because I like things to be in order, I spent almost 30 minutes organizing the pens by color in the stand. Because the many many pens in my house disappear so often, I like the idea of a stand for the pens so they'll stay in one place and I can easily see if anything goes missing. Tekwriter Gel pens have a wide variety of very vivid colors. These pens offer great coverage with no gunked up tips or dry tips. I've tried these pens on a variety of papers and they do not bleed through! The pens write smoothly and evenly without skipping as some gel pens do. "Includes 8 basic pens (0.7 mm), 8 pastel pens (0.8 mm), 6 neon pens (0.8 mm), 17 metallic pens (0.8 mm), and 29 glitter pens (1.0 mm"It seems there are duplicates of many of the colors since I can't tell them apart. But enough about me here's a bit more on the pens. There are 68 pens total, with several being of duplicate color. Because they are gel pens they glide easily when writing, dry quickly and I didn't have a problem with smearing. I cannot recommend these pens enough. I found the pens to write quite nicely. As I have had two pens leak all their ink out, I am deducting another star. Since then, I have thrown away about 10 pens because they leaked. The pens are stored in the holder and are in the house, so it is not like they are getting overheated or frozen and thawed again. Actually, there's basically 34 pens (some with glitter) twice.Loads of beautiful colors, but don't be confused, there isn't 68 different shades.The stand it okay, standard issue black plastic. These are such wonderful pens, just get two sets, one for you and one for the kids. If you're as addicted to color as I am you'll love these pens. These pens come with a black plastic rack to hold them all, which makes a pretty way to store them in an office or craft space. This isn't complicated - the pens have clear sides and the sparkles are visible. I love buying colored pens and I'm particular about which ones I'll use and purchase. The pens I got seemed to have 2 or 3 of the same of some colors. You have to be very intentional about putting the pens back in because they don't just drop where they should be resting. Some of the pens are glittery, some are metallic, some are regular gel color.My set came with: (Descriptions to the best of my ability)4 black pens3 silver pens3 dark gold pens1 light gold pen1 brown pen3 brownish mauve pens2 peach pens2 pinky peach pens2 coral pens2 rose pink pens2 bubblegum pink pens2 hot pink pens2 fuschia pens2 brick red pens1 brown glittery pens2 burnt orange pens2 orange pens4 dark purple pens2 purple pens1 lavender pen1 royal blue glittery pen2 royal blue pens2 forest green pens2 green pens2 rainforest green pens2 tealish pens2 light blue pens1 cerulean blue pen2 lime green pens2 spring green pens2 yellow glittery pens4 highlighter yellow pens It is adequate for holding the pens but the edges are not smoothed and it isn't quick or easy to get the pens into their spots, which matters when you're doing a lot of doodling! If you like gel pens and want a wide variety of colors, this is a fine set that's very affordable. I can't believe how many pens are included in the set: i have never seen so many gel pens together in my life! I love gel pens...except, they dry up so dang fast. That only worries me because they ARE gel pens. These pens are great for crafting and journaling - the inks are smooth, they all work well, and I love the little stand they're in. I really enjoyed working with these pens. I am somewhat confused as to whether there are supposed to be multiple pens that are the exact same shade or whether the differences are too light for me to see. There were several pens where the ink didn't flow as nicely as the others. Don't bother with more expensive pens!My kids were just thrilled with this pen set when it arrived. I was a little worried about the pens themselves, because you can often find off-brand pens that are crappy and the ink clumps or barely comes out. But not these pens! It is delivered with the pens tucked inside the stand and the stand well secured in bubble wrap to make sure it gets to you in one piece. The pens write smoothly -- I've tried ten of them, and they don't skip. The pens were separated into two bags, and they were bubble wrapped along with the stadium.The stadium is sturdy and the colors of the pens are vibrant. It is that bright and opaque.I really love the pens, and it's pretty awesome to have such a range of colors.The display is cheap, but so what? Love the pens and their easy flow vibrant ink colors. I just love seeing these colorful pens sitting in a corner of my desk waiting for me to use them! I ordered these pens for scrapbooking since they are acid-free and therefore safe on scrapbook pages. Wow; so many pens, so little time; lol! Now all the pens are out of the stand because I was trying to figure out what's metallic, what's neon, what's glitter. It's recommended to store the pens in the stand; I think so the gel doesn't dry out.Info that comes with the set states that if the pens seem dry firmly press the pen tip to the paper 3 times to re-engage the ink; so far I have not needed to do that. You have to sort the pens and put them in the holder. They are not as good as Sakura GellyRoll pens, which are still the very best, in my opinion, but expensive(!). I'm planning on storing the pens in a pencil box we already had on hand.The Grip: When you grip the pens, you can tell they are of average disposable pen quality.The Colors: They come in an assortment of colors, including "glitter," which I think is best described as shimmer.
