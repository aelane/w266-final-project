The unit has an A/C adaptor slot but does not come with an A/C adaptor.There's an included symbol list illustrating all the designs available in the machine. When Vine offered this unit I "grabbed while the grabbin' was good." Instead, I want to talk about what makes this new Epson unit better (for me at least) than any other I've used.First, a caveat: my label maker is a P-Touch that's a few years old. I was looking for a nice, moderately priced unit for some of my routine label needs, and came across this brand new LW-300 from Epson. The unit is compact, very easy to use, and actually has an internal memory allowing you to recall quickly, the colors you select each time. This is a handy unit I know I will use often ! The unit comes with all the label tapes in various colors and 6 AAA batteries to power the unit. The unit powers on instantly and is a breeze to use. Not that this Epson unit is *extremely* heavy of course, it's not a giant gold brick. I just need to label and go.Still, this is clearly a solid, functional unit, with lots of cool bells and whistles. The unit has an AC adapter available but that has to be purchased separately.
