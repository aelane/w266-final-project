This mouse pad was exactly what i needed.All black, nice square shape doesn't take up extra space on my desk and the bottom is made of extra "grippy" material which doesn't move as you use it.Also, the cushion is nice and soft and just the right height.Thank you. You won't skid, you won't get stuck, and thankfully, the mouse pad DOESN'T MOVE OR SLIDE AT ALL even with your harshest movement. The mouse pad area works fine as well. I had previously used a mouse pad with a plastic wrist support, and I prefer the cushioned but supportive feel of this wrist rest.The mouse pad itself works well, with a very smooth surface for the mouse. The mouse pad looks professional and is an adequate size - neither too small nor too large. This is probably the best mouse pad I've ever owned. If you like to move your mouse pad alot, you won't like this feature. And lastly, my mouse slides nicely on the surface of the pad.I haven't found any negatives to this product at all. It got to be annoying if I was using the mouse for a long period of time. It's just fine as a regular mouse pad. I got this mouse pad with the Gel pad because I work in the IT industry so I am on the computer all day. I've had mouse pads over the years. This is the most comfortable mouse pad that I have owned to date. With some mouse pads, this causes a little pain, but with this pad I feel pretty comfortable. OK, so a mouse pad is a mouse is a mouse pad ... right? So it doesn't slip and slide if you aggressively use your mouse (not sure why anybody would though ...)  The price is right at $11 - it is very much worth the extra $5 or $6 you would spend vs. a generic low end mouse pad. Third, the mouse itself slides over a less harsh surface, foamy the same as the padding.It also can be used for either hand. This mouse pad outgasses a bad chemical smell when first taken out of its packaging. I only wish I hadn't just recently purchased two other mouse pads with wrist rests of an inferior brand. For an everyday mouse pad that offers gentle support for your wrist, this product surpasses other ones that I have used, notably 3M varieties. The mouse pad is about 7" wide and 6.75" long. I have been using a mouse pad lately because the glide pads on my Logitech mouse deposit residue on the mousing surface, and I prefer that it not do that on my actual desk surface.Very durable: There are no obvious seams for the product to separate during use. This little mouse pad/wrist rest is the best thing I have ever tried for the space I have. The mouse pad is the typical sponge material, and the wrist pad is so very comfortable I can use it for hours. This mouse pad replaced another mouse pad similar to it, only this one feels softer and more solid. I've used 10+ mouse pads before and this one so far is the best. This mouse pad is a very comfortable alternative to a plain flat pad. My mouse seems to move smoother and faster along this pad than along the regular mouse pad I was using before; the first time I used it I almost felt like it was moving too fast, I'm not used to such effortless gliding. All in all a great mouse pad for a great price. I've always used a mouse pad with every mouse I've owned, but this one has the added benefit of a really comfortable gel wrist rest.At first, the wrist rest seemed too high for comfort, but I found that it adjusted in about a day to the way I used it (but it still seems to snap back a fair bit so it's not developing a dimple).
