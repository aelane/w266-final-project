The 3x3 cube is a good size for quick notes. This cube of sticky notes is attractive to the eye but the adhesive on the notes is not sticky enough. The big cube is also better than the traditional smaller pack of notes. The cube is made up of blue, pink, yellow, and green with a design meant to be attractive on the desktop (as opposed to varying the color with each page). This is a big cube in four bright colors.It sticks to many surfaces, my desk, my fridge, my computer...Highly recommend. I found for sorting if you gently split the cube up in to the blocks of one color each, it works very well.So I would recommend this product highly to anyone who has need of a sticky note pad. I really love the cube. There is a big cube so I won't have to hunt done more notes within a week or two. They cost about the same as a cube of Post It notes and are almost similar except for peeling off. Once I got the cube in my hand, I realize I could use them to remember everyday tasks, like a short grocery list stuck on the fridge. The Avery Stick Notes cube comes in four bright colors and the 3 x 3 notes are a good size for most tasks.

Whatever needs to be written down.I decided to take this Sticky Note cube to work, because I need it more there than at home.

The Avery cube includes bold neon colors: blue, pink, green, yellow.I tested the notes out on many different surfaces and they clung to all of them (glass, paper, fridge, glossy paper, wood) just fine, and peeled off easily.
