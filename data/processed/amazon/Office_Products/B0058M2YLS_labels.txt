These labels are perfect for the bags I use in my EBay business. These labels can also be used for a QR Code scanner app to a Smartphone. I also plan to use the labels for my church bazaar and I can print the name and address of the church on the grab bags that we sell. I would recommend these labels to any business or charity organization. You can select the labels type, and Word formats everything for you. These labels can be printed with a laser printer (feeds flawlessly in my Okidata C3200 Color Laser Printer) or inkjet printer (but didn't try).The package contains 25 sheets, each with twenty-four 1.5" square labels (that have to be printed all at the same time according to the instructions), for a total of 600 labels. The labels come 24 per page and have a gutter between each label. These square labels are perfectly represented in the wizard. The labels can be passed through a printer more than once, in order to use partial pages. These square labels are specifically marketed for QR codes and I used the online Avery templates to create my own. The labels use the "TrueBlock" technology to obliterate anything underneath. I love these labels!!! and I used Avery.com to create the labels for me! The other is to produce labels in-house that requires downloading a wizard or blank templates or pre-designed ones for Microsoft Word, Adobe software, or Apple Pages. These handy little labels are a marvel. So going from no labels to having my own custom QR coded labels was FAST and required no downloading. I liked these labels and couldn't wait to design my own holiday card seals! I liked these labels because they were billed as "print-to-the-edge", but unless the template is improved, I'm not sure how you could do that. This one like all the other labels in the Avery line has the same high quality you'd expect. These Avery labels are designed for printing QR codes, those trendy codes you can scan with your cell phone - while you can also use these labels for printing other square shaped labels. I can see going ahead and using these Avery labels to I.D. I can't say enough about how much I loved these labels! At first, I thought they were just labels. I must confess-I LOVE labels. I use labels for just about everything. The labels fed through both printers evenly, and there was no problem with the labels printing off center or askew. These labels have the "easy peel" feature, and true to advertising, I had no problem peeling the labels, and neither did my daughter, who doesn't have long nails to assist her. I stuck a few labels onto different kinds of paper (newsprint, computer paper, and a magazine) to judge how easy it would be to remove and re-position the label, and it was nearly impossible to do so without damaging the paper, label, or both.In short, these are great little labels and can be easily printed on either a laser or ink jet printer. With that said, you can rest assured that these labels will remain where you put them indefinitely. Avery is coming out with more and more labels every time I look and these are some great ones. These labels are Tru-block so if you need to paste a new QR code over top of an existing one, there will be no show-through to mess up the scan.Oh the boss is going to have fun with these.................. these labels are very professional looking for making bar codes and pricing information. These labels are a great and inexpensive way for small businesses to get their information out there. At first when I received these labels, I wasn't sure what I would use these labels for other than address labels. These labels are perfect for a large array of uses, including:*Adding your business name to products*Using QR codes for marketing*Labeling what a product is*Adding a logo*And anything else you can think of!The template available online to print labels is a valuable asset. Nice crisp white labels. These labels deserve 5 stars for performance, but only 3 stars for the label template. I was amazed at how well the labels block light transmission so that virtually nothing shows through, and they adhere to paper and plastic well. These appear to be removable labels, however. These labels are sized right, separate easily, hold ink well, and have surprising real-world durability. Avery labels are great. Avery labels are always great. These are your typical Avery labels. These  are "blackout" labels...the label is opaque enough to stop anything underneath the label from showing through. The labels are also spaced slightly apart on the sheet to allow printing to run from edge to edge. We used these Avery labels on the Valentines my kids made for school. The labels were easy to peel off the backing and they stuck well to both paper and plastic bags. The labels are also quite thick and the design on the bags did not show through. As far as labels go, these are definitely high quality - crack and peel work well to easily get the labels off, very sticky with the "Trueblock" making these completely opaque.I typically run labels through more than once as I don't always have enough to print a whole sheet at once. I noticed that these labels seemed to discolor slightly around the third time aroundMy one disappointment is that the templates available from Avery include an internal border.N
