The feet can be added and you simply stick them on, speaking of which, in time I am not sure how long the feet will hold onto the platform, but nothing super glue can't solve.Something I wanted to add was that I didn't stick down my gel wrist rest to the board as I think it will make it easier to clean than being stuck down to the board. The first is that it's not totally adjustable - you attach these sticky feet things to the backside of the platform to make it fit the height you need for comfort. Once those sticky feet things are attached, there's no moving them. "Adjustable" means you stick on some rubberized "feet" (they come in 2 different sizes) or use it flat. The feet glue onto the platform or each other. I don't see the feet for sale separately anywhere so you're pretty much stuck with your choice of height unless you want to go lower by removing them.I found the faux leather wristrest to be far too firm to the point of uncomfortable and almost causing discomfort/pain during use. I don't use the adjustable feet, I keep the platform flat. Attach the rubber feet on the bottom of the plastic tray if you want to use them. If you don't want to use the feet then you probably should just get a wrist rest only because the board would just be wasted space.You can opt to put the feet at the back of the board or the front of the board depending on how you want the keyboard tilted. Both the feet and the wrist rest attach to the platform via sticky double sided tape. I opted not to use the feet to adjust it as my keyboard has a build in tilt to it. The feet placement, once done, is permanent. The easy to stick on feet come in two sizes. I used the larger feet...which just stick on the bottom and moved my computer so that the stand is partially underneath it.
