These mailers are perfect for the holiday season and come in cute prints and sizes - a snowman, snowflakes, and Xmas lights. These are expensive, as they are only 3 mailers. The mailers are very sturdy (great for shipping photos) and convenient - I can ship gifts that are decorated/wrapped without having to wrap or decorate them myself. At first, I thought there were 6 mailers, 3 that were decorated and 3 that were plain white. I am planning to use them as 6 different mailers rather than using the plain ones to house the decorated ones. These mailers are fashionable and sturdy. These mailers are sturdy and very attractive. These mailers are super cute and I can't wait to use them this holiday season. Also, I prefer water-resistant bubble mailers...these wouldn't last long on a doorstop in rain or snow.P.S.

I love mailing/shipping so I appreciate these mailers.

These are flat mailers, so anything bulky will *not* work.

Yes, you technically get 6 mailers, but only three have the holiday prints (snowman, christmas lights, snowflakes) and the other three are the blank outer mailers.
