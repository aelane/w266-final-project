Because of the two adhesive strips, the Lay Flat Sticky Notes will not work with the Post-iT Dispenser 330. These have 2 strips so they don't curl up. Pull it ACROSS the sticky strips, so that it is a long pull, and sticky the whole way, instead of just sticky at the beginning, and at the second sticky strip (on the last third of the paper)... When I ordered these I didn't realize that they have two strips of adhesive on them and that's a terrific feature. With the double strips of glue these should lie flat. It's a simple as adding two strips of adhesive to the back instead of one. I love that these have the two strips of adhesive. Two strips of removable glue at top and bottom to ensure that the sticky notes stay flat. The Lay Flat Sticky Notes has two strips of glue on it, one at the top and one about a quarter inch from the bottom. After that, I simply tear these two strips into smaller portions. So instead of only four strips, I now have eight strips I can use to tag things!So the bottom line is: if you suffer from the dreaded curling sticky note - try these. The two strips of adhesive on the back of each note makes them stay in place.On the other hand, however, the sticky adhesive on the back of each sheet could be a bit stronger, even though there are two strips of adhesive.
