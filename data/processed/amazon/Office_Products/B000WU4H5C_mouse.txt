I have had two mouse pads that contain gel wrist rests in them and while I do like them, they can at times, feel a little too squishy. I compared it to an old 3M Gel mouse pad that I have, it it is much firmer, might as well just have a piece of wood as a matter of fact. I had the smaller mouse version of this before which I loved and when I had a chance to grab the full version, I jumped on it. It seems OK at  first, but I kept finding my mouse falling on the floor. I brought it in to work to use with my regular mouse, and it works great. My mouse and keyboard are not in a straight line  and if any is angled or slanted, this long rest naturally doesn't accomadate that. While it fit perfectly after I took out the mouse pad with wrist-rest, it was a bit too firm for me. They are trying to accomodate a mouse in addition to the keyboard which is a nice thing, but I'm not one of those users who has the mouse immediately next to my keyboard - it is several inches away and, as a result, this extra length just gets in the way of everything else that is piled on my desk.My main complaint about this wrist rest, however, is it is not wide enough. If you don't keep your mouse right next to the keyboard, that could be an issue, but otherwise not. It's really awkward to use the mouse while my wrist or forearm is resting on it, and because it's not soft it makes my hand fall asleep from resting on it too long while I'm editing pictures for hours.

If you have a mouse pad, I'd recommend using a wrist rest with attached mousepad, as they wouldn't separate as much.

It abuts my mouse pad placing my hand at a good height to use the mouse.

I typically use a wrist-rest mouse pad such as the3M Large Mouse Pad with Gel Wrist Restthat is similar to the leatherette of this keyboard rest.
