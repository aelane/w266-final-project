The pockets have a bit of stretch to them so that they hold onto things pretty well. The pockets on this are indeed rather tight, as reported by other reviewers. The pockets inside are not as wide as they look, so you can't put big things inside.For a place like the fridge, this works in either landscape or portrait. The pockets are strong enough they can hold things inside even in portrait orientation (depending on size, weight, shape, etc of objects).The magnets are pretty strong, I had one of them attached to my fridge for a month and they did not move at all when I added/removed pens/things inside of them. The pockets have a material smell to them when you put your nose to them, even 30 days after opening.If you use dry-erase boards on your fridge and always have trouble keeping the pens attached (most of the small magnetic dry erase markers are flimsy and don't last long), this is a great way to store your favorite dry erase pens.As far as sticking them to other surfaces that are not all metal (eg sides of an open-air table or book case), in my experiments, you need at least one magnet from both the top and bottom row to get a solid hold on solid metal. The pockets are big enough to hold several pens at least and a cell phone or a small notepad. There are three pockets, with one wide one for calculator sized items.I actually had occasion to wash mine in the machine, and after air drying and then pressing it flat with a book for a while it was as good as new.This is a product that should last several years, and it's a great price for what you get. The neoprene pockets insure that what is put in them stays put.Slam that door! The pockets have some give to them, but not as much as I had expected. and the pockets are roomy. The pockets are expandable, allowing you to fit thicker things inside them.Storage pouch is made with high quality material and their are 4 magnets on the back in each corner. The pockets are like cut outs so the items are held pretty securely to the pocket backing.It looks neat and is well made.Mine is currently holding a full size pair of scissors, a sharpie pen, and a external lipstick type battery pack and it's not been any problem with the storage size, or the magnets holding it up. It has two main pockets and is stretchy so room can be made if the pocket is a little small. It has pockets perfect for pens, pencils and a calculator. The pockets are made of neoprene, the strong and elastic material usually found on wet suits. Each of these pockets accommodates 2 standard size Sharpies plus a pen/pencil (3 Sharpies is doable, but very tight).The larger pocket would hold most cell phones. The pockets may loosen up over time, but then it's going to lose its sleek appearance and start to look cheap and worn.The pockets are on the small side, but it is designed for certain sized items (pens and cell phones/MP3 players). Hopefully for several years.Although it's nice and handy and the pockets stretch, it's still not going to hold much. I thought it was two large pockets.T
