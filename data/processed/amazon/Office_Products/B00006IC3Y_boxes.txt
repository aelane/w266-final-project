These boxes state in their title that they are heavy duty and after using them for a variety of items I would highly recommend them. I loaded these boxes with up to 60 pounds of books and magazines and the boxes held up well. So far so good and I don't see why these boxes won't continue to serve for a good long time. These heavy-duty boxes are very sturdy and stack easily. And if you don't need all the boxes, you can keep the unused ones flat for easy storage. Once assembled, the White/Black 0072414 boxes were difficult to take apart. Now I have four of these boxes stacked on top of each other in my living room. These boxes are the most sturdy I have ever seen in a storage or archive box. These would also make great, stackable moving boxes for heavier items such as books and papers. Whereas some other Bankers boxes have blue printing, these are totally black ink on the white cardboard. I definitely recommend these boxes. I'm very happy with these boxes. These boxes definitely are heavy duty and very suitable for long-term storage of records, in my closet. These boxes are somewhat pricey currently at $6.78 apiece plus tax, but in my opinion, they are worth the price for storage of important papers or valuable items. Most less expensive boxes don't hold up well to repeated folding and unfolding. These boxes are tough enough to overstuff. These R-Kive boxes are especially nice, not only due to the easy assembly but I like the tabs on the cover that fold into the handle openings to keep the lid in place (and also make a better handle, though even without this the handle is sturdy and comfortable.) The boxes are durable and easy to carry to the car, as well as keeping everything together once we've arrived at the destination. These boxes are perect!It literally took me 20-30 seconds to put each box together, and another 20-30 seconds to put each lid together.
