That's a great feature!I've said this on other reviews, but it still stands for the XP-800: I love the Epson Connect ability. The feature we were most excited about was the 2 sided scanning (our last printer could print 2 sided but not scan).It's been working great so far; all the features work as advertised and the print quality is good. A must have feature. The feature that clearly sets this Epson printer apart from over similar units is the photo printing quality. Outside of Epson I simply haven't seen such a feature in printers nor all-in-one machines of this level of image quality, especially on auto 2-sided print jobs. HP offers a similar feature, on a workforce caliber machine at double or triple the upfront purchase cost but the image quality just isn't the same in my book.If you are seeking a photo quality double sided printer that can also scan, copy and most importantly fax up to 30 page batches at a time, the Epson XP-800 is currently the machine of choice.5 stars in every category. The XP-800 also has an auto-duplexing feature which is very handy, but adds a bit of bulk to the printer. It's a nice feature to have but I don't plan on using it. It's easy to do and not a feature I'll be relying heavily on. Another feature, which I have not personally tried yet, is the ability to print from mobile devices.The display screen for printer control is very nice. It is fairly compact which was also a feature I was seeking. Another feature I've not used before and I would continue to forget to open the darn thing but yay it does it for me.7. It truly has every feature possible including Espon Connect with remote printing.

The Epson Connect feature allows you or those you authorize to send documents, scans and photos directly to your printer from anywhere in the world you can access email.

I checked this feature thoroughly when I tried out the Workforce, even emailing things home during my trip to the UK in early December.

This is still a great feature as the paper is stored inside the printer and doesn't jut out.
