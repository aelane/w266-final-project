I'd buy it to repair my books. I can't afford to replace some of my favorite books that have been read so much that they're practically falling apart. She brings 2-3 books to her preschool everyday and i worry about what condition they will come back in. it doesn't instantly adhere to the books so if you mess up putting it on, its easy to pull back and adjust. So I keep repairing these old books. Whether you're planning on reselling the books or not, you want to keep them in good shape.I've also used this tape to reinforce the corners and covers of my heaviest gaming books. The books have held together even with students repeatedly reading them. Crafting books.) This is much more versatile than just repairing books. We have used it on books and magazines, but have saw you can use it on record album jackets, pamphlets and more. We have patched up 20-yr old books as well as bound piano music sheets. Use on books, magazines, pamphlets, record album jackets and more. It worked very well at stablizing, holding and protecting my worn books. If you need to bind and/or protect your books, look no further as this is easily one of the best if not the best book tape. I set up my old books and with the help of my wife cut each section at a set length and then simply applied it to the binding. Now I can look at these old books without the covers falling off. For used books that I purchase that turn out to have a crease I find that this tape helps reinforce the spine so that it doesn't fall open to the crease, causing pages to fall out. For old, fragile books it provide some structural integrity it otherwise would lack.I've been using this tape for nearly a decade now and I've not detected any decay over that period of time. I make my own books and repair old books. It's designed, obviously, for repairing books, but I can find a lot more uses for it than that.
