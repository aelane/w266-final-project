I stapled through 65 sheets (130 pages) with ease. 65 sheets one handed? I took 65 sheets of ordinary printer paper and tried it out repeatedly, and it worked. Be aware that when stapling fewer than about 20 sheets the staple will pop back through the front side. I was not quite as successful attempting to staple through 65 sheets however. I went thru all 32 sheets like nothing, so I don't foresee any problems whatsoever if I ever find the need to test the 65 sheet advertized capacity.The next thing I tried this on was just two papers. They broke easily with between 2-5 sheets, but with six sheets it worked like a charm. It is advertised to staple 65 sheets at once, and it does. The PaperPro 1210 Professional 65 Sheet Stapler works as advertised: (1) it readily staples through 65 (or more) sheets of paper and (2) it requires relatively little effort on the part of the user to do so.To test the PaperPro, I counted out 33 sheets of paper, folded it over, and was able to effortlessly staple right through all 66 sheets with the PaperPro. Wow.I then proceeded with stapling through 2 sheets, then 3 sheets, ... then 6 sheets of paper and discovered to my dismay that the staples break off at the bend after stapling through 2 - 5 sheets of paper -- a rather odd problem. It will staple through 65 or more sheets of paper with ease. For 65-70 sheets the staple end tips angle up, but it holds. So we could say it does 70 sheets of 20#, but for a solid non-iffy stapling, it's 65 sheets.- It staples 19-60 PAGES of 24# paper (a common INK JET, LASER paper weight) WITH 3/8" STAPLES. For 60-65 sheets the staple end tips angle up, but it holds. So we could say it does 65 sheets of 24#, but for a solid non-iffy stapling, it's 60 sheets.Testing with 5/16" (standard) staples:- It staples 11-16 PAGES of 20# paper (common COPY paper weight) WITH 5/16" STAPLES correctly. We have been using it to routinely staple 50 plus sheets of scrap paper together into scrap paper "notebooks". It also easily stapled through 30 sheets of card stock for a school project.Refills of 3000 high capacity staples are currently available on Amazon for under five dollars. It does what it says it does...staple 65 +- sheets of paper.
