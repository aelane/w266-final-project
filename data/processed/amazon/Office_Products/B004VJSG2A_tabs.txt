These little tabs are surprisingly sticky for their small size. They aren't as solid as the tabs, but for temporary use they are really handy. They also make great permanent tabs for studying. Post-it tabs are all on one clear plastic holder, Avery's are separate, like little notes. I have moved the tabs around and they have retained their "stickiness" despite being applied and re-applied. You can reuse one of these tabs over and over, too. Avery Page Markers/ colored organizing tabs are an excellent product. No more serrated edged tabs falling out here and there. I LOVE these tabs. these tabs are functional and get the job done. The tabs adhere easily to the page but are easily removable and makes no mark. You can also write on the tabs.
