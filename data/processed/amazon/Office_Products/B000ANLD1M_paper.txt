If you prefer to have a paper receipt and a label, then you are better buying LABEL,SHPG,W/RECPT,25,WHT. Not perfect but better than cutting regular paper and taping it on!Also, they do cover up previous labels, but I try and remove the previous labels anyway (when reusing the shippers), just in case. I must then cut the paper down to the size of the label, and then put 3 or 4 big pieces of shipping tape over the label. Before I would print on regular paper and tape it on the package. The thin paper receipt is easier to deal with than a second sticker with the receipt printed on it. Once you use these, it's hard going back to printing on regular 8x11 paper, cutting it yourself, and putting glue or tape over it. I usually ship with plain paper and spray adhesive. Also, you have to orient the paper correctly in your printer or it prints on the wrong half or the wrong side. The paper has a good matte finish which allows the ink to dry quickly. From taping paper on a box, cutting full-page labels in half, to now purchasing half-page labels.Since I re-use boxes, I make a habit of scribbling out all previous label info with a sharpie pen prior to affixing the new label. The solid white paper thick, strong, and opaque which successfully blanks out and covers any old labels found on shipping boxes I may wish to reuse.

This wastes paper, wastes tape (which is expensive), and took much more time.

They are printed on paper that is tined on the adhesive side so that anything on your shipping box does not show through the white label when adhered.

The paper is a little heavier than some labels, but should feed through a printer easily without getting stuck.The labels have slightly rounded corners so the backing is easily removed.
