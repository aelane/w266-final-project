The size of this one left me feeling a bit constrained, but it's less of a bother after I got more used to this mouse pad.Overall, it's an attractive little mousepad that would be perfect if it was a little larger. The over all size of the pad is not as large as the one I had that it's replacing, but I have found this actually works better. It is the perfect size; small footprint but big enough that I can move around my entire screen (15 inch screen without a problem). It seems like it will.I don't find the size of the pad too small. Depending on the size of your hand the length of the pad may be a little too short. It is the perfect size overall as I can keep my wrist stationary on the pad and move my mouse around my entire computer screen without having to slip off the edge or carry it back to the other side. The small size enhances portability, a plus for me as I move my laptop about often yet need a wrist pad too.The center placement of the pad, which is soft but firm, stays warm to the touch, while being slightly more supportive, being a little higher than the previous one I've used. If they make this in a larger size, I'd buy it and give it five stars. However, I think the size was perfect. Very comfortable, good size, compact, but not too small. It's certainly useable, and now that I'm used to its size, I'm fine with it.Overall - after using this pad for a few weeks, my middle finger doesn't seem to be locking up as much as it had been, and I haven't had any tingling in my fingers.
