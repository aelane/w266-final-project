The other three sections, separated with perforation are 3x2 inch rectangles. You can tear off sections to make it shorter; in any increment of 7-1/2", 5-1/2", 3-1/2", or 1-1/2".I tried writing with ball point pen, sharpie pen, highlighter pen, and pencil. Three of the four sections are clear rectangles and one is a narrow rectangle with the paper tab at the top. You can also separate the perforated sections and stick them other places on the page or use them separately elsewhere.These NoteTabs appear to have a limited use. However, the see-through sections should be written on with a marker because it's hard to write on them with a pen. I found these sections to be good for highlighting over an area of a book with a highlighter. You can then remove the NoteTabs without leaving any residue and reuse them if you didn't write on them or highlight over them.Other than highlighting over sections of text or using the top portion with the tab to act like binder dividers in a book, I honestly see no useful purpose for these NoteTabs. I ended up tearing the other three sections off (all 4 sections were really too long for the books I was using them with). You could highlight sections, leave notes, or just let them know something special without putting ink to the paper -- a life saver if you misspelled a word in the message or changed your mind about content, just peel off another sheet and start again. You can peel the plastic sections off the page and in the short term it doesn't lift the printing underneath, but I have no idea what it would be like trying to pull these off after a month or even a year.I can't recommend this product because I can't make an argument for its use other than to make a quick tab on something. It has perforated sections so that you can adapt the overall length to particular applications. The other three sections below the tabbed section are 2" x 3" each, making the overall length 7.5". It is also perforated, so you can tear off sections of the sticky piece to make it the size you need.
