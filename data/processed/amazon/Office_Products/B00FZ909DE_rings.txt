The rings operate quite smoothly and close securely without annoying overlaps like some binders have. I also like that when the rings are open you KNOW that they are open, and that when they are closed you KNOW that they are going to stay that way. I love the big rings which make it very easy to view, turn, and switch pages. So often the rings are cheaply made and if you fill the binder full of paper the rings get bent or the levers that pop the rings open bend or grind themselves to oblivion,This binder's weakness is the cover. The rings are large and very accommodating and sturdy. The D rings on the inside are strong and difficult to open (by design... What good is a binder that doesn't bind anything), but very easy to close. So far the rings are holding up. Will update if rings become a problem. The big D rings are secure and don't warp even with thick filling, and the entire notebook lays flat so that it's easy to replace sections as they are updated or changed. I guess if they describing the rings inside then I guess it could be heavy duty. The rings are very rigid which is good. However, when close, the rings claps really fiercely, so just be careful. The rings in this particular binder are not round; they are shaped like a &#34;D&#34; which, according to the manufacturer, allows you to store more paper than a round ring binder. The D rings give it an extra large capacity. The rings are not all circular. It also has the wonderful D rings with the dimple to hollow closure. I think placing the  rings on the back cover probably causes less stress than placing them on the spine.The ten colors are very nice and you can customize them further by placing labels in the spine or front cover overlays. The "D" rings work very smoothly . To be fair, the D-shaped rings on the binder are sturdy with the capacity to hold up to 660 sheets of paper.

The rings open without having to push on the &#8220;flip&#8221; tabs on either end of the mechanism.The cover and the edge of the binder have a one-sided open pocket so you can name your binder on the edge and display an 8&#8221; x 11.5&#8221; piece of paper on the front.

The D rings are fine, and the binder does appear to hold as many sheets as would be expected.

Opening & closing the rings are fine; however, the plastic cover feels flimsy, and it is bubbled up over whatever material it is covering.
