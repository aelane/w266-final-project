It has always seemed to me like a great printer for home, but not really one meant for the office. I love our printer and we have now had it for 2 years and it is going strong. This is a great printer for home use! If my printer breaks, I intend on buying the newer version of the same printer I have--the 6310. This was not it.This is my second go around with this specific printer. If the printer were to have burst into flames and melted down to the very core of the planet I would not have been the least suprised.Anyhow, I have thrown it in the trash. )Scanner, printer, and fax all worked great. At first, I was VERY pleased with this printer. Good printer, until it jams....UPDATE:  The scanner does not work with VISTA. This is the printer I've wanted but thought HP was charging too much and the price kept changing. Amazon was terrific and I received the printer I wanted at a lesser price.Rating:  4 and 1/2 stars HP's printer support staff do NOT talk to the computer support staff.
