switching the color is easy and smooth too. They correspond to different refillable color ink cartridges with medium points in black, blue, red and green. She loves the color choices and the nice grip and the writing smoothness. It was very nice to not have to bring different color pens. You simply click on the color you want, and voila!...there it is.Even though it's medium point, it writes closer to a fine point which I like. How can Bic possibly improve on that classic four color pen? First off you could just pick one color and have a pen that would virtually never run out of ink only because you would have plenty of time to replace a cartridge or two before you ever ran out altogether.Or you might be someone that likes two colors but you use one more than the other, you see where I'm going with this. I remember my first four color pen from middle school somewhere between 4 and 5th grade. Want another color? I remember my first four color pen from middle school days. I like that it's much more "grown up" in color. I remember these four color pens as being the envy of elementary school students. If you want a four color pen at a good price this is a fine choice. Who doesn't love the four color pen? That was how I always used the color method.The newly redesigned pen is comfortable and easy to use. It's super easy to change the color with a click and the ink flows nice and smooth with no globs.

To choose a color, just slide the color you want to use down and write away.

If you want a four color pen and like the comfort of the rubberized grip, get this pen, but don't expect any great writing experience.

If you're overusing one color, like blue or black - you can buy just that standard medium point bic refill for that one color.BOTTOM LINE: Great quality, functional pen at a good value.
