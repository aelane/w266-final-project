I've used this printer for about a week and have been very happy with the quality & speed of printing (including photos). Overall, I am very happy with the printer but can't recommend it based on the ink prices. I set the printer up and performed some color and black-and-white copies; this does not require a computer. No searching for a special printer driver to work with my Mac. It's a good printer for a techno-phobe. This printer works about as well as most others in print quality and image quality. This is much smaller than my Canon Pixma printer, and that's important to me as there is a premium on desk space. The printer itself is inexpensive but keep in mind that cartridges add up quickly. Consider this printer when looking for a good quality budget 3-in-one. We Purchased this printer a few months ago (August 2009):  A Total Piece of Junk.It printed 4 documents - read that 4 - and the ink tanks where down 50 per cent.After 15 documents at non-photo quality, the ink tanks where empty.

To do this, they basically give away the printer.

It matters because the printer unit is what aligns everything to perfection and transports the media precisely - the mechanical stuff.

Also, the printer is programmed to stop operating if any one of the four cartridges is low; you are not allowed to make your own decision whether to continue with black-only use for documents for example.I don't know about you, but I find these marketing manipulations a bit offensive.
