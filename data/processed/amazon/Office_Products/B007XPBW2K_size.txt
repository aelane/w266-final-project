With the size of this box though you certainly couldn't fill it with dishes or you could never lift it. A very good size for holding a lot of items, but not adding too much weight. The size makes it perfect for small appliances, pots/pans or other kitchen utensils. This is not always possible with smaller size boxes.Limitations1. At this size,  it is possible to make the load too heavy to handle easily. This size is the best of the four sizes I chose for my move. Cut to the size of the box put one whole piece at the bottom. That size of box (typically called a "Banker's Box," or a "file storage box") is very useful, of course, for moving all kinds of things besides files of paper: the size is perfect for holding all kinds of things in a typically household. ), and that's where so-called "Dish Boxes" come in.The size of this box, which has a fairly wide 18 inch by 18inch footprint, but is over two feet in height, is much more up up to the task of holding large and/or tall items. All uniform size, easy to stack and super protects the books.The Bankers Box Dish Box is the perfect size for some lamps and there will be space around for throw pillows, small soft items or air bags/packing peanuts, etc.And what I like best is that they can be used over and over and over and then re-cycled!Definitely recommend!

But because of large their size, you may actually end up with too many dishes in these, and find the box impossible to move.

The large size 18x18x28 leaves enough room for lots of tissue or packing peanuts to ensure things don't get joustled around too much or broken.

Their size should make them not suitable for dishes because you could easily exceed the 100 lbs limit if dishes and plates were all you were packing but they should be excellent for packing large and fragile objects such as lamps.I was happy that the boxes were very easy to set - for some reason setting up boxes tends to intimidate me - and it should be easy to take them back to their initial folded state once used so that they can be used again when needed.
