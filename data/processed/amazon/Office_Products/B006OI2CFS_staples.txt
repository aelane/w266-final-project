I have purchased many $10 staples and haven't lasted. ), I attempted to lift the top to insert the staples. I then proceeded to attempt inserting staples in the back of the stapler. Finally, I figured out that you need to insert the staples underneath the stapler after sliding out the back. Loading staples into this stapler is awkward and I am no convinced this is the best option.I like the pneumatic feel of this stapler but am unsure of longevity and durability. Also the included staples are only visible on the back, so if you're like me and cut open the packaging with scissors, you might miss them. The staples go pointy side up into the silver section, then push the black bottom piece back into place. After loading it with staples, I tried it with a few pages. Loading the staples is easier than most stapler's so A+ on ingenuity.This stapler can handle more sheets than the inexpensive one's sold office supply stores so that is a big plus, since I usually have to use binder clips for big documents - frustrating, bulky and expensive.I would recommend this as a good investment.August 23, 2012Update -increased from 4 star to 5 starThe more I use this stapler, the more I like it! It takes normal  1/4" everyday staples too. It takes standard staples. staples easily, so easily my mom with arthritic fingers can operate it. I love how easy it is to load the staples.
