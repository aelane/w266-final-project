Works great whether you have a few pencils or a whole passel of them to sharpen at one time.It's a little bulky, so have some desk space ready!The chamber for the shavings is deep enough and accommodates a lot of sharpening, which means you won't constantly be dumping it out. Even though I've used mechanical pencils for decades, I occasionally like to use wood pencils. It would get too expensive to replace mechanical pencils the rate they lose them. To get their pencils sharpened, I tried this iPoint against our old Boston electric sharpener. I mostly use mechanical pencils because I'm a perfectionist and need the tip to be sharp ALL the time. I own very few regular pencils, but the ones I have are dull. I was pleased with the result- my pencils came out pointy and precise!It's hard to tell from the picture, but yes, this is an electric pencil sharpener (there's no cord to be seen in the image!). If you have pencils of various widths to sharpen, you will want to look elsewhere.The design of the sharpener is sleek and attractive. Makes pencils sharp. I sharpened all the pencils in the office, one after another, and the sharpener did not relent. It blew through all the pencils. This will only work with standard pencils. It's fairly quiet, and works well with both graphite pencils and wax-based colored pencils. All pencils had a good point and none of them broke. It sharpens quickly, easily, and doesn't make the pencils too sharp. This occurs with both standard #2 pencils and the round barrel ones. It sharpened my pencils accurately and quickly without any hassle. It seems quite easy to use,sharpens the pencils quickly and is not too loud when in use. I can't picture having to sharpen 20 pencils a day, so I think in the average household it would be fine. This makes me want to use pencils even more. I work with pencils a lot and sharpen them at my desk quite often. It was sharp, efficient, well-made, and honed #2 pencils into the perfect point.
