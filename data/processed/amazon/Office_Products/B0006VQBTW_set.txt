The last set I triedExpo Washable Bullet Tip Dry Erase Markers, 6 Colored Markers) was a complete disaster as they stained my whiteboard and it took rubbing alcohol to clean it. This is a handy set of colors that's great for a fridge or magnetic whiteboard. This set, compared with the brights, just does not stand up as well. This set of dry erase markers is about what you'd expect for the price. I hung this set of markers on my family's dry erase calendar. In my set of 6 color pens, the purple pen was dull out-of-the-pack writing much thicker than the others.When you consider the low price and variety, I guess the old saying &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; applies. This is a good set of medium/fine-tip markers. The Quartet ReWritables Mini Dry-Erase Marker set is a great concept but poorly executed.Pros:None that I can think of...  Oh. I ditched the set and replaced it withLow-Odor Dry Erase Markers, Ultra-Fine Point, Assorted Colors, Set of 8. This darling little set of markers is not only cute but practical.

I have a set from the Board Dudes like these:Magnetic Markers Fun 6-Packthat LOOK the same on the outside, but the writing output of this Screamers set is MUCH superior--colors are brighter and much more vivid as they dry.Cap mounted erasers and magnetic caps make these convenient and "unloseable."

This is a nice set...fun colors that are bold and go onto the whiteboard nicely.

I bought this set because I was tired of the classic red/blue/green/black dry-erase markers and I'm so glad I did.My board looks like it has life, a story and best of all it always looks cheerful now..:)I use the fuchsia as a substitute to what I would use the red for example for something very important/urgent/etc.
