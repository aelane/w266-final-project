It comes off easily.Use this tape in several work areas; it is clean, it is handy; it is portable, it is workable, however; depending on the size of strip you use to adher, you could run out real quick. Also, its not as strong as tape, so if you really need to get something to "stick" in the short term, you can't count on it (meaning, don't use it for Christmas Presents). I'll stick to scotch tape and Elmers... It is easier than regular tape too.It rolls on fine and seems to stick pretty well. It is more expensive than tape and glue. But I also know how tape and glue get used by kids, and I don't know if people would appreciate their kids getting a hold of this and going through rolls of the adhesive dots because it is fun to use the roller.Overall, it's a neat little adhesive dispenser that is easy to use and gets the job done without a mess. Double sided tape isn't even an option with a 3 year old, since he'll pull the entire roll out to use at once.I received the dot roller, and decided to try it out on my little boy's art supplies. the little tape it dispenses is like double sided tape except a lot stronger & stickier. Merely drag the tape where you want your glue to go, and it places multiple tiny glue dots in a straight line about a centimeter wide along your paper. If you want a good tape runner, go with Kolo.Kolo Photo Album Accessories - Photo Tape Gunor if you want a back-up brand, go with Tombo Photo Tape, which allow refills. The tape has a cutter with an X-acto like precision. Great little tape dispenser and very easy to use, just pop open the cap and glide it across the surface needed. I thought I had it all when I discovered white out tape. I have been testing this "tape" for the last few weeks to make sure there was no issues with the adhesive causing problems with the photos that I will be using with it to keep the pictures that I take of the family looking good and not have issues with discoloration from the adhesives chemicals. The adhesive tape won't get dry after you spread it on the paper.I used another 3M Scotch adhesive tape roller which isn't in dot pattern and it wasn't as great as this dot-patterned type; it's less flexible and harder to use on curved paper/cutouts. The tape we had before was always getting stuck to itself or the tape dispenser, wasting pieces everytime it was used. So needless to say we go through tape and glue sticks very quickly. This little tape dispenser is perfect for many things like wrapping gifts and scrapbooking. The tape is durable and the dispenser is easy to use- you can just use it to apply the amount of tape you need instead of trying to estimate how much tape to tear off a roll. When tape is too obvious but glue is too messy, this product will let you stick your items without the fuss or hassle. The wrapping almost seemed professional-- no tape whatsoever! This is better than double sided tape any day. Basically the tape dots are on a plastic strip and lift off as you press and roll the the applicator and the used portion stays inside. Unlike tape, it is invisible. Double stick tape is awkward to apply and doesn't accomodate curves well.This Dot Roller solves these problems.Any place you are cut and pasting with real paper (as opposed to an electronic medium), this adhesive product does the job quicly and neatly. The "tape" is very easy to dispense and I have not had it get stuck once. Scotch tape is typically a drag to work with, especially if you want to be free and fast with your creations. I use this tape up in my classroom for many different things. I also couldn't control where the tape dots went as well as I could the straight lines of other runner tapes.Also, the refill costs about as much as the original dispenser. Rather than using tape, which need to be cut, this just lays down the adhesive, which can be applied in any manner you want. The tape folded over on itself just a tiny bit but then did keep going unlike a few others I've tried where it just made it stick to itself and not be able to roll properly anymore. This is essentially double-sided tape because the dots are so fine and so close together. It easily dispenses the double-sided tape and it sticks photos to paper and paper to paper very well. Basically, it is glue that rolls out like tape, kinda. Use like any lightweight tape--this is not meant for anything heavy-duty. Because it does not have the normal tape backing strip it can be run around curves without the dreaded bunching up on the inside corner. I previously used double-sided tape which was a pain. That's just about what this tape looks like once it has been put down. It can definitely be used for scrapbooking (and is SO much faster than double-stick tape!) I used to use two-sided tape for gift wrapping, but it tends to be a pain. Either the tape is sticking out and possibly attracting dust & hair, or it's just shy of the edge, which means something will catch the paper and fold it.Enter the hero of this tale - the Scotch Adhesive Dot Roller.You can get this thing right up to the edge, and never get your fingers sticky. There are no ugly tape sticking out or bumps from glue. It's neater and more permanent than clear adhesive tape. Just when I thought double sided tape was the way and the light, dot roller glue came along and introduced me to yet another new painless adhesive. I was suprised and very impressed with this tape runner.I
