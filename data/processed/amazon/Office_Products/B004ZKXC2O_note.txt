But, it's awkward to use a note that's too large, since it covers part of the page it is stuck on, possibly concealing text or illustrations in a book, report, etc. It is easy to detach the sticky note as there's already a pre-cut line at the top. Or it is just easy to take any sticky note off of the pad by gently lifting it. Often times a small sticky note is just not large enough, but with the extra sizes in this package there is a note that is perfect for every job. It's easy to remove a note from any of the pads without the entire thing falling apart.So whether you simply like color variety, have a need for color-coded organization, or just find yourself buying several sizes of sticky pads all the time and like the idea of just buying one package that suits all your needs, this is a handy little pad to have around. It seems silly to be gushing about a sticky note pad but I absolutely love this item. I've been talking up this little note pad and I love the bold colors! The note packs are all connected in a "book binding" fashion, so you flip to the pack you want and peel off a note without "disturbing" the other sticky note packs. I am a sticky note fanatic both at work and when I'm reading for pleasure, and this is a neat solution to having just the one I want while avoiding a pile of different sizes teetering on my desk. Whether you want to leave a brief note or a longer missive, Avery Steps can handle it in one tidy package without making you search around for different note pads. the best note product I've ever used.Not only are there 5 bright colors in the same tablet but there are also 5 different sizes to go along with those colors graduating up from 3 x 3 to 5 x 3 in 1/2 inch incriments. Removing one note from any of the sizes is simple and does not require dismantling and reassembling the whole block. Even if I end up taking the whole note out of the stack (including the perforated part) it works out fine.I think that Avery has done a great job with this product. Before you write a sticky note, how often do you think: "To write this out, I really need half an inch more sticky note." As I've started using these, I realize that I never notice I need a longer sticky note till I've got one mostly written. I can fold over the note and have my book marker in place.The adhesive on the back of these sticky notes are enough to keep the note in place but I don't have to worry about removing it from the page in my book or from wherever I am placing the note.We also use these for reminders on computers and the fridge. No longer do I have to separate the colored sticky note cubes apart by color so I can get the specific one I need. To get a complete note, you have to pull the note off at the binder and that leaves the tear strip still at the top of the note.And now that I have had them awhile I am also finding that they don't stick very well either.Overall a really good idea but very poorly implemented. With this one sticky note pad, you actually get five different sized sticky note pads rolled into one! I wasn't sure on the top note whether to tear it off at the top edge or pull it from under the binding. Ironically, it can sometimes be easier to remove the entire note (including the section above the perforation) than to try to remove a single one with one hand.Another apparent negative is that there are relatively few notes of any given size, but that gets offset by the fact that you become more likely to use a larger variety of sizes than you may have anticipated.
