Finally: a non-annoying sheet of labels. They handily come with a sheet of printing instructions explaining how to use them in this way. Just bend the sheet in half and the edges of the labels will peel back for easy lift off, a nice feature that I like.Finally, the 3M labels have a strong enough adhesive on the back that when you place the label on an  envelope...it sticks, which is exactly what I want an address label to do!From my use of this product, the 3M address labels seem to be well made so I can comfortably recommend this product, and give it a 5 star rating. Not ONCE has the label sheet jammed, very impressive!The "quick lift" feature actually works. They remove from sheet cleanly and easily and adher to envelopes tightly with no corner or edge lifting. I prefer to bend the label sheet at the perforation instead of tearing along the perforation to remove the label as described by Option B. I printed a sheet on my laser printer to use for labeling some products. So I may run the same sheet of labels multiple times through my laser printer. Will this sheet jam my paper feed?I am happy to report that the set up they use is supported by the newest version of windows and Word, which is excellent. Insert sheet to printer. Easy to peel off of the sheet & the adhesive sticks very well on a package or envelope. Easy to remove from the main sheet is a plus in my book as there is nothing more frustrating than trying to pull them off the sheet only to have them tear or the sticky part not come with the paper part.
