The markers in this kit are the large, chisel-point style. the markers have translucent tubes so you can see if you're running low on ink. The markers dry really quickly and did not smudge easily. The markers are also noticeably easier to erase with the included marker. The markers are great, and it's nice to have the spray and eraser to keep her whiteboard clear and clean. These markers are quite a bit larger, as they are meant for writing on larger white boards that have a tray on the bottom to hold them. These markers work as promised with a low odor. The markers are as good as any other brand, nice colors and don't dry out too quickly. These markers work fine, nice bright colors and are easy to erase, in these markers you can see the ink level so you know when you will need to replace them. I use whiteboard markers everyday with my students and have tried many brands. These markers write smoothly and are designed to not dry out easily/prematurely. I like that these markers are low-odor, as occasionally I've had markers from Expo or other brands that had a strong smell. These markers will perform well on any dry erase board, and this pack provides an eraser, which beats having to use towels or tissues to wipe the board clean... and when ink residue builds up over time you can use the cleaning spray to restore the surface to a clean, like-new state. All the markers fit on the ledge and I attached a magnet to the back of the eraser with a glue gun and it sticks fine on the edge of my board.Another great thing about this set is the chisel points. But the markers make the set worth it! This is an understatement - these markers have very little odor at all, even when held close to the nose it is difficult to detect any odor from these markers. These markers are very handy to have around for anyone who uses a dry-erase board regularly. I am happy to say that all markers have lasted through at least two weeks of classes and then some. I will definitely be purchasing these markers again.Natalie S. for Amazon Vine The markers are easy to see and erase without a problem.The big test for me was  a dry erase board in my kitchen that I had not cleaned in about six months. The markers and eraser are high quality. Each of the markers has a nifty ink level gauge as well.A spray cleaner is included with the kit for taking care of particularly big jobs, which is a nice addition, but there's a downside in that you have to wipe off the board before using it. These markers contain LOTS of fluid. The markers are good quality and last quite a while. But I would buy the markers again, no problem.
