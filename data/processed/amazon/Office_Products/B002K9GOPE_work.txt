Both work fine. Hopefully it stays this way.These work with the Avery 5160 template. I usually use Avery, but these work just as good. These work extremely well in your printer and don't jam. The 3M Address Labels are reasonably priced and work equally well with laser or inkjet printers. The 3M Permanent Address Labels work as well as any that I have used. I usually use Avery, but these work as well, if not better. Will this work in your inkjet printer?In a word, YES. These work as well as Avery labels and have the same form factor so they use the exact same template as Avery, too. These work with the Avery templates built into Word. I'm happy to report that these work, and quite well. Although a little less personal, it saves a LOT of work and I won't be going back to hand-writing so many addresses!These labels worked well and appear to have a strong adhesive. These work.
