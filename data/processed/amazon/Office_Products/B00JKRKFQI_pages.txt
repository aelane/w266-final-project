You can't add pages to a section where you need more. And, tearing pages out messes up those sheets. 200 pages with four dividers (40 sheets per section. )The pages measure a full 8 1/2 x 11&#34;. )The pages are good quality and are &#34;college&#34; ruled which is convenient when you need to take notes quickly. The pages might benefit by being rounded (the edges are squared. The pages turn easily without tearing. The pages are perforated and tear easily from the perforation or from the spiral binding if you need to do so.The four dividers have pockets front and back and are reinforced with a layer of tape at the top of the pocket to add durability and resistance to tearing.Because of the way it's constructed, I can see this surviving fairly well in a clean backpack through the course of a semester or school year.

The pages are perforated so if he's careful, they'll rip out neatly.

The pages don't come out unless you want them too.

The pages are perforated so you can cleanly remove them without ripping the paper from the wire loops.
