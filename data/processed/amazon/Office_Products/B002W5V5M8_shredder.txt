I was quite disappointed by this shredder. It's marketed as a DVD/CD shredder, but it really is only good for doing paper.It has a separate shredder designed to shred DVDs, CDs and credit cards, with a separate container for the pieces. The shredder box & packing box were in great condition with no dents, but the plastic container the shredder sits upon was cracked with a few small plastic fragments broken out. This is a great little shredder. With this shredder I do not have to do any of that anymore.There is a tiny basket that is positioned at the bottom inside the larger one under the CD/DVD slot. the shredder itself is very solid. My shredder arrived with no damage. Although the shredder seemed to be packed securely, there was a crack in the container that holds the paper. This is attached to the shredder itself.I agree that this is top heavy, as most shredders are. I let it cool down but the shredder would no longer function.There was also an odor while I was testing this out. The shredder works like a champ for paper in most regards. I was looking for a shredder with CD/DVD/CC shredding capabilities, so was excited to try this one Aleratec.Having used it for some time now, I'm finding that is a great shredder; handling a decent amount of paper and easily destroying the "harder" items such as credit cards.I thing I recommend for anyone who purchases this shredder is to read the instructions. It's a decent extra shredder if you have a larger one also, but if you're in an office, this should not be your main go-to shredder. It's not any speedier than our old shredder, in fact I think the Aleratec is slower but it does take a couple more sheets of paper.Overall, not impressed. This shredder has three things that differentiate itself from other shredders.1. This shredder cross-cuts the paper into tiny pieces making it virtually impossible to put the original document back.2. This shredder seems to have a very powerful motor. All in all, I recommend this shredder. This shredder can handle a decent sized stack of papers. My former shredder would choke on anything more than 4 sheets. Unfortunately, I cannot rely on this shredder for that. It would be nice of this shredder would do the job. Otherwise though, it's a decent shredder.
