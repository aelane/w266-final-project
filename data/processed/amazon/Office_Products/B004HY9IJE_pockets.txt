It is a little stiff new and the inside pockets are very tight to start with so don't try to shove many papers in there unless you want your reports looking wreaked. There are pockets on both the inside front and inside back cover. If you feel inside the pockets you will notice a smooth plastic surface and this allows papers to easily slide in and out without getting caught or bent. There are two pockets inside to stow loose papers. There are two sturdy inside pockets, one for the front cover and one for the back. Inside we also have two half-page pockets and a pen holder as well as a business card holder that looks very professional. Well, the pockets are cardboard lined for rigidity, which is a cheapie move bound to ultimately affect binder durability. Inner pockets, inner business card pocket, inner pen pocket5. The pockets are not very sturdy, and appear to be lined in (thin) cardboard. There are two nice pockets for non-punched papers, and a 3-ring set-up for punched. Standard pockets are also included. It also has 2 inner pockets, but the material is a weird canvasesque, so the papers do not slide in and out easily, but rather get stuck and crinkled.
