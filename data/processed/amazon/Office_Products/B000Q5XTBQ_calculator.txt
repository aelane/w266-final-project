The fx-260 comes pretty close to 'ideal' for a 6- or 7-grader that needs a calculator in school, performing all the basic arithmetic (that kids should learn to do it without a calculator first) and helping to introduce them to some of the more sophisticated math operations. We are very impressed with this calculator. The Casio FX-260 is a reliable, inexpensive compact scientific calculator with a built-in solar panel. I've been using this calculator mostly for mathematical and statistical functions and I had no single problem, although for some users the models with larger LCD could be advised or if the scientific functions are not needed, maybe this model would be overcrowded with functions for you. This scientific calculator is perfect for engineering students. I ordered this calculator because I needed a single lined calculator for my MA22300 calculus class like wtf? Why a single lined calculator? I think I might be using this calculator until planet Earth enters the next generation of technology. I needed a scientific calculator for the math class I was taking. My Casio calculator is more than 20 years old. The only calculator allowed on the test is this Casio fx 260. This calculator is pretty good and very easy to use. I needed a non scientific calculator for a class and this one works wonderfully
