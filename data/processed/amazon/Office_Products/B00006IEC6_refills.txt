These refills were easy to change and the color is good and bright.These have fine tips.I have G2 pens and these were exactly the same as I had in my pens before.I was really satisfied with the purchase and the price. These refills were much needed for note-taking in my science classes. I bought these refills because I had a box of Pilot Gel Pens. I still have two refills. They are long lasting refills. I highly recommend these refills. Grip which uses the same refills. I use these refills for my Pilot G2 pens. These refills fit myPilot Metropolitan Fine Writing Gel Penalong with my newerPilot MR Collection Rollerball Penand without these refills, neither pen would be worth it.Interestingly these also fit theamPen New Hybrid 2-in-1 Stylus, something that I found out by experimentation last year when looking for a replacement to their refill. The refills fit right in the Gel Ink pens. Now I only buy the refills unless I break the barrels to the pens. Since In never buy any other pen then the Pilot Dr Grip Gel I certainly buy their refills. When I learned these magnificent refills fit my Waterman rollerball pens, everything changed in an instant.
