I can't recommend this stand more to anyone who owns a MBP and is having heat issues! Heavy, well made laptop stand. The stand of choice for out company (a web development company). It's great for what it is, but it's not a portable laptop stand. I picked this stand mainly due to the aesthetics, but there are numerous other merits to it:- Strong, wobble-less design (unlike others I have tried)- Promotes better air flow (small reduction in temps noticed)- Elevates Macbook Aluminum 13" to an excellent height for dual monitor usage- Easy cable management with the hole on the back- Even when not using secondary monitor, this has helped my posture by elevating the laptop screen- Finish is VERY close to the Apple aluminum- Cutout for easy lid openingOverall there is just no comparison! This is absolutely the best stand for Apple (and other) laptops on the market. I use this stand with a MacBook Pro at the library. The stand will handle a 7 lb. This stand is exactly what I was looking for - clean design, metal, a great height. I highly recommend this stand! I sent for this stand with that sentiment lurking guiltily in the back of my mind with the possibility I might just be boxing it up and sending it back. First, the stand raises the laptop 5 1/2 inches, bringing it more to a more natural working eye level, instead of constantly having your head and neck tilted down toward the desk. This stand is perfect and really helps eliminate the backache and posture problems associated with laptop use! Though the stand is not adjustable I found the angle to be perfect for my laptop. I use this stand with a 14 inch Ultrabook and it functions well for that size. This laptop stand is perfect, both in angle and height.

This stand is all aluminum, so it essentially acts as a giant heat sink for the MacBook.

I'm glad I went for it!The stand is very sturdy and durable, without being really heavy.

Before this, I just had my Macbook Pro tilted up on a smaller stand.
