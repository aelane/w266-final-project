Second, the printer is a bit noisy with its paper handling.Aside from that, it's a great device. So I sent our old printer off to college with our daughter and I installed this new one in our home office.The installation was easy and intuitive. We use our printer almost exclusively for photocopying and printing. Our old printer was rear-fed, so there was a panel that flipped out in the back and the paper stood upright waiting to be fed into the printer. This allows me to move the printer closer to the back of the desk and closer to the wall. This actually gives the printer an effectively larger footprint than our old one had.The other thing that is a design flaw is that when the printer spits out a page it will fly out and onto the floor. The Canon PIXMA is pretty heavy, even for a printer--even especially for a printer under 100$. When opening up the printer to change out the cartridge or lifting the fax/scan hood, it does so with a slight bit of give--meaning that it is falling open or loosely attached. Why I rated the printer so high was not really because it can do almost anything you want in a home office setting, rather for it does the `little' things. The printer is not very loud and is comparable to a low conversation with someone. If you are looking for a printer under 100$, this should be on your list of possibilities. This printer uses a single color cartridge so that you have to change out the color cartridge any time one color is consumed. And I even have aCanon PIXMA Pro9000 Mark II Inkjet Photo Printer (3295B002)printer that prints up to 13X19 prints. Now that is a fantastic printer. Since I only use the printer occasionally, it doesn't use up much power. With this printer the screen is not a digital display rather a 2 line LCD calculator style display. This printer it took me a while to figure out how to enter my wifi WEP key manually as I don't use the "one button setup. I want a printer that not only looks good as this one does but also is built solid. Nothing really exceptional and it isn't the worst printer I've ever owned. I think personally I would pay a little more for a printer because you can really get more quality and value for your money, BUT if you just want something really inexpensive that works, this printer can get the job done without too much trouble. Canon Office Products PIXMA MX432 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and FaxThis is a nice, relatively small, all in one printer. This was easy to remove while prepping the printer. The printer then starts up. This is a nice inexpensive all in one printer, with an actual telephone corded Fax. This is a nice printer at a decent price with nice included software. I would never recommend this printer or any other cannon printer for that matter. This printer is another step up for me, with the wireless capability being the feature in which I was most interested. I hate to pan the printer; I still love and use my Canon MP830. In general, this is a good printer for its price point. However, it was easy to introduce the printer to the network through our computer, via USB cable. They package the printer with smallish cartriges that can only print a few pages, then they make you go buy the big cartriges that cost as mush as the printer to replace ... argh.So if you occasionaly print a page or two, then this is a great printer that can scan and copy and fax and .... This printer is an upgrade from my previous all in one printer. I can place the printer in a separate area and print, scan, etc., from any computer and I can use mobile printing to print from my Android phone.I also like the fact that it prints quality photos and this Canon printer is compatible with my Canon HD Video Camera to use direct print and print HD photos from video, which is actually really cool.The feed tray can handle up to 30 sheets and does print fairly fast. This is a nice all in one printer at a decent price. With my Epson printer, I just went through the network setup, let it find my router, and then typed in my WEP password. First, all in all, I really like this printer. I also own the similarly priced HP Photosmart Premium Wireless e-All-in-One printer, which makes it easier for me to explain what I do and don't like about this Canon.Let's get print quality out of the way first...to me, most color printers in this price range are perfectly acceptable, and the Canon MX432 fits right in with the rest. Once the printer was on my wireless network, the rest of the setup took place wirelessly. I set up the printer for my network, and AirPrint functionality just took care of itself: open an e-mail on my iPhone, go to print it, and voila! There was my HP printer. Also, I assume that if you wait long enough to buy this printer, Canon will probably be updating the firmware before you buy it (if they DON'T, then hopefully they will include clear steps on how to do it yourself). The printer I have been using for a few years wasCanon PIXMA MP160 All-In-One Photo Printer (Gray)and for awhile it was all I needed, the printer worked great and the scanner was great. Forget about turning ON or OFF this printer at night especially if you family is sleeping. Its a nice compact well designed printer although its a bit on the heavy side but that's not an issue. I'm hoping that this printer does the same. This is definitely a printer to consider if you are in the market not only for a new printer but an all-in-one too. I won't buy another printer unless it isCanon. I have been putting off buying a new printer for the last year because of the all in one features and just not being able to decide which one to go with. I keep the printer in an enclosed space which is smaller than the size of the printer with its paper tray down so I have to continually remove the paper and put the paper tray up when I want to put the printer away.
