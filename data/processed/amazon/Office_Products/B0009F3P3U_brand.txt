This is the best brand of tape. I find that it is the best brand out there. And since this brand really isn't all that expensive, I find that it is well worth the money. It's a good brand of tape, reliable. I always go back to Scotch brand. It's right up there with Kleenex and Bandaid - its brand name is synoymous with the product itself. You'll want to stick with the brand name for this product. When compared to non-name brand types of tape, Scotch leaves your end result looking almost invisible on paper and when wrapping presents. We've used Scotch brand tape products for many years and this one is the same great quality. I've been using the Scotch brand for years. Stick with Scotch brand Magic Tape. But Scotch brand tape is vastly superior to the generic crap my wife usually buys, because:  (1) it tears cleanly so you can apply it, (2) it doesn't split along its length and cause you to lose your sanity trying to get back to a single strip the entire width of the roll, and (3) it doesn't have gobs of adhesive that come off the sticky side and stick to the side that's not supposed to be sticky.I'm not sure I see the advantage of the three small rolls in this pack; I prefer larger single rolls myself. The Scotch brand has a excellent reputation when it comes to producing quality products, and this tape is no exception.This is their "magic" line, which means that it is "invisible" in use, and that is pretty much correct. I find the Scotch brand the best and well worth the few extra cents you pay for it compared to other cheaper brands. Works well as Scotch brand magic tape always has.
