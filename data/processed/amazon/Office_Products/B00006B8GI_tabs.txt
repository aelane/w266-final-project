All of these tabs are self-adhesive, so it saves you time from having to hunt down lost inserts.Avery comes up with nifty ways of organizing information and this is not an exception. After lining up the tabs and the strip, you can apply them all at once but to remove the remainder of the strip requires a little fiddling with each label... at least they all got positioned perfectly and that's the important point. Recommended for easy, neat, nice-looking tabs. The tabs are great to quickly customize categories that need to be specific. More useful than pre-printed tabs that just say BANK, HOME, AUTO, etc. Sure, if you manage to get it just right, your tabs will look gorgeous. I wouldn't recommend these tabs...old school dividers with tabs that you can either write on or print out label for are MUCH easier and more practical for most uses. The 5 tabs per set will give me just what I'm  going to need to work my Family Journal up!

For just a few tabs... it's just easier to write it in neatly.

They let you label five tabs at once using a special label strip.

The tabs are easy to use and they look so nice in the file.
