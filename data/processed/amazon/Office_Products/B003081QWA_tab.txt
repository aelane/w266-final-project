Just type your tab titles into the website template and print. If you are looking for tab dividers that will really look professional then these are a good choice. Each tab page is a unique color so you can easily tell the difference. Overall these tab dividers are a bit more expensive but they are good for important projects that need to look their best. The 5 tab pages also come with a clear front protective cover as well as a rear title page holder. I am not afraid of pulling on the tab to flip to the section I need unlike the other paper tab dividers. I love how there are no little tab labels to get lost and they are SUPER good quality to last longer. There is also an online Javascript tab label generator. The extra wide tab allows for more information to be written and the clear colored (transparent) dividers allows for the reader to easily read the 'cover' or first page of document.Must have for easy filing and reference!

You can write on the tab but not insert a typed label (not a professional look).

You can design and print the tab titles page by using the templates at Wilson-Jones.com or with most word processors.
