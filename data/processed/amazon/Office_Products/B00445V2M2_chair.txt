So, we picked up this chair as a replacement.I've been using this chair for a week or so, and here's the review of my experience so far.1) Some assembly required. The chair arrives in a box that weighs close to 40 lbs., and it's up to you to put it together. This chair is designed so that when you recline both the seat cushion and seat back rotate back. I received this chair through the Amazon Vine program. The chair was easy to assemble, and within 10 minutes I had a new work chair.I find the chair comfortable and easy to adjust. This is a good chair for staying alert and comfortable at work, that seems built to last for a while.I think it's worth the asking price. Time for a new chair I think. If I had to sit in a chair all day, I would want something more comfy and with a higher back rest. The chair seemed a bit stiff at first, but it can be adjusted to lean back easier, and perhaps over time, it would loosen up a bit. This chair was easy to assemble, taking about 20 minutes from the time I opened the box until it was complete. It's rather uncomfortable if you don't sit completely centered in the chair. This chair is not as good as the Herman Miller chair I have at work, but it is fine for my home use. This is the chair I received through the Vine program instead of the chair that was offered. It also looks okay.Unfortunately:--Aside from being able to roll the chair around and raise or lower it, it's not adjustable.--Leaning back is only possible if you plant your feet on the floor and push, and the chair only moves a little.--No discernable lumbar support. Certainly not as good as another chair we recently purchased.I would have liked to rate this chair between a 2 and a 3, but all things considered, it's more toward the "2" end of the scale.It would be okay for a high school student's room or for someone who doesn't spend a huge amount of time in the home office, but if you want something you'll be able to work in, comfortably, this may not be your cup of tea either. Although this is not as pretty as my old chair, I do like how it improves my posture. I have to say this is the best chair I have had. This chair has a great lumbar support on the lower back. the chair is sturdy and comfortable. I find myself sometimes rocking and it the chair moves with you. Overall Excellent chair. This doesn't feel like a Hermann Miller chair, and it doesn't cost like a Hermann Miller chair either. And the chair portion simply pushes onto the gas lift.--The allen wrech provided is all you need. It also tilts the entire chair, not just the back. Overall I would highly recommend this chair for home and work, if you have an office area then this is the chair for you. This HON chair is a good value. The chair mechanism is pneumatic.However, there are two downsides, depending on your needs. As could be expected, the chair is not a high-back but a mid-back. Not sure if this chair is specially designed to promote good posture. It is difficult to slouch in this chair, as the backrest has a curved shape to it. The HON HVL521 chair is comfortable, easy to assemble, comes well packaged and everything is labeled corresponding to very clear assembly directions. This chair does not have the arm adjustments of the HON HMH01 but has adjustable seat pressure. This chair is not as firm as the other HON chair I reviewed and it does give the ability to lean back without any special adjustment feature. Not to be seen as a negative, this is a chair Made in China with mostly heavy plastic parts with metal used for the important connection between the seat and back. It seems solid and substantial, therefor I recommend this chair without reservations. I really like this chair. Seems the chair did not need it. It seems to be a better chair than the original Vine offered chair.The directions for assembly were very easy and clear to read or follow in pictures. I am 5'5" and when I set the chair so my feet rest on the floor, the arm rests will slide nicely under my computer desk, allowing me to sit closer to the screen. I am happy with this chair, it is just not the one which was ordered.I
