However, the security markings are poorly done and information is easily read when holding the envelopes up to a light. Rather than being an added security feature, those cuts only partly make up for the non-permanent sticking.The security print is also not the best. The security print also works well. I would use heavier security envelopes for anything substantive and continue using a security stamp over the flap. As a security product they're certainly not high security, although they're fine for run of the mill business correspondences that you wouldn't want to have accidentally disclosed by a non-persistent attacker. These are security envelopes. The blue security tint is functional without being cheesy. So I then took an old lick-style security envelope and the check account number was much harder to make out.Oh well, I had high hopes for this, but I would not mail just a check in this envelope by itself. Since security is supposed to be such a big feature of this envelope, I cannot recommend it on that premise. I like the added security feature of this envelope, good for sending checks or private letters. The blue security lining keeps your mail private. The security feature worked. The security printing is also nice. The security shading on the paper is sufficient. I needed security envelopes, so ordered these and when it came time to reviewing them thought, "What's so great about a new envelope?" The Quality Park "Reveal N'Seal" envelopes seemed to have a good, dark and intricate security pattern to me, but to be honest, it hadn't been something I've thought about before when using security envelopes and just always took for granted. We use self-sealing security envelopes at work for all correspondence with sensitive information. And although the security portion works, the envelope itself is fairly thin and does not protect contents as well as I had hoped. To add to the security, the envelope is impossible to open without damaging the flap so tampering is readily apparent.There is enough adhesive to hold the flap secure, yet not so much to be a nuisance.Although the reciepant will end up with 4 straight and clean tears in the flap, it is still easy enough to open the envelope without completly destroying the envelope or the contents.The box the envelopes came is unfortunatly also tamper resistant... Too much adhesive on the box led to a unserviceable storage box for these envlopes. It has security marks so you can't see through it to the contents. I started with the security printing. The security on the flap is essentially little 3/16 inch places that are cut and only held together by a tiny bit of envelope so they will tear when trying to open it. I think the security features are better than most on the market, if that is an issue. The security print on the inside is adequate, even though the paper is a bit thinner than I'm used to. They are secure, with the usual blue security pattern making it pretty much impossible to read anything the envelope might contain. It is infrequent that I need a high security envelope, but it does happen. The extra security features and the easy to use Reveal-n-Seal closure made these envelopes a worthwhile purchase for me. If you are concerned about security for a particular item you are better served to enclose the item of interest in thicker paper. The added security is not flawless, nor is it very impressive. The security feature is nice, though I must admit I did not pick them up for that reason (but I really could not read anything I had placed inside). Who knew there were still innovations out there for the rather plain security business envelope? Like all security envelopes, they have a nice pattern printed on the inside so there is no show through.But what I love about them is that the self-sealing mechanism is the best I've ever used. It's lined with an overprinted security pattern that makes it just about impossible to tell what's inside when it's closed. Now that's security. Moving on, we have the security envelope with the design inside that is mean to foil nosy people like myself and protect the contents inside the envelope from prying eyes. Some security envelopes are better than others. They're a security envelope, but in the right circumstances you can see through the envelope. Overall, a good basic security envelope with a better than usual self-sealing flap. Reasonably priced for back-up security. It's a white security envelope with a seal - no licking required - what can more you really say about it? The blue security print is fine, the seal strip is a bit thinner than most competetors, but it had a solid grip on the flap. Has security seal and is a very high quality paper. The security lining/printing inside is also important as the paper used in these envelopes is relatively thin. This is pretty much your standard security envelope. Quality Pack Reveal-N-Seal Envelopes provide the needed security for mailing private documents. These also have the standard security pattern on the inside. The security tinting work well, like other similar envelopes. This one is otherwise a totally normal security envelope, but it will display a red warning if the envelope has been tampered with. If I'm really concerned about the security of something I'm mailing I will buy something secure at the post office and mail it with special tracking. They have a security pattern on the inside to prevent someone seeing through the envelope and I like the fact that you don't have to lick them and taste glue.I've always preferred the self-sealing kind, but these are a little are a little awkward to work with as you have to pull a slender strip of the fold-out adhesive that's thinner than it needs to be to seal the envelope.So, being a self-seal type is good, but not as easy to work with as those you pull the strip off of. If you want or need security and want it in a self-sealing envelope, this will definitely need your needs.And that, my friend, is pretty much all there is to say about it. These are your basic security envelopes. The advertised security tint comprising little blue diamonds seems to work effectively.The adhesive strip could be a little larger, as initial adhesiveness seemed a little lacking. The security feature is nice too. If you're security conscious, these are the envelopes for you! I like security envelopes and I don't like licking. The inside security pattern is effective and purportedly specifically designed to enhance privacy. These security envelopes are ideal for mailing out checks or items you don't want detected in case someone gets their hands on your unopened mail (like, sending cash in the mail). The internal security  pattern is a real good idea these days.Recommended. These are "security" or "privacy"  "business sized" envelopes.S
