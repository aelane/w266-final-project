This is my favorite pencil of all time. 2-part mechanical 0.7mm pencil with cap. The little pencil also holds quite a large amount of backup lead... This pencil is ideal for my needs. This pencil is tiny which makes it not very comfortable to write with. Yes I bought this pencil at Amazon, but the review system did not seem to know this or provide me a place to indicate it. This may be the best mechanical pencil I've ever owned.I have had more expensive mechanical pencils. This is an expensive pencil and should be 100% made of metal not half plastic.

The pencil is elegantly formal looking in black with a knurled metal midsection for grip.

If this pencil had the name Mont Blanc inscribed on it and a price tag 10 times what it is, I wouldn't think twice and would consider buying it.

If you use a mechanical pencil often, you'll want to own this one added to your personal items for everyday use.
