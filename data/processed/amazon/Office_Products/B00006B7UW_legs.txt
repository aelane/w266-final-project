I'm afraid to tighten the legs too much for fear of cracking the plastic.Another potential drawback to the item, depending on your set up, is its size. You can't pick this up with the legs attached. It is inconceivable to me that 3M didn't seal up the legs better. The legs are too week and they wobble when you move the item as a whole. And the legs wobble. I love how the legs can pivot so you can stand it up straight or you can lean the book back. The legs are weighted, butwould be far more stable with some sort of crossbar installed between them...this could certainlybe done by someone who is reasonably handy. Unfortunately, after I slid the two "legs" into a groove on each side of the document holder and screwed them in I found they moved when I have moved the document holder. The legs are heavy which is good. The legs on this are pretty heavy and it makes this copy holder awkward to move around easily. You need to unscrew the legs, which are heavy because they're filled with sand, and then slide them on the appropriate sides. After the legs are on then you'll see that the holder can be adjusted either forward or backward.
