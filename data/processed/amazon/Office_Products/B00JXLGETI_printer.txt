You will pay about $120 more than you would for a smaller printer. I really liked this printer until it came time to replace the ink cartridges.When I need to buy a printer I look at the prices of the cartridges, and the ones for this printer were very cheap. This is an impressive printer. For a printer of this quality for wide format printing, scanning, and wireless at that, this printer is a great investment. This printer is an excellent choice for a small office or department. This makes an inkjet printer a bit more practical in an office environment. This is my third Epson printer. I took the printer out at the garage and carried into my home office. This printer prints beautiful pages of clear images and type. I totally love this printer. Scanning is WAY better than my old printer and I loved that one. I highly recommend buying this printer. The printer does have Wi-Fi and connecting via Wi-Fi on the WF-7610 is much easier than previous WorkForce all-in-one's that I haved used.-  The Epson WorkForce WF-7610 utilizes Epson 252 DURABrite Ultra Standard cartridges.-  If you need dual paper tray capability, you want to look towards the WorkForce 7620!-  The printer also comes with Ethernet ports, for those considering a network printer for the office.- Media Card Slot for SD or MS Duo is on the front of the printer.JUDGMENT CALL:The Epson WorkForce WF-7610 is the all-in-one printer I have been wanting for all these years. This is a huge printer and has everything you can think off. It is absolutely perfect all in one Office printer. This is an amazing all in one printer! I have to have the printer on before I put the paper in the rear hopper--otherwise the printer will complain about a paper jam.I'm upgrading from the similar looking WF-7010 and this has several differences. My old printer had two trays, which I kept filled with both letter paper and photo paper. First of all let me say that Epson makes a great printer in general. It's a very fast printer and the quality of prints are great. This printer does it. You do not want to move this very heavy printer around. The Epson 7610/7620 are the exact same printer with one difference: paper capacity. The printer remained connected after the initial wi-fi setup. If you are looking at this printer you likely need the wide-format capability. The Epson WorkForce WF-7610 is a great printer if you're looking for a printer with large printing and large scanning capabilities. This is a solid printer to have if you have multiple people printing at once or simply go through a lot of printing and scanning in your household. This is our second Epson printer and from our experience with the first one, we've found them to be reliable and able  to perform most tasks we throw at them quickly and well.One of the most outstanding features of this one is its ability to print, copy and scan larger than standard sizes. The printer immediately appeared  on our network and  after I entered our network password, it was recognized and online. I like this printer as I've liked all Epson printers. I set the printer up and took it to my writing studio, which isn't internet connected. And this printer really shines at wide format. In the past I would just wait for my old printer to die, but this printer offers features that make it worth the upgrade now.This printer has all the things you have come to expect from Epson. What I will tell you is that this is an exceptional printer and an exceptional value.OK, now for the nitty gritty. The printer comes with one of those large foldout posters with simple &#34;Start Here&#34; Instructions. The printer's display is an improvement on earlier models, with a larger screen and better touch response. The printer also had decent range, though your mileage will vary. And this is an amazing printer, easy to set, very easy! This is a very large and heavy printer at 22 inches wide and over 40 pounds.This is a color inkjet printer / scanner / copier / fax &#34;all in one&#34; device.Ease of setup: Below average. Unboxing and setting up printer and software installation time is at least 45 minutes. The printer is &#34;plug and play&#34; ready but not if you want full use of all the features.Print Quality: Very good. I'm a big Epson printer fan and have had many models over the years. The printer is able to handle 13x19 size paper and can scan 11x17 paper. I have been using this printer now for a couple of weeks. The printer lives up to the speeds that it says it will give you the copies.
