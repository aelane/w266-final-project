The size of the sticky note I want to use, at any given time, depends on whether I want to write text on it and how much. The next size is lime green. Last (and the biggest size) is hot pink.I think this is cool because sometimes I need a sticky note that is bigger than a regular sticky note. I often need larger than the traditional 3x3 size sheet and this pad provides that size yet allows me access to smaller sheets rather than wasting the larger sheets on smaller tasks. Each size is a different color which is also nice. if I want the biggest size, it is always going to be magenta, if I want the smallest size it is always going to be orange. The size and choice colors are Still really handy. It's easy to grab one of any size -- it doesn't break up the stack to pull one from the middle. Just decide which size you need for your note or reminder, write on it, and tear it out of the pad. Each size is a different color (orange, yellow, green, blue and pink). It's very easy to get to the next size pad, good for jotting down quick notes, and, the best thing about it, you don't have to look far for a larger notepad! Just pick the size that is needed and fold back the other sizes, and peel it off. Not only do you have the size you need but there are no other pages left with sticky on the top. Rather than having a single size in a block, these are of varying sizes and colors, stair-stepped to make getting the size/color note needed very easy. They come packaged as a stepped size pad which is very neat and tidy. They are bold but I really like them.They size of the notes vary by half inch increments with the smallest being three inches and the largest being five inches. Each size is seperated by a base page, so you can easily remove from the middle. I can choose either the size or the color, but not both since each size comes in only one color per size. It is a nice size pad, that allows you to select how large a note you want to write on, or just select by color. And now they are even cooler because with Avery Steps Sticky Notes you can use the size of color of your choice, without having to break the pad apart. Each size is a different color for easy identification and each note is easily removed regardless of position within the stack. The smallest size I use regularly is about 1.25 by 1.5 inches, so Avery's pack of five sizes was not the perfect solution for me, but it has sizes up to the largest one I use regularly, and has everything in between.Having five sizes together like this has advantages and disadvantages. Having them all together is far more convenient, and makes it readily apparent which relative size to use.The quality of the glue -- how well it sticks, how long it lasts, how well it releases, and how well it can be reapplied -- is very good and perhaps better than with competing products.
