I was a bit skeptical at first as far as easily making professional-looking business cards, but wow ... after using the online card templates and printing out my first cards within minutes of starting, I am impressed.The variety of templates available on Avery's site was fairly large, with card styles to fit almost any need. I have made up business cards with a number of different brand of blank cards and I have to say I like these the best. This is a fantastic looking, stiff business card, for what i do... I create my own business cards and have used Avery cards for years. I am sure they would be just fine for business cards as well. They do not look quite as nice as professional business cards... Perfect for a small business or individual who only needs a few cards. While these are not as thick as a professional business card, they are decent and good to use for somebody that may just be starting up or need cards in a hurry. If your looking for professional business cards though, these probably aren't for you as the card stock is thinner than professional cards.

You can either create your own business card from scratch or use one of the pre-designed cards that you can find online at Avery's website.If you don't have an Internet connection you must have MS WORD to access the Avery Template for the business cards (in MS WORD 2007 the template # is 28877 and it's the same thing--but you can download the current one #28878).

Unless you are well versed in MS WORD or making a simple business card with name, address, phone number and email address info only, using WORD can be a little tricky.There's an information sheet that explains how to access the template in MS WORD, which is pretty simple and bare bones, so even if you don't know how to use the program, you'll still be able to get to the template itself.If you don't have MS WORD or access to an Internet connection then you'll have to call customer service.
