The dispensers themselves have a bit of adhesive on the back so you can be CRAZY and stick them on cubcile walls, notebooks, anywhere.Clever enough design, but I really doubt the dispensers will last more than a refill or two. These are very handy little dispensers. These Post-It dispensers are not really anything special. If the three dispensers were all black, I'd give it five stars. These dispensers are made of very thin plastic and have a re-usable/re-positionable adhesive backing. The little dispensers come in a variety of cheerful colors and the notes are the super sticky kind so they won't fall off right after you hang them up. The dispensers use the Z-fold style of Post-it notes. The dispensers are great, I like how I can stick them wherever I need. I LOVE these Post-it dispensers. Maybe.I used one of the dispensers in my car, and so far it has stayed in position, but I don't know if it will hold up to the rigors of a Michigan winter in my freezing car overnight. I give FIVE STARS to these handy little POST-IT dispensers that finally solves the problem of trying to remember where you last saw your pad of Post-It notes. These dispensers can go anywhere (e.g. I have other dispensers that work better, and often times I don't even use a dispenser.

I can't speak to laptops that are more textured.I think that these Post-it dispensers would attach & be easily removable on any slick surface.

The dispensers are easy to refill, attach, and detach, although you may not be able to reattach them more than a couple of times.

They do provide you with three different dispensers -- different colors/designs.
