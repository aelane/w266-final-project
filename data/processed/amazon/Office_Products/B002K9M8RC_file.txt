these are perfect for file folders and are equivalent to the avery 5366, so you should be able to use the label function from your MS Word without any problems. I have several file cabinets in my household and 3M File Folder Labels with Permanent Adhesive have come in handy with my organization. I like these file folder labels. These file folder labels have enough room to put your file name and a little extra info on them and since I tend to use things for more than their intended purpose, I've found these to be handy for labeling plastic containers, boxes, and storage bins in the garage. The 3M Permanent Adhesive file folder labels add another useful label to my collection.The file folder labels are a really good value. Since most of my file labels are 1 or 2 words, I'd have to use a 16 or 18pt font just to fill out the entire label without leaving too much white space. You can use a 3M file folder label template to print multiple file folder labels, or you can use the Avery 5366 template, which works just fine with these labels. These 3M file folder labels are easy to use, a nice bright white and stay stuck where you stick them. Instead of writing on your file folders, just insert these correctly into your inkjet or laser printer, select the Avery 5366 template, type in what you want, and print. Now our hanging file is super organized and well labeled and either of us can find exactly what we're looking for without pulling out a magnifying glass! I've always used Avery file labels, but these came up through Vine and I thought they were worth a shot.I use MS Word, and was able to just snag the Avery 5366 template, plug in my information, and print. These file folder labels work flawlessly, both in printing and handling. Very sticky, sure to stay on your file folders forever. Not only are they handy for relabeling file folders, but they are not terrible to peel off. These file folder labels work great in laser as well as inkjet printers and adhere extremely well to the folders. )I like to make my file folder labels in Excel and then do a Mail Merge to print them on the labels.
