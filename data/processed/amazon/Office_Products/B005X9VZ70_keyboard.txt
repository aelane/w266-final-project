It has a QWERTY keyboard, which is a convenient feature in such a small hand-held device. The keyboard is a great size and it fits perfectly in my hand. The keyboard is good with a qwerty layout, reasonable sized keys and good tactile feedback. The keyboard is a QWERTY keyboard, making it easy for me to type out my text. The keyboard is nice, though my big fingers had some issue hitting the right letter at times.You have the ability to use icons with this label maker, which is the first time I've seen this feature. I can only assume this was done to keep the keyboard 'clean' and the alpha characters easily noticeable. The keyboard is actually a good one. I have an older Brother Ptouch that has a more traditionally scaled down QWERTY keyboard layout, still keeping to general proportions of an actual computer keyboard, but that makes it sit wide in the hand. The Dymo I can literally use walking around, but the keyboard dimensions slow me down by some small increment. The QWERTY keyboard is nice, and it's very easy to use. I really do not care if it is a QUERTY keyboard just for making a few labels here or there. I like the full QWERTY keyboard. QWERTY keyboard is nice and fairly easy to use. The QWERTY keyboard has no spaces between each keys. It has a nice QWERTY keyboard, which I can type easily enough.6.
