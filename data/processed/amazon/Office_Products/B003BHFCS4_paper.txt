Removing from paper did not damage the paper nor remove any of the ink underneath.Surprisingly, the label withstood water. The paper is a bit thicker than the regular Post-It notes too. The paper used in the tape is thicker and more durable than regular Post-It paper. So while they stick great to paper, plastic is another story. It does what's it suppose to for paper. I'm able to peel them up (off paper or wood surfaces) without leaving any residue on the surface. Other than paper, the labels peels off easily from most surfaces. I don't recommend them for labeling paper products however unless the labeling is intended to be permanent - otherwise you run the risk of causing damage upon removal.

They are relatively stiff paper; I doubt they will work very well on any surface that is itself flexible, such as a plastic bag.All in all, I find this to be a useful addition to my arsenal of Post-It products and reasonably priced for a 700 inch roll.

It works fine, but it leaves the paper with a jagged end.

*The paper texture is a bit easier to write on than the Painter's tape*The slightly wider width is nice*The bright color makes for easier readingSo I would say that, on balance, this is like the Painter's tape we've been using for years, but now perfected!There is only 1 problem: the price.
