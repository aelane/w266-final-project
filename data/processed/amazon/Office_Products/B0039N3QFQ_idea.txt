I liked the idea that you can have this on your desk taking up very little space. It's a nifty idea, and I was a bit skeptical at first, but I think it works fine. Great idea, works good, very, very convenient. They are idea for small jobs like envelopes and paper. The idea for this Deskgrip tape dispenser seemed as if it was something I would get a lot of use from. This is an interesting idea, but if the dispenser will not remain still for me to quickly pull out the tape piece, as instructed, and I have to use either two fingers or my other hand to keep the dispenser still, then I would imagine I might become frustrated when trying to use it for wrapping gifts. I like the idea of dispensers, they give you little bits of tape VS having to worry about pulling off some exact amount. I love the idea of this  Pop-Up Tape Deskgrip Despenser. I liked the idea of this tape dispenser, and I thought it would be a very useful tool in my life, as I use scotch tape every day. My idea was that it would sit out on my desk, but I quickly realized that wasn't very practical. That a great idea in my book. The idea of the pop-up tape is good and it is convienent to be able to quickly to get a piece of the tape. I suppose the idea is that you have this gizmo stuck down on your desk, and when you want a short strip of sticky tape you just pull one out. I got this because it seems like a great idea. Overall, this is a great idea, although it was slightly confusing to get it set up at first and does not grip as well as I'd like it to, it serves its purpose well and hopefully with future versions of this, it will only get better. It is a nice idea, but it doesn't always work.Yet since grabbing a piece of tape is an easy one handed affair now because of the device, one can use the pinky or middle finger of the pulling hand to secure the Deskgrip dispenser to the desk or whatever.It's cheap enough too. This "Scotch Pop-up Tape Refillable Deskgrip Dispenser" is a good idea.
