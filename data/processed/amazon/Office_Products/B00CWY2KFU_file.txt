I like that we can just put them in a file and go. I like the file folder in front that is accessible from two sides, and it's holding up to being carried and zipped and unzipped many times. The file folders are made of a thin plastic and since that is a major feature for me, I am hoping that with gentlle use and not overstuffing them, I will be able to use and appreciate this binder for quite sometime.It's not the most expensive looking binder from the outside, but that is a minor issue, if it holds up, I will be a very happy camper. Each file organizer can be securely fastened separately from everything else so you don't have to worry about your files falling out if you accidentally drop the binder while the main compartment is open. Having both 6 file folders and an 800 sheet capacity ring is great.My only reservations are (1) if one really put as much stuff in this binder as it will hold, would it be able to support the weight, carried around day after day? The 6 file folders keep extra pages  nicely in order, and there is plenty of room for more as the projects grow. The file folder section is accessible from the outside or inside if you have binder open,. The file folder section is roomy enough for my wife's iPad with the flip cover on it. The file section has 5 built-in dividers, i.e., 6 file sections which is very useful for organizing stuff. This file is accessible from the inside or outside of the folder. I would gladly sacrifice some of the file space for an empty pouch to stick folders or a notebook, maybe some supplies. It is also large enough to accommodate US standard-size file folders. The exterior expanding file pocket is designed for access from both inside and outside.

But the separate file pocket doesn't hold just a few papers securely, except for zippering closed.

The file folder is internal, but it is easily accessible from either the inside, or the outside, of the zipper binder.I have only one suggestion that would have allowed for me to give this product 5 stars instead of 4.

The attached file holders allows for easy storage of loose papers.
