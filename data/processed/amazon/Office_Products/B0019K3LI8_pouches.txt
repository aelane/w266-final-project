These pouches work great. The pouches and the laminator are really easy to use and they produce a great result. I keep coming back to these pouches and I can't find a better price. I have found that these pouches always hold up. I love these pouches. These pouches are easy to open and use with my Scotch laminator - just find the end, open it up, stick in whatever you need to be laminated and then feed through the machine. These are the 3mm pouches which are great for most home laminating projects (i.e. The pouches are large enough to laminate more than one item is most cases. Because I have so many pouches I end up laminating things I did not plan on laminating, but that's okay. Plus you get 100 pouches in this pack. These pouches are easy to use very durable and gives a professional look. The pouches I bought before were sticky enough inside to keep stuff from slipping around. I love these laminating pouches. I can use it whenever I need and the 3mm pouches are plenty rigid. These pouches are very nicely priced for how many you get and the quality of the pouches. They are 3 mil pouches and they seal very well, crystal clear and very shiny.If you're a crafter, they make a good way to protect non-dimensional paper art, to make custom dry erase boards as gifts or for yourself, or to protect recipe cards. These pouches work perfect and are so crystal clear. These pouches are just what I need for my laminating project. When I opened them, I thought these pouches seemed awfully thick for 3 mil plastic, so I went to the Scotch website and looked up the product number and according to the description on the manufacturer website, THESE ARE 5 MIL THICK.These are great for laminating an entire 8 1/2 x 11 inch page, or combining multiple smaller items and then cutting them apart. As tough as these pouches are, the Scotch website says they are "Photo Safe", so I assume that means you can laminate photographs without harming them, which you can't do with all laminating pouches.At the price I paid for them here on Amazon (about 75% less than at a brick and mortar store) these pouches are great value. We are very satisfied with the pouches. They are excellent and I've used these laminating pouches to laminate my child's school projects, photographs, certificates, and documents.
