These labels are great, had no problems in my laser printer but they are definitely permanent. I am happy with these labels. these little labels print beautifully with my ink jet printers, but they are an odd, really small size and there is no standard setup for them in the programs I use, so I had to manually format for printing. These labels work perfectly and are very convenient. Even though they are return labels, they can be used for other things - their usage is very flexible.They can be used with the computer or without.I love being organized. Once these labels are put on a paper envelope, they are staying there. Placing the labels on a shiny surface, such as the packaging the labels came in or on a CD case, results in being able to peel off the label, but in my opinion, this is okay.2. These are very good labels. Definitely recommend these over the standard labels we have all been using for years....they have finally made them easier to use. These small labels are perfect! Incredibly bright labels. Text printed on these labels looks bold and bright. These labels do all that they promise to. The 3M labels all made it back to me instantly. These little labels are ideal. Just like the other 3M permanent labels, they stick well, but not "permanent."4. With my HP Officejet K5400, it wasn't accurate enough to print exactly in the small labels. The labels are what you expect, stick well, come on a good quality transport sheet for printing and work very well in both ink jet and laser printers. You can also print labels directly from MS Word. You can print over two labels if you need to, but buying the right size will help. I gave some other 3M labels not-so-stellar reviews, but these return address labels are great. On the larger labels, the not-so-sticky "permanent adhesive" was not so impressive, but for tiny return address labels on envelopes, it is fine. All the labels seem to use the same adhesive and paper, and it just seems to be designed for small return address labels and doesn't "extend" to the larger ones very well. These labels are really an improvement over others of similar style and size. The labels can be used for address labels as well as return labels and for file folder labels as well.Like other users I did not pay attention to the size of the labels and as a result they are a bit small for many applications but that is my fault. These labels work very well for their intended purposes and are competatively priced with other labels that are not as durable or versatile in their applications. I also do not need 2000 labels at a time. I like that Post-it and 3M put more than 100 labels in their packages but for my needs 2000 is way too many, I'll never use them all. These labels make the work painless, saving the headaches of printing on envelopes that can jam in the printer. I will continue to use 3M labels in the future, the quality of the sticker backing and paper seem to adhere to the envelopes better than the generics do. These small labels are perfect for an unobtrusive return address.I visited the 3m website to download the correct template (to ensure I printed labels that fit the label sheets), easily found the template, and customized it in MS Word without an issue. These labels are great, quick lift is not a gimmick it really works.Still the adhesive is super strong, adheres to the backing as the sheets are fed through the printer, no curling.And when the labels are placed on the the target they adhere securely.Finally the labels match up perfectly with word templates.Highly recommended, give them a try. These are great labels, really easy to use. 3M Permanent Adhesive Shipping Labels are labels that you can print out from your laser printer to make self labeling as easy as peeling off a sticker!! I had some Avery labels left and was able to compare the two products. These are great labels and the size of the package is wonderful. Aren't always running out of labels in the middle of a big job. These 3M labels are great! The labels are easy to remove from the page because the border edges are already removed from the wax paper. I would definitely recommend these labels for home or office use. They stick very well and are inexpensive as labels go. I've used these labels for just about everything. I'm happy with all their labels. These labels come at a rather low cost and worked really well with my laser printer. These labels work with standard Avery template (4167). These are excellent labels. The labels are 1/2" x 1-3/4" Inches White, and the labels can be used with a laser or ink jet printer. There are 2,000 labels per package; 25 sheets-80 labels per sheet.The labels arrived nicely packaged inside of a cardboard type envelope. The labels are bright white in color and have a good amount of stick to them. They're labels. These labels use the Avery templates and are very easy to peel off. 3M labels won't go down in history as the greatest technological achievements of all time; but they do what scores of office products claim but don't deliver on: reduce the 'embroilment' factor when to the office workflow. Although these labels are *VERY* small - check the size first to make sure these are what you want - I had no problems with alignment. There are 2000 labels in this pack so I would guess this is more cost effective that buying preprinted sets. If you need labels, look no further. Usually I use the Avery Brand of shipping labels, and when these came I was so excited to see that they have printed the compatible Avery label number right on each sheet. These particular labels correspond to Avery 5667. The labels come off easily and adhere like iron.Trust the name and enjoy the product.Jay Adler What's so great about labels that warrant them having their own Amazon review?Honestly, not much. I mistakenly ordered labels for a laser printer when I have an ink jet printer. However, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that these labels work just fine in my ink jet printer with no smearing or printing problems. However, these labels are so tiny -- 80 labels per sheet -- that I can only fit two lines of print on them. They are good labels but are so small that they have very limited uses. These are labels designed to be used in laser and inkjet printers. The labels seemed more likely to peel off easily in the printing process, and I was unwilling to risk wasting my time on a printer jam.The paper surface of the labels seems okay, and held writing in ink and permanent marker as well as any such label I have used.These are not labels which I will use again. These labels worked well for me. These labels are just fine. These labels not only work well in a laser printer--which can be tricky--to create professional looking mailing labels, they are useful for labeling plastic storage boxes--other brands peel off so easily. They are 2000 labels per pack, which is a lot more than I had expected, so one pack goes a long way. I'm really impressed with these labels, and can't find any negatives at all. The labels themselves are nice, much stickier than the Avery labels I used previously, no curling corners!! I use mailing labels and specialty printing paper on a weekly basis, running two at small businesses at home. Avery labels being my #1 choice. I find these labels to be a tad small for my purposes but I find them excellent for covering  errors in labeling as well as any shipping marks on a box that I'm reusing.Good quality, good stickability, nothing to complain about. The labels are 1/2" x 1 3/4" - very small and likely appropriate for a business that is looking to print their own labels for mass mailings as you receive 2,000 labels in the pack. Since the labels are so small, don't expect to be able to use them for other tasks (i.e. The 3M labels premium quality labels, though you may not notice it with casual or infrequent use.The first thing that jumps out about these labels is that they're extremely easy to remove. I was squeamish to try these labels because I never can get any labels to properly line up in my printer (cheap HP Deskjet 3915) but after about 3 sheets of trying I got them to print and line up very nicely! And they come 80 labels per sheet and 25 sheets per pack so that's a lot of return address labels. These labels are fantastic. These labels feed through my printer well and easily. These are great labels, they came out looking great in my crappy old inkjet printer and are easy to peel with the sections between the labels already removed. "I used these labels with my inkjet printer, and even though it's listed for laser printers, they printed just fine once I found the corresponding template in Word.In conclusion, these are great at what they're meant for--return address labels--but they're even better because they're perfect as multi-use labels as well! These labels are really small. I needed labels thhat wouldn't peel off, even when it's hot or with drastic temp changes. There may not be much you can say about Return Address Labels, but these are great labels. Although these particular labels will work as return address labels, I've been using them for file folder labels. These labels work just as expected. And as with all 3M labels, there are templates available online at [...].My only complaint is that they are smaller than I expected. These are currently less expensive than the Avery labels of the same size. I think they're stickier too, but the Avery labels I have to compare are a couple years old.Unlike labels from a couple years ago, there are strips on the page where there is only backing. This makes it much easier to remove individual labels from the sheets.These are for laser printers. They're not so amazing that you should throw away your old labels and get these immediately. But they are good labels at a good price. You get 2000 labels. These are great labels with the quick lift tabs that make the labels easy to use. These labels adhere to surfaces and there is no fear of them falling off. These labels are everything they claim to be. These labels are made from quality paper and really adhere to many surfaces. They are much too small for shipping labels (in fact they are just barely large enough for return labels!).
