I didn't like that the ink cartridges were a little tricky to install. You'd be surprised at the ink you save with the draft mode setting. Its an ink pig as most cheap printers are, and it prints slow when compared to higher end printers in the epson, canon, and hp line. It is suppose to be efficient on ink so we will monitor and see. It also runs through the ink cartridges rather quickly, compared with an older Epson I have as well as my Canon workhorse all-in-one. I just hate to throw away unused ink just because one color runs out first, most always blue it seems. That much ink got me about 60 pages of print. The ink will come from Amazon, at least for now. Use 4 separate ink cartridges.3. Next you load the ink cartridges and put paper in the printer. use ink like it's free, which of course it isn't, and they use ti because it is the money product for printer manufacturers.The XP-400 is no different. At first I thought the ink was way overpriced but after installing new purchased ink, it is lasting much longer & I have no complaints. My ink use so far:8-22 started using printer.9-14 need black ink (ink sent with printer lasted 3 weeks).9-26 replaced yellow ink.10-22 have not replaced any ink since 9-26.-The printer is easy to set up & easy to use (except for already mentioned wireless issues).-Doesn't take up a lot of space.If you do not have to print out labels or something similar, I highly recommend this little printer. It was difficult just getting it to stop telling me to replace the ink cartridges, or even recognize them. The ink cartridges included are starter versions that don't have the capacity of the normal cartridge. No more running out of ink when I need it most. I especially like the separate ink tanks so you only replace what you actually have used. I plan to try refilled ink cartridges but since the printer is so new, I don't they are widely available yet. Kodak wanted me to pay for new ink and print head to fix their problem, not anymore, I'm an Epson printer fan now. Setup involved installing the 4 ink cartridges, running the cd and updating some drivers. * Black ink cartridge same size as colorVerdict: decent printer, midrange printer quality, easy to use and setup. Saving ink is not worth the illegibility of draft-mode print-outs. *  The ink cartridges are relatively cheap for an inkjet printer of this kind. I rather like the old ink cartridges that were a decent size and would go on forever. The ink cartridges appear to be the same, so that was a deciding factor on buying this model printer.

It will direct you to install the ink cartridges (included).

I found that the ink lasts much longer than my old Pixma (which seemed to eat ink like mad) and the cartridges cost less than many other brands I've used before.

The ink cartridges on Epson dot com range from $8.99 single color to 12.99 for black ink.
