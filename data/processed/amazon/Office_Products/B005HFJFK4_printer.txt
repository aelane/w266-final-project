Alternatively, most of printer's services, at least the ones that really matter can be controlled from any third-party app through the installed driver or the specialized apps installed off the Epson CD.The 2-tray claim is technically correct but in practice there is ONE paper tray plus a 'photo tray' on top of it that can hold up to 20 4x6" or 5x7" photo sheets. The printer's front has ports for USB and SD memory cards. The printer has the ability to direct the output to a PC on the network and even launch the default email application. The printer's ability to 'make' black ink out of colored ink when it ran out of black is as definite plus.For a 'home all-in-one' AND photo printer with the ability to serve a small business well, this is a five-star.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! This my second printer from Epson, having previously gotten the WorkForce 840 All-in-One. I never thought I'd see a better printer than the WorkForce, and then the Artisan 837 arrived at my door. Overall, this printer offers convenience and quality in an easy to use package. Can't explain why.That being said, this might be the best bang-for-your-buck printer in the past 30 years. This is my favorite printer by far.Set up was incredibly easy. This is a great printer and it came well packaged. The printer it will automatically save the last PC you scan something to and then you can continue to scan from the printer to that PC without going to the PC which saves a lot of time. This new printer though, the Epson Artisan 837, is terrific.Setup was easy but not flawless -- there were a few confusing steps, but within 20-30 minutes I was not only printing from my computer but from my iPad as well. The printer is fast and runs quietly. The older Epson printer I had just ate up ink cartridges, but I haven't had this one long enough to know whether it's any better. With the older printer I had to wait to print when I started it up from resting -- maybe just 3-5 seconds, but it seemed longer; this printer, when you open up the cover, is ready to go immediately. I'm very satisfied with this printer. I have been using my printer for a few weeks now and I love it! Excellent printer! This printer uses six of the 99 size which are easy able obtainable at the office supply store or on the internet. This replaced my previous printer, and HP Photosmart All-In-One -- aside from a weird technical/network challenge which I had to work through (and will address below), I love this printer and am happy with the switch.PROS:- Network-enabled printing. The printer was on, and said it was connected, but my computer couldn't detect it on the Wifi network. This printer prints directly on DVD's and Blu-rays beautifully. The printer comes with CD printing software, which I took the template I designed in Photoshop and placed it on the CD template to print. The printer turned itself on. It's a very large and bulky printer. I have an all-in-one HP printer and the ink is about $30.I don't use the fax machine so I cannot comment on that.Update: One thing I have found is that the paper gets jammed a lot and sometimes will print out multiple sheets per page. A very smart printer and so user friendly.Installing cartridges was super easy...there are 6 of them.There's a touch screen control panel that is super responsive, clear and user friendly.There's a separate section for smaller photo paper (4x6 and 5x7), which I love because you don't have to remove the 8x11 paper to print photos.Printer is heavier than what I'm used to and larger, but it still fit comfortably on my small printer stand, but be careful to check the measurements if your stand is small. The printer is solid and well made, and extremely nice looking.The entire printer is enclosed to keep dust out of your printer. I highly recommend this printer. It's not a great printer when it comes to black ink use - the cartridge is small and priced higher than other black inks when you compute the cost per ml. The printer will not function when one of the cartridges is empty.This is not the best choice if you  plan on using your all in one for a lot of B/W tasks (e.g., mainly for faxing and B/W copies). I am very impressed with this printer on a number of levels. This printer is very quiet.The print quality and color matching are top notch. This printer is holding up extremely well and the only thing I have had to do is add more ink because we use it so often! Dead-on-arrival printer sits in my office repacked in its original box and will go in the dumpster since Amazon said they do not want it back. Welps, I can't use my printer at all to even print pure black and white, nor use the copier to copy some b&w; documents I need to send out today! Why can't I use the printer even if I am only using black ink?? This is the first printer I've owned that requires color ink cartridges to contain ink to only use the black-ink; I know my old Canon and HP didn't have that problem. On the HP, you get a printer error and if you have the HP Monitor software installed, it tells you it can't print because you need to open the paper output tray. This Epson printer is really great! Having the printer, copier, scanner and fax in one unit is obviously a huge space saver. This printer installed quickly on my home network. Because this printer has a built in CD-ROM printer, I was able to print authentic looking CD-ROMs, like the ones you purchase in the store.My only complaint is the ink cartridges are kind of small, but so far they've lasted for quite a few prints. I have owned this printer for probably a year. *I think this printer whistle (make a sound) out of nowhere, can't confirm it yet. The Epson Artisan 837 Color Inkjet Wireless All-In-One is easily the best printer I have ever owned. The printer did not come with a USB cable but if you're like me, you have a few of those lying around. The printer uses  6 Claria hi-definition ink cartridges in black, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Light Cyan and Light Magenta. You won't need another printer because this one can do it all - print, copy, scan, fax, and of course, photo. This is such a great printer - it's compact and has a nice, bright touch-screen. I love that this printer does it all - prints, copies, faxes. this printer is remarkable. This printer is great! This printer used with the correct paper produce better photos than you will get at a typical photo lab. I downloaded a free, Open Source Gutenprint printer driver. As a printer, it fits nicely into the Epson brand. I've used several different printer brands and my experience has been that Epson products produce the best color reproduction with the fewest problems.I've read a lot of reviews here endorsing HP products, but I've found the color matching and performance of HP's products to be utterly sub standard if you're looking to print high quality photographs. This printer does that for a better price. Like the Canon, this is a six-color printer, only here it's  regular cyan and light cyan, regular magenta and light magenta, yellow, and black mix. I've had this printer almost a year now and it is my favorite printer, I absolutely love it and still do. This printer is not only a printer, but a fax, copier, scanner, and wireless printer- including photos and printing directly from your smartphone or tablet - very versatile! This is the best printer we had to date, and we have had it over a year and I don't see that changing anytime soon. This is one very impressive printer. Once I had the printer up, the instructions said, insert the system disk. I did this, and then tried to add the printer to the Mac. It tells me "Software for this printer is available from Apple. Please contact the printer's manufacturer for the latest software." Then I tried to add the printer... and once again, the process failed. )So as a Windows printer, it's fantastic- but pricey to run. As a Mac printer, ditto- but make sure you don't use the disk. I have never owned a printer that was not an HP but the hype for this printer was fabulous. I have never had a printer with a separate tray area for picture paper. The printer is a lot faster than my HP and I will save energy because I can turn it on and off without having to wait so long for it to shut down or start up. !UPDATEI totally love this printer. I'm just so happy with this printer. This is my fifth Epson printer, and one of the three that I am currently using. Right after the second one came out of the printer the greens looked a tiny bit deeper but when the ink totally dried they were pretty close to being identical. I did that with my last printer, and did NOT do it with this one. In short, I'd give this printer six stars if I could! This printer is no exception and is by far the best Epson printer I've owned.Setting up the printer was very easy: the worst part for me was getting it out of the box. The printer is well protected inside of the box to the point of feeling like it wasn't going to ever come out. I did install the printer drivers on my Macbook running OS X Lion without any issues (I first checked the website for drivers and didn't use the included CD just in case since vendors seem to be iffy on Lion support.) This is a nice printer, especially for printing pictures, but it goes through ink and replacement ink is pretty spendy.Installation was fairly easy, I was able to do it on my own and I'm not someone who likes to set up electronics. I'm pretty impressed with this printer--with one big exception. Not terrible, but this is a wireless printer so it could be anywhere in relation to the computer.All in all, I'd say take the "artisan" name seriously. This is a printer for doing fancy stuff like photos and discs. This printer is no exception. To top it off, it functions beautifully as a printer for everyday use aside from printing photos. Alas, an all-in-one printer for any home or small office; this machine truly does it all! The printer shoots the paper out faster than the tray can contain. This printer replaced a 6 year old HP printer/scanner/copier. This printer prints out everything I've done so incredibly fast, that at first I thought it must be messing up! It was imperative that this printer would not get messed up by printing the off-sized sheet, and that it would not have trouble loading the label sheets so it could print properly. Over all a very nice printer, with good color. What I will say is that this printer does in fact REALLY DO ALL THE THINGS IT SAYS IT DOES!The prints are as good or better than the prints I get from Sam's Club or Fuji. If you want a very nice, small but very pretty all-in-one printer that makes lab quality photos quickly, this is your dream printer. For setting up the printer with my wireless network, I gave it the "dad test," and had my dad attempt to get it working with the network. And if you only have need of a printer and not the other options, you still can't go wrong with the Epson 837 given all of the features you are getting at such a reasonable price.Update April 2012: If you don't mind spending a little bit more and having a bigger printer, I would recommend purchasing theEpson WorkForce Pro WP-4540 Color Inkjet Wireless All-In-One with Fax and 580 Sheet Paper Capacity (C11CB32201)over the 837. The artisan 837 is a sleek personal printer for a home office, intended for those who want a multi-function printer that scans, faxes, prints, prints cd's and processes photos, all on one device. Unplugged printer to reset.

This is the best printer that I've ever owned.

The printer stops printing when any one of the cartridges runs dry and that inevitably happens Thursday at 11:30pm when the kid's trying to print out her homework.Connectivity - Both wireless (802.11 b/g/n certified) and wired networking is supported, although you can only use one at a time.

If you're going to be using the printer wirelessly, plan on initially use a wired connection to get it configured...you can do it through the front panel, but it's a lot more button pushes.
