When it comes to hanging file folders, there isn't too much to be said. These are very strong and sturdy hanging file folders. I hate it when hanging file folders fall apart (where the strip of metal falls out). These hanging file folders are pretty much the same as my old ones, nothing remarkable about how they are constructed. I've used hanging file folders for business and home office use for years, and I am horrible about using the insert-able plastic tabs that go with the standard hanging folders.These FasTab folder are nice in that the tab is built-in so that you can write directly onto the tab. Many of our file folders were bursting at the seams, and these expansion folders worked perfectly to store our extra large collections of subject matter. And similarly, when I use a 8 1/2 by 11 file folder inside this expansion folder it's slightly snug. I really like these file folders. There are colorful hanging file folders, made of stiff cardboard and of reasonable quality. These hanging file folders are very effective for their stated purpose. Unlike many hanging file folders, these have a tab on them for labeling. These file folders with built-in paper tabs would be perfect for those file cabinets that get the rough and tumble treatment, for example on the manufacturing floor. These are nice looking file folders. These file folders are strong and have well-designed tabs for labeling/writing at the top. If you need hanging file folders for standard dimension papers (8.5 x 11") that will last and not rip easily these seem like a good choice. Like file folders, the tabs are built in & easy to write on sticker labels (no need to deal with plastic tabs like hanging folders). These are very sturdy hanging file folders. I like these file folders a lot. However, they're not quite what I thought they'd be -- they are flat when they arrive, and actually are almost exactly like regular hanging file folders. These hanging file folders are awesome! Once expanded they will fit into a standard file cabinet. In the past, I had the original green file folders which were sturdy but not very stylish.Pendaflex: I loved these right away since they have an easy access opening, which I plan on cutting Smead's container the same way. These file folders have the benefit of allowing you to write on the tabs. Smead's FasTab hanging file folders are both beautiful and functional.

You cannot place a file folder into it as the fit is too tight.--there are staggered 1/3 cut tabs built in at the top, but there are no slits into which to place those plastic label holders.--the material of which they are made is a board considerably thicker and sturdier than that used for standard file folders or standard file slings.

This is a very nice hanging file.
