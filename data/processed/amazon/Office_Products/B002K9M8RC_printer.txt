They can be used through the printer and they handily can be stuck on. They go through the printer well. I also like that you could put them in the printer if you had to print multiple labels at once. My Epson R800 printer is very picky about the thickness and grip of the paper. So if you have a finicky printer feed mechanism, these labels feed just like normal paper. It went through the printer well and stuck to the folders. They worked with my printer and they stuck to the folders. These don't come loose in the printer or on the file folder and they peel reasonably easy too.

Every printer is different, and you will need to rely on your personal experience to guide you.3M File Folder Labels with Permanent Adhesive are designed to be stuck once and never removed.

It also seemed to work well in the printer.

They are laid out so you can use a printer, but I'll probably just write on them.
