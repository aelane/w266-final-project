Sure enough, at least so far, this sharpener really seems to do the trick. This heavy-duty sharpener from Westcott did just the trick. Still, this is a really great sharpener. This is really steep for a sharpener, but you get what you pay for I guess, and for the most part this is top quality! The sharpener has a nice big compartment for shavings, easily emptied. The sharpener does seem pretty substantial, so maybe it will actually last that long.On the con side, the sharpener is a bit bulky and a bit noisy, and maybe one pencil in twenty or thirty might come out a bit uneven. Still, I really am impressed with this sharpener. Our old sharpener had just gotten dull over several years' use and I could end-up grinding down half of the pencil before I'd get a good point. I couldn't do that with my old sharpener. The last sharpener I tried you had to turn the pencil as it sharpened or one side wouldn't get sharpened.This sharpener doesn't have that problem. It is supposed to stop the sharpener once the tip is sharp. By 'not all-purpose' I mean that this sharpener is quick, makes a nice point, doesn't easily jam, but is limited to #2 pencils. The sharpener has an opening with six adjustable holes that should fit most pencils. The sharpener does a terrific job with our pencils. After using this electric sharpener with a variety of writing pencils and colored pencils, I found little to criticize. My trusted old sharpener just wasn't doing it's job, so several months ago I bought a new sharpener. Westcott has designed a very useful and sleek sharpener. This sharpener has a neat dial which allows you to adjust the size meant for your pencil. It's truly a great sharpener for a classroom or office use so well worth the money. This sharpener actually happens to live up to all of the claims made on the product page, and exceeds my general expectations for a standard electric pencil sharpener, without an exorbitant price!I LOVE the fact that this pencil sharpener really IS quieter than the standard electric number! With this sharpener, I think that problem is solved! This sharpener really is MUCH quieter than the standard, and it's not a distracting noise at all! Another Westcott sharpener that I got recently - theWestcott Axis iPoint Evolution Electric Pencil Sharpener for Home or Office (15510)- CLAIMS on the product page that it will sharpen multiple sizes of pencils, but I have no idea how Westcott's product blurb writers got it so mixed up when there's no dial on that one to change hole sizes, and only the single hole to accommodate nothing but standard sized pencils. This sharpener also DOES cut off (for the most part...) when the point is fully sharpened. We've already filled up this sharpener with pencil shavings. Very happy with this sharpener. :-)All in all, a good sharpener. I also loved that this sharpener will sharpen 6 different size pencils (up to 11 mm in diameter) by simply turning a dial at the top. I looked around and saw this sharpener go for $85.91 and as low as $38.82 so the $36 price tag is great buy. The sharpener only fits standard-size pencils and does not have the auto shutoff when the pencil is at the perfect point. Overall, great sharpener for the price. My previous sharpener had two main flaws: It would break some pencils, and it would sharpen others &#34;crooked&#34; (where one side of the tip would end up more exposed than the other). What I like most about this sharpener is that it it sharpens a pencil and then stops. )Overall this is a great sharpener for use at home or a small office. I tested this excellent sharpener with 16 pencils and compared it to our current favorite: the Carl Angel-5 manual sharpener (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005D7S9P8/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1).Pluses of the Westcott:+ AC cord+ Very powerful+ Pretty quiet+ Great job sharpening+ Selectable size support for different pencilsMinuses:-It's BIG! This sharpener carries a steep list price, but amazon offers it at around 40% off list. We have an old sharpener that has worked for a few years, but this one looks so much newer and nicer. This sharpener is incredibly fast - the pencil goes in and it is sharp. With the old sharpener students would push hard to try to force faster sharpening which required the teacher to carefully monitor its use to avoid over loading the motor. With this sharpener, sharpening happens so fast that the students don't have a chance to damage it. We find that overall this sharpener works much better than several other electric sharpeners that we have tried where the pencil tips seem to break as they are being sharpened. Emptying the sharpener is a breeze - just remove the plastic holder on the bottom and slide it back onto the sharpener. The sharpener is even sleek looking - everything I could want in an electric pencil sharpener.
