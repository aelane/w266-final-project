As for being removable - I was able to easily peel off a label after applying and stick it in another spot without trouble. If I want a vegetable I look for a green label, if I want meat, I look for a pink label, and fish is a green label. Each label was accounted for, and held fast in the notebook even after being stuck on an item all day with handling. That makes a neater label and it won't smudge. As a temporary label they are wonderful. For a removable label I am impressed at how well they stick, even to slick flexible plastic file portfolios securely and still be able to reuse and relabel the file when needed. The label was crisp in the lettering. I picked a 5163 label pages. When you're done, print a label on plain paper. I can peel off a label without damaging the box, and with the super-bright colors, easily color-code contents. I haven't used one particularly label over a ton, but I assume it will hold up like my other "super sticky" products. The label came off easily and left no residue.

I also removed the label several times from the tub and it remained sticky enough to stay on the tub when put in place again.

I've moved one label from a metal cabinet, to a binder, to my laminate desk.

So far the label is still sticking, keeping in mind these are relatively clean surfaces but not spotless.
