I bought the Epson V500 Perfection scanner because of Epson's supposed quality. I use the scanner mostly as a copying machine so no big deal. The Epson V500 Photo scanner is an extremely nice unit. Once you have done that the scanner can be attached to the computer via a USB line. This was the scanner she had bought for home use.Figuring that anyone who did this professionally would be able to steer me to the best tool to buy for home use, I'm happy to say she was right.I have a great multi-function printer at home, that has a flat bed scanner, but you can't use those to do negatives and slides. This scanner has an attachment that allows you to set in 4 slides at once, to prescan, then you do your final scan to create the file. I have this scanner, sitting on my desk, so it is convenient to use. The scanner itself is not that much bigger than it's maximum size scan, so it does not take up much room.QUICK SWAP OUT OF WHITE BACKING MAKE IT EASY TO CHANGE FORMATSThis scanner comes with the plastic parts that set in the scanner to hold slides and film. When I scanned them the scanner took these negatives and converted them to the positives that prints could be made from, or pictures that could be used in stuff like photo books. This scanner fit the bill nicely and has lead me to use it for a variety of other items. The scanner was easy to hook up and started up just fine. I'm sorry, but a brand-new scanner should work properly right out of the box and not need immediate service. This scanner does a very nice job. I would not buy a less expensive Epson scanner than the v500 for my use. The scanner works well but a little noisy and the software is OK but I like the Canon Scanners and Software better. We've had this scanner in our Disney World office for a few months now and it has worked out well. But first: putting it together.It's fairly easy to set up the scanner. The scanner comes with two holder plates, and you can do 35mm film negatives and slides on one plate, and medium film on the other. This scanner says it does so much! The scanner does a really nice job scanning the good and not scanning the crud and dust. I simply wanted a scanner to scan some 35mm slides and this "barely" did the job. I was eager to try out this scanner. Since then I have used my Canonscan mainly as a flatbed scanner, although occasionally I need to convert a few negatives, for other people or when we use a disposable camera.I set it up on a Dell Dimension 8100 on an external powered usb port. You do not have to wait for the scanner to warm up, great for a quicker scanning of a couple documents.The Epson is much more intuitive.

Initially I was disappointed in this scanner.

I own a Canon scanner and the software is *far* worse *and* the image quality sucks, so Epson wins by default: Marginal Software and excellent image quality seem to be a winning combination.

I primarily picked up this scanner because I want to digitize my photos via their negatives.
