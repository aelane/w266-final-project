This is a tough, sturdy plastic holder with which to display photos or any paperwork you need to display.Mounting is easy.It is a good quality, durable product.I'd recommend this to anyone needing to display and preserve paperwork or photographs. The clear plastic shows off the pictures well while protecting them. I picked this plastic display pocket up for one of my daughters award certificates. This clear Display is well made hard plastic will not fold or lose the shape, easy to use and maintain, very useful and it does what it is supposed to do, I like it a lot. The plastic pocket itself is thick and feels high-quality, although, of course, no one is going to mistake it for an expensive thin-bezel frame! It is a nice rigid plastic frame for displaying certificates and the like. The plastic is pretty sturdy and should protect whatever you put in it.My only complaint is there should be at least 3 in the package for the price. It's hard clear plastic, so it keeps the sheet neat and flat, looks professional, and hangs easily. This solid plastic display pocket is designed to be mounted on a smooth surface from which it could be easily removed when desired. It's a single clear plastic pocket for inserting an 8.5 x 11" document (larger won't fit, much smaller would look awkward). The plastic is thick and interlocking fasteners (like a "light duty" form of "Velcro") are provided for mounting on a wall (or other surface).The price seems rather high for a single display pocket, but I don't know if any better priced alternative exists.If you follow the instructions, you'll want to plan ahead. This plastic pocket is designed to attach to walls and cubicles. Interestingly enough, the plastic "finger" side of the devices is released from the mounting surface by pulling on a tab to stretch the device, much like some sticky-gum type fasteners.The pocket itself is not hard plastic, but is thicker and stiffer than most of the really cheap items in this category. The plastic seems of reasonable quality, and should out-last most of the cheaper products in this arena. The durable plastic sleeve is completely transparent. Stronger plastic than a report cover sheet, but not as hard as acrylic. This plastic pocket is great for displaying and protecting school projects and awards. The plastic protects documents or kid's drawings well, is completely transparent, and pages are easily placed in and removed from the sleeve. I really like my new 9 x 11 plus clear plastic Scotch Display Pocket. I use this Scotch plastic pocket to display my daughter's artwork. It looks like it's in a plastic pocket when it's in there, there's no design to the border of the pocket or anything.

The plastic is really thick, and isn't flimsy like photograph pockets and will offer quite a bit of protection.I had one of my daughter's pictures from when she was 10 that I was wanting to save, because it was very special and I also have certificates from time to time that I like to frame.

This clear plastic sleeve is a nice, in-between product.

This rigid plastic display pocket works well for displaying a child's artwork or certificate.
