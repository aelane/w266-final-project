This printer has only a single-line LCD screen, which means in practice that messages get cut off due to space limitations. Setting up the printer for Wifi was more challenging than it needed to be due to this issue. )But this printer handles the job just fine, and that's with the 600-DPI resolution, I didn't even think to try the 1200 DPI. It won't matter if you're careful, but this isn't the printer, I suspect, to put in the middle of an office where it'll be treated carelessly.I'm a Vine reviewer, and this printer was given to me to review. I connected the printer and the Windows computer using a standard USB cable. Because the printer was already "talking" WiFi, this install was also dead simple.I did have to download this driver from the Brother web site, because my version of Apple OSX (operating system) is too new. The printer can only hold four envelopes at a time; I suppose that this might be an issue for some folks.I am completely satisfied with the speed and print quality of the printer. On the older printer, you have to open the back door of the printer and flip a pair of blue plastic levers before printing on envelopes. When handling the printer, you will notice a certain flimsiness, and this is the only real complaint I have to make. A printer needs to have several access doors, and the Brother parts feel thin, cheap, and wobbly. Will the printer stand the test of time?Obviously I can't answer that question at this time. It is very similar to the printer under review, and that includes the flimsy plastic bits. Our previous printer, theBrother HL-5370DW, definitely got the most use since our business is now to a point where we easily print a full ream of paper every few days.The HL-5370DW actually worked fairly well; but, it did have some issues that were always a pain:1) It was horrible at printing envelopes. The entire printer is a depressing black color, very plain looking. Also, the tiny LCD, is not tiltable (like on my HL-4150 2-Line LCD), and if the printer does not sit low enough, you will be unable to read it. This printer's per page costs are much lower, so the total cost of ownership is also lower than most other Brother printers.I've run into two issues however, each costing one star. Both apply to Macs.The printer is often unresponsive. Setting up the printer was no trouble at all; as usual, it took more time to carefully remove the packing materials than connect it to my Wi-Fi network. This printer would be a 5 star printer EXCEPT for the fact that when starting up a print job it pulls 7 volts of power on the circuit. Setting up the printer is easy. I probably could have set this printer up somewhere else and it would have worked. If you are going to try this printer in a home office setting, I would very strongly suggest shutting down your computer before turning the printer on.
