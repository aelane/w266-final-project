The pages in the book are very thin so I was initially concerned I wouldn't be able to remove the tabs and the pages would just tear, but they came off easy. If they can be used on those thin pages, I imagine they could be used on just abut anything. Having the pages bookmarked saves time & aggravation in assigning and grading. Rigid enough to stay parallel with your pages; no limping or bending problems.2. They are large and sturdy enough to easily write on and to turn pages with. They turn pages like a divider, and are made extra thick for reliable, long-lasting use. I like to mark important pages in magazines and books for quick reference and these do the job. Ofter, I mark pages in my computer "Dummies" books for use when I have a problem with my computer or a friend asks for help. Without having to go through all the pages of the binders, she could find just what she needed instantly. I like that I don't have to waste pages in my binder for tabs, I can just use what's already there. I turned the pages of my big atlas by the tab, with all the weight of the pages piled on top, and it stayed put. They also remove easily and cleanly from pages of books and magazines. Stick it on your pages !!!! I can use them to section off pages which are of extreme importance and which I will need to re-read.I use a basic ball point pen and so far that works well. I've used them to mark pages containing information that I occasionally need refer to in my radio shack, my woodworking library, and my carving library. Using the NoteTabs, I can easily turn to specifically marked pages. I use them to bookmark pages, highlight text, and write short comments on the see through section for future use. I've been tempted to dogear pages, and tempted to make little useful checks (in pencil of course), temptations I've sometimes fallen into in times of great duress.These tabs help save me time and save the materials I'm working with. It seems I am always leafing through the pages to find the subject  I need at that time, among all the writing. I was able to stick one onto a few different pages without it losing its stickiness.
