The roll feels very smooth as you pull the tape, almost like it's greased with lubricant. This big, 38-yard roll of shipping tape is great for securing packages for mailing. It starts easily and comes off the roll neatly. I still had one roll of my old tape, and when I did a head-to-head comparison, this WAS much quieter! This roll will probably last years. It comes off the roll quietly. The roll started easy, just like it says it will and I didn't have any problems with it coming undone and sticking back to itself like you sometimes get with some packing tapes. It's easy to use and comes off the roll easily.

The roll lasted me for quite some time and it actually is a lot quieter than other rolls of packaging tape.

It comes off the roll with very little pull and doesn't make that rasping sound that is so familiar with other package sealing tapes.

It is easy to peel from itself on the roll, yet sticks very well to boxes.
