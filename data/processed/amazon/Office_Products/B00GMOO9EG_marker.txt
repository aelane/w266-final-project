The marker is also a nice touch...but I'm guess that you have one around somewhere. Also very nice is the black marker that comes with the kit--it held up well to frequent use and didn't dry out.Now, the not-so-good. The marker is a nice add-on, as is the tape - both things are needed for moving! The marker is also a nice inclusion and a necessity. The marker is good (can't have enough of them when moving) and the tape is adequate. The marker was ok, but dried up pretty quick. The marker that comes in the kit smells REALLY strongly so I ditched it in favor of using a Sharpie. The marker works, but not for long. A large black Sharpie marker is included for labeling along with a regular 55 yard roll of 1.88 inch wide, clear box sealing tape. The marker is a standard Marks-A-Lot black marker and worked fine - wasn't dried out or anything. The marker worked fine, the tape was good, but it would have been nice if the bubble wrap was in one roll instead of loose pieces. The marker is also decent.Tape: It's a good quality roll - not the really cheap stuff that wrinkles and tears, or the extra heavy type. There was also a permanent marker for writing on the box.

The marker is exactly the right kind, as is the tape.

The marker has a good sized nib to write on the boxes so they are easy to read.

After deducting $2.00 for the marker, $3.50 for a roll of tape and $3.00 for the bubble wrap (I used average prices at Amazon for the marker and tape.
