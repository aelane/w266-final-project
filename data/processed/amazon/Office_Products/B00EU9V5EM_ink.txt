And, since the ink cartridges are fairly small, I know I better stock-up on ink in advance.Yet, all-in-all, a nice printer, good price, quiet, easy setup....I like it. The ink consumption rate is again very good- probably will shock you if this is your first Epson, the ease of set up and connection to wifi is A+, communicates easily with my cell and laptop. Because of the ink issue, I wouldn't suggest it to a heavy user, but for the person who likes to print out an occasional document or photo, you can't go wrong with the XP-810. I'll be curious to see how quickly it runs down the ink. Nothing.AND if you aren't careful, the ink WILL get on your hands.The good news? The ink cartridges are small, so I think this printer is better suited to a relatively low volume use. The ink is expensive which is my only complaint about the machine. This ink does have its benefits though. It is because the Epson ink is ridiculously expensive. The ink used in the maintenance and testing cost about half the price of the printer. But since ink is a necessary part of the operation, Epson printers do not deserve 5-stars until their ink is priced somewhere near reality, and since the unit has this annoying ringing issue, I&#8217;m dropping another star. It does not, however, roll back in when it goes to sleep.Aside from the horrendous ink usage and the questionable quality of the ink cartridges themselves, I do like this printer. Not sure how long the ink cartridges last yet. Although the ink cartridges differ and this is about 1/3 smaller, it has all of the copy, print, scan, and fax features of the 830. Nevertheless, ink isn't exactly cheap.The display is more intelligent than past units and makes it easy to copy, fax, or scan directly to any computer on the network with drivers installed.

When I opened the black ink cartridge package there was already spilled ink in the package.

I have wasted many Epson ink cartridges on this printer and I still have totally blank spaces on the printed sheet.

Here's what I don't like at all: the ink cartridges use a plastic cap that you're expected to save, so that when the ink runs out you can recap the empty cartridge.Like I'm saving bits of plastic for future time.
