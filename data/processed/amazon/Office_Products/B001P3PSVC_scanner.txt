I am a heavy scanner user. I use a scanner to scan not only paperwork, but my mini quilt fabric art. This scanner did a great job on paperwork, but it did not do a good job on items that are not totally flat against the glass or don't cover the entire glass. First let me say, if you're considering this scanner, read all the specs and watch the video, and then do that for other competing ones. Love this scanner. We have been very pleased with this scanner. It is a great and affordable scanner for the techie and the novice alike. This scanner is great! This is a good scanner for the price and much better than any all in one scanner/printer can offer. I have avoided HP scanner base on the bad result of the Officejet 6110 and decided to try out other brands like Epson and Canon. First off, while this is the scanner I purchased, it is not the current Epson offering. Using my other scanner as such would not be possible. So this is a welcomed second scanner, that has become my primary. I ordered this Epson Perfection V30 scanner through Amazon.com feb 9th from Adorama they shipped it out feb 10 and I got it today feb 11 2011, it is about the size of a lap top lightweight there is no waiting for a warm up time like there is with others it starts instantly, the software is very easy to install, it comes with a USB cable electric wire and CDsoftware, after you install the software you will also find a lot of information operation etc when you click on the Epson icon, you can also print information like I did to use as aguide in my case this is my first scanner so I'm a new at ityou can scan documents photos and other things upload them into your computer save them in PDF file windows media and J peg etc, plus you can send them by E mail I haven't mastered allthe functions of it yet when I do I'll add more info to this review, the color image clarity and quality of the uploads prints pictures and copies is amazing beautiful and look exactlylike the originals this scanner has far surpassed all my expectations, it is amazingly fast runs quiet and does not heat up I say this because a friend of mine years ago had one not thisbrand and always complained how hot it got, I highly reccomend this scanner, I hope this helps people sorry I didn't have more info to give you The Epson scanner works beautifully! The V30 is an excellent scanner. This scanner by Epson scored maximum points on both fronts. Perhaps a heavier-duty scanner may be required for some business or office use, but, for personal use, I find this product more than meets my needs. Maybe that's why I'm so impressed with how much scanner you get with an Epson V30, without spending a lot of money.If you're investing a lot of time in scanning photographs, or otherwise need good quality scans, a scanner is not the place to cut corners. My scanner use is basic. This scanner is working great for me.It's a snap to install. That is assuming you put the scanner so it opens at the front.The software is not as good as what I'm used to with my HP scanner. But it works.This is a basic scanner that's suitable for home use or home office use and even a small office. Depending on how long the scanner lasts and how carefree it is, I'd say this is a great buy.Recommended.-- Susanna K. Hutcheson

- with a scanner that has the bells and whistles for those who want to do more.I used the scanner to scan photos and documents (as a jpeg and also as a PDF).

Very easy.ArcSoft MediaImpression came with the Epson scanner.

I like how you can have the scanner do it all, or when you're ready, have the ability to tweak it yourself.
