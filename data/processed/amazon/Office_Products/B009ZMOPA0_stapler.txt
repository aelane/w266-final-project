Who knew a stapler could be pretty. Well, it's a basic stapler. This is just an average stapler in pretty wrapping. As for this stapler, it is performing well and is a real beauty to view! Nothing worse than a wimpy stapler. The stapler does not include staples, so you will need to provide standard staples for it. The stapler is attractive, though the blue in the lower level is not as visible as it appears in the photo. If you see a good, old stapler at a yard sale, grab it. That said, this stapler works fine, even if not quite as solid and smooth as the older models. The stapler does have rubber feet and it is attractively styled (for a stapler) and looks nice. A stapler is a pretty simple design and this one isn't too different from your average office stapler. Stylish, high-quality stapler with a bit of flash. This is a surprisingly good stapler, considering the lightweight looks. The stapler is good looking, nice and heavy, drives staples through "anything", and is built like a tank - so much so, I've used the back end of the stapler as a hammer on several occasions. Yes, its stupid, but I love my stapler. The stapler feels very good in the palm of my hand, doesn't pinch my hand anywhere, and the staple action is easy and doesn't require weightlifter strength or for the stapler to be on a desktop to use. This is a very sleek and stylish looking stapler from Swingline. This stapler looks great next to my Mac and weighty on my desk. This is a medium-duty stapler suitable for office, home, or school use. The stapler weighs 11.5 oz and is 6.5&#8221; long by 1.25&#8221; wide by 2&#8221; high. I'd like to use this stapler for hanging posters on bulletin boards, but it seems it was designed specifically not to do that since it cannot be used flat against a wall. This is a clean looking chrome stapler. But nonetheless a good stapler. This stapler is--well--a stapler so it does its job well and good. This stapler doesn't have any of the latest leverage advantages or loading methods, but it works fine, and it looks great. Sturdy, easy to use stapler that doesn't jam. And being a pro Swingline stapler it works just as expected, and stapling 20 sheets of standard copy paper is not a problem.My only caution on this particular stapler is that the chrome is a real fingerprint magnet, and if you want it to keep that pristine chrome look you'll be having to clean it quite often (or wash those filthy hands before you use it)! If you are tired of just a normal stapler, you will enjoy this "fashion" one. Most of the stapler continues to be metal so it is very durable.Other than the nicer appearance, the stapler works well almost every time. What the stapler doesn&#8217;t do is open up 180 degrees to lay flat against a surface, so it would not be a good choice for crafting or projects.For basic use, this stapler is a good value. This stapler handles all are everyday needs.And this modern style allows the stapler to sit out of the way,on either end, taking up only 1" X 2" desktop.This chrome fashion stapler has durable construction, and is easy to press.It doesn't come with any staples. The stapler feels solid in my hand. So far no problems.The stapler staples 20 pages without undue effort. The stapler opens to a 90 degree angle. He's able to stable one-handed which is convenient if you don't want to leave the stapler sitting on the desk. You receive the stapler. This stapler is definitely a step up from the previous utilitarian black item I was using.3. It is clear that the stapler is built for standard home and office applications where light stapling is required. The stapler works easily and well. This stapler is beautiful as well as functional. This is a very nice looking stapler. When I was teaching, I would do this with my stapler to put things on the bulletin board. With this stapler, it only opened a bit more than 90 degrees, so it wouldn't be possible to use it to staple things on a bulletin board. This stapler has clean, elegant lines and I love the clear blue of the base. This stapler is the most beautiful office supply - or should I say desk accessory? This is a well designed, attractive looking stapler that's perfect for home or office use. Pretty stapler, works  well as a stapler and holds an entire sleeve of staples plus it's kind of pretty. I've had an old Swingline stapler (circa 1970s) for years. Apart from working well, there is little one can say about a stapler. Can a stapler ever really make a fashion statement?This one has very nice, sleek, silver lines, but being the kind of person I am, I thought I would kick that up a notch. This stapler is plastic inside but mostly metal outside. This stapler opens easily to put the staples into it and snaps shut with almost no effort. The stapler also opens up to fit the papers.
