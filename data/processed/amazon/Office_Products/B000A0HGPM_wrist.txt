This is the first wrist pad that my wrist has actually felt good while set upon it. I broke my dominant wrist a few months ago and still have quite a bit of discomfort in it. Because I was given this through Amazon Vine and did not have to pay for it, I will toss the wrist pad, and the little feet for lift and just use the mouse pad. My wrist did not bother me as much as it used to. I always use gel wrist pads attached to my mouse pads, and this one is a little better than the rest. The adjustable wrist pad is really nice, and I don't know why someone didn't think of it sooner. The included wrist rest is also nicely designed; it's comfortable but firm, and it helps your hand make those tiny manipulations without undue fatigue. YWMV (your wrist may vary), of course.Overall, this mouse pad is a labor-saving choice, especially for graphics users. The gel wrist rest is not as soft as I anticipated and maybe that is better for ergonomics, I'm not sure. Anyway it's quite comfortable, more comfortable than resting my wrist on the desk - a very bad habit. I used to have a gel wrist pad mouse that this one replaced. The wrist rest attaches with Command Tape and there is a little play/movement the way it attaches. The wrist rest gets warm, which is a bit irritating, but I just put a washcloth over it. The wrist rest really supports my hand better and I can tell a difference.Pros:Quality materialsEasy to cleanStays put (mostly)Just right sizeCons:None so far after a month of use The wrist pad is a bit firm for my tastes, and I don't use it very much (I never attached it to the mouse pad so I can remove it whenever I want). The gel wrist pad is removeable, which makes it easier to pack.Overall, it's a good product that is worth the additional cost where a rigid surface is needed. The wrist rest is a soft but firm, gel-like material that is attached to the mouse pad with provided double-sided tape. The wrist rest is comfortable, but it is much like other mouse pads with a wrist rest that I've used in the past. The gel wrist pad is extremely comfortable and I like the rubber strips on the bottom that keep the pad from moving around when in use.

The wrist rest is just a little too wide at the center for my preference, but then that'  just me.

It allows the wrist to get the support it needs and is makes a very comfortable computer session.

The wrist rest pad is very large and very hard, and I found it uncomfortable.
