However, this red shoe tape dispenser elicits fond childhood memories.Only Scotch would have dreamed of manufacturing such a unique, attractive tape dispenser. Not only is this red shoe cute and fashionable with its wedge heel, but it is a great conversational piece.I have two ordinary, traditional tape dispensers - one for each of my offices at home and at work. The red shoe tape dispenser is great for women, like my coworker, who collect everything dealing with shoes such as shoe-based lamps, shoe earrings, shoe figurines, etc. I am an avid shoe collector, this tape dispenser is great. It looks cheap...and honestly (I know this sounds odd) -- it doesn't even look all that obviously like a shoe at first glance! Then it might actually look like a shoe in person! This shoe has a metal blade that cuts tape off cleanly, although maybe we just got lucky and got a sharp one. The red shoe is quite adorable, but the light weight of this all plastic affair betrays its usability, which needlessly requires two hands.

The shoe obsessed recipient of this gift from me got it, as will any shoe lover in your life.

The shoe is very cute and attracts interest and comments.

The shoe is fashionable and cute, but is too light weight to stand alone while using the tape.
