The unit comes with 10 pouches, but I've become a laminating fool, plus I wanted to try different sizes.The self adjusting is wonderful. The unit is pretty heavy, a little heavier than other laminators I have used, but the cool touch body probably adds some mass, but it is not too heavy where you cannot easy carry it.This laminator can handle up to 10-mil so it will be probably the only one you need (for most uses). Cheaper unit's I've owned also seemed to consistently produce a warped end. It's heavy!If that is what you are looking for, this unit will quickly and quietly seal large paper stock, For most users, this unit is overkill. This unit supplanted an older lower end version in our office and it is a big hit. This unit has earned a home. But this Jupiter 2 unit handled doing about 35 prints in just over 30 minutes. The unit would not even try to heat those particular pouches and just passed them through.

This is a pricey unit but you are getting what you pay for.

This unit is solidly constructed and does not get hot to the touch (on the outside of the unit) like my 3m does.If laminating is something that you are going to be doing frequently and you need a machine that is going to hold up to your workload ... consider this one.

This is an expensive unit.
