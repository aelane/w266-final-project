This works well for a label or almost anything else and I love that it is fully adhesive on the back so now there is no curling.My only suggestion is a sharper cutting edge, but that's it. I was able to use this a a removable/temporary label on packing cartons as well as break off one inch pieces to use as page marking tabs in my books. The label aspect is where the real gold is. This means, you are no longer stuck with sticking a label on plastic because that is the only thing that the label will come off of. I wrote a little label and stuck it on a wooden dresser. I can not be bothered to go out & buy a label machine.I do not find I would use it enough to justify spending the money on one. When you're done, the label is easy to remove.The bright green paper stands out so these labels get noticed. If you don't have a label maker this is a cheap way to label stuff. If you want to see the label from far away, I suggest a medium size black marker. It's exactly what it sounds like, a sticky label on a rolling dispenser. Although the label got wet and I could slide it around, it stayed put.

Do you need a small label or a long label?

I use it mostly as a label and have found that it sticks securely to just about anything I place it on, even those items the manufacturer says it may not work on, and comes off cleanly and with little effort.

I recently got tired of buying the expensive label tape for my p-touch, but I still need to label things - this is the perfect solution!
