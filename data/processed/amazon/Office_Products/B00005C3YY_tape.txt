Same Scotch tape I used as a little kid for various school projects and assignments. This has been my favorite tape for years...which is why we probably call &#34;tape&#34;, &#34;scotch tape&#34;!It simply is better then the others in my opinion. This tape comes in handy when Christmas Day is only a few weeks away. It is not difficult to remove the tape from the dispenser, so it is easy to use. The tape is not one-hundred percent see through, since the matte finish makes it looks glossy. Magic tape is virtually invisible when applied. It's Scotch tape... and just what you expect from Scotch tape. What can I say - it's Scotch tape! I bought this tape because there's a upcomingbirthday for friend's daughter. Much too thin and not long lasting either.if your going to make tape thin then atleast make it long enough to last.Not the case here, it ran out too fast.buy something that has more length to it.but sense i do like scotch i give them a 4. Gee, I guess I've been using this tape for around 50 years.
