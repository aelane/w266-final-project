The blade locks down for safety, and there is a handle for ease of carrying.I am satisfied with this. I prefer this blade in that it gets the edge so crisp and clean, however, I prefer the other trimmer with the track because I can easily view the exact line to be cut. Its blade is nice and sharp, and the motion of the handle is very smooth. The blade locks down so that with the handle, I have been able to take it with me and have in my classroom to use on the spot. The blade is nice and sharp, and cuts well as long as you don't overload it. It is so light to carry, and easy to use.The blade is perfect to give an accurate, sharp and safe cut. The blade feels pretty sharp and cuts well. The blade clicks into place for secure storage and a built in handle makes it convenient to carry. I'd wanted a blade cutter at home but didn't want to spend $100 or more to get it! The blade works great with typical Fiskars quality. I liked that the blade was very sharp and I was able to get clean cuts with near perfect edges. As for how well the blade will stay sharp and cut well--only time will tell. The blade does have a "safety lock" feature. You basically pull the blade out about 1/2 inch away from the deck to lower it below a plastic protrusion and then you move the blade back next to the deck. Not that it won't work to lock the blade in place--it does.
