It virtually disappears once you put it on wrapping paper. I am more into wrapping with wrapping patterned paper than the expensive option of gift bags. So I tend to be very picky when it comes to my paper and tape. The wrapping paper no longer shows the tape as easily and it just looks more "professionally" wrapped. While it might not actually disappear on the paper, I doubt many people pay much attention to the tape when they're busy tearing open gifts. It completely dissapears into the paper and makes your gifts look flawless. It sticks wrapping paper well, essentially disappearing into the paper once stuck. On white paper, the Magic Tape is consistently less conspicuous than the GiftWrap tape. It also looks better on red paper, bright or dark prints, and probably -though I didn't try it- on bright blue paper such as one might like for Hanukkah. However, it will definitely show up if you're using foil paper or any other paper that's shiny. It's virtually invisible on wrapping paper and holds everything in place. It blends in pretty well with the wrapping paper, but isn't as transparent as others I have used. I used wrapping paper that has a black background with regular scotch tape. Its holds wrapping paper in place extremely well. If you gently apply it to paper or giftwrap, it will have a slightly-opaque appearance. It sticks to the wrapping paper nicely and it's super easy to get off the roll.
