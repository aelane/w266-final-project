This is a great binder for two reasons:1) the sturdy, one-touch ring that doesn't break easily from being opened and closed or from having a ton of papers in the binder2) the no-toner transfer plastic view. This is a big binder and is the thickest one I've ever seen. Well made, durable binder. This binder can hold up to 550 sheets of paper which is an enormous amount of paper. This binder only has two inside pockets with one on each inside cover and they are strong. This is indeed a sturdily built binder and would be excellent for uses where it will be used a lot but not need to be opened and closed often. I need a big binder! Great binder. It's a well-made binder staying far away from flimsy quality and holds up well on a shelf due to a sturdy, thicker board beneath all the plastic covers. Also, this binder has the front and back cover outside pockets so you can label them with a slip of paper, which is nice.This particular binder doesn't seem quite as nice as some other Wilson Jones binders I have (with it missing the double pockets and being really hard to get the rings open), but it still seems like a perfectly serviceable binder. This solid, yet not too bulky or heavy binder is perfect for office or home. I have always found that once a binder of this size is filled, the rings become loose and ineffective. A solid binder, well worth the price. This is a very nice basic binder. I use this binder in my career as a teacher, so its gets almost daily use. If your looking for a good solid 2&#34; binder I don't think you will be disappointed. I'm also finding that the binder rings are very difficult to get open. So, despite having these really cool, slanted D-rings, the binder is a chore to use. The binder is plain white with clear pockets so you can dress it up however you see fit. Overall, It's a nice binder but I don't really feel that it's any better than the heavy duty binders from Avery. I am using this binder for homeschooling to keep track of my kids' records. inside the binder makes it less bendy than cheaper binders, but for 5 times the price.The description of this binder says it's "Backed by a 1-year Guarantee" and later in the description it says "and the 5 year satisfaction guarantee". A typical binder of this size is usually quite a bit cheaper so I was interested in knowing if this binder is worth the asking price. I've become quiet organized lately and this binder is one I'm actually using for recipes. This sturdy binder will get heavy use this summer when visitors to my exhibit booth at the Fair thumb through the pages of my exhibit binder. This is a strong binder that can withstand heavy handling at an outdoor exhibit. This is a durable binder that is easy to load and close. This seems like a very durable binder that will hopefully hold up over time. This binder is pretty good, but nowhere near durable or high enough quality to warrant the high price. Wilson Jones Heavy Duty D-Ring View Binder with Extra Durable Hinge is a decent binder. (This 2-inch binder holds 550 sheets.) I believe this binder will last for years.There are pockets on the inside front and back and the outside has a clear cover and spine you can insert cover sheets and labels into to personalize the binder.This binder is a handsome workhorse. I have this binder in the 2" White option. I wouldn't bet on that but this binder does seem to be a bit better quality than many others out there on the market. Time will tell but I'd be surprised if these lasted much longer than any other binder out there. My binder came with a little hole in one of the inner pockets from where one of the rings rubs against it. For them, I have found that a flexible binder in general will make it farther though the school year. This is a solid binder, and HUGE. It is hard to go wrong with a standard binder. This is a nice, sturdy, dependable binder.

I reviewed the Wilson Jones 3-inch binder and the 2-in is MUCH nicer.

This binder is a versatile size.

I'd say the binder is of average sturdiness, nothing remarkable but perfectly adequate.
