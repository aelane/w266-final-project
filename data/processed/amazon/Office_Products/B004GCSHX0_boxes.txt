I'm really pleased with these boxes. The Fellowes Banker boxes are nice and heavy duty. The other boxes that I have are really long and they just get too heavy to move around and handle, probably one reason they fall apart on me.I was very pleased with these. Perfect boxes for the price tag. We have other boxes like these for storage, but these are by far the "favorite". The runners-up being boxes from U-haul, and similar boxes from Staples. These boxes are fully assembled, except for the lids. These are much sturdier than the cheap boxes I've used before, that got totally crushed during moving. While still not as sturdy as heavy-duty moving boxes, these feel like they'll hold up much, much better. These cardboard boxes fit either letter or legal folders perfectly, are stackable and sturdy and the lids have flaps that fold into the carrying holes for easy toting. Banker boxes come and go.

These boxes come assembled, all you have to do is pull apart the corners and push the bottom down- 2 seconds.

These boxes also were a little bit larger, although they were slightly more difficult to put together.

These boxes are awesome.... the only thing keeping me from rating them 5 stars is that they are on the pricey side.
