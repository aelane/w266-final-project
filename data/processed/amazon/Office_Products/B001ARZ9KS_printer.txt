With my Epson C60 (and still working perfectly) I was seeking any printer that does what my Epson C60 does. This printer does exactly that. First I contacted Epson USA and asked if Epson sells any printer that does what my Epson C60 does. Epson USA stated to me that no printer that they have currently does this. No HP printer does this I was told. Anyway I now have a new printer that does exactly what I want. With this HP printer just place the envelope to the right and make sure you have correct side up and it feeds perfectly with paper still in tray.I have read all of these reviews. The printer operates flawlessly. This printer has a small LCD screen that for some may be hard to read. This printer is a small form factor printer and fits exactly on the footprint of my Epson C60. I did not want a huge printer. This is a small printer and exactly what fits my needs. This printer feeds paper from front and printed paper also comes out front. This printer is for personal use. For me this printer is an excellent choice for what I do.I would have preferred an Epson as I have had 8 years with the C60 with no issues.
