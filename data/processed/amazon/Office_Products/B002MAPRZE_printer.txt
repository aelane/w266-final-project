I was excited to try out this printer. This printer has some great points, and then some not so great points:The Good- Wifi works well so far- Ink is cheap compared to HP ink- Built in card reader- CheapThe Bad- Poorly designed paper tray, in fact one of the worst I've seen- Color quality on photographs is not as good as on my HPAlthough this printer has all of those good things going for it, in the end I just didn't care for the color quality in photographs. If that is important to you, I would recommend this printer. Edited:This printer forces you to buy a new color cartridge every 7 to 12 months even if you don't print a single color document - in fact, it runs out faster than the black cartridge I use all the time. Also the printer is very quiet during operation. Many printer / scanners can also double as a fax, so I'm not sure why Kodak eliminated this feature. I do also have a Kodak EasyShare printer for my camera and it uses a thermal printing process. If not for that, I could've finally thrown that crappy HP printer in the trash. The Kodak ESP 5250 is just an OK printer. I'd say it's an OK printer if you can get it at a lower than retail price but there are plenty of printers out there so do your researchThis is a very light-weight printer. It came out of the printer with smeared and an excessive amount of black ink completely down the entire left edge of the page. I'm very pleased with this printer and since it is wireless, I can now easily print from any computer in the house. This printer is amazing (and no, I don't usually get excited about printers). My previous printer was also connected to my home wireless network but I had to physically connect my laptop to the printer via USB to scan. I have used the Windows Live Photo Gallery from Vista and other printer's, scanner's or camera's software and it has always been a struggle to print a dang picture. I can put the printer anywhere in the house, and it works without needing to string USB (or, if you're old school, parallel cables) all over the place. This printer is a really good reason to stop going to the department store to have photos printed out.I like the little status screen on the printer. Instead of selling the printer for dirt-cheap and gouging customers on the ink and paper, Kodak is selling the printer for a reasonable (but higher) price, and then selling us the supplies at a much more sane price point. I like that when you open the printer to change ink, there's a little prop (not unlike what you'd find under a car's hood) that keeps the printer open while you're doing your thing. In the Kodak printer's case, the large blue LED is the WiFi connection indicator, and it sometimes stays on-- glowing quite brightly-- even after you've finished printing. As I keep my printer in my bedroom, it's one more light distracting me at night. It could have been the perfect printer if not for this shortcoming.Bottom line: If you want to print on the Kodak ESP 5250, you NEED both ink cartridges whether or not you're using color. - This is true with any printer that uses cartridges with has multi-color reservoirs.When it comes to scanning and copy please beware that the ESP 5250 is only a 24-bit device with a maximum optical resolution of 1,200 and is painfully slow to scan using the Home Center Software, the scan quality is good but not excellent, if you intend to have this purely for scanning job then you may have to reconsider your decision in buying this AIO device as the scanner is meant only for convenience rather than a good feature. After using this printer for a bit I came out of it feeling really middle of the road.It has wireless connectivity that I used and setup using WPA2 with no problems. I've tried my best to revive this printer from the dead. Overall, this is a very good printer, especially for those who does printing both in color and black and white (and also when printing color, most of the time it is multiple color, and not just one or two color - to optimize the ink usage).Pros:1.

From unpacking the printer to actually printing took approximately fifteen minutes.

After plugging the printer into the wall, the LCD screen lit up and I selected "Network Settings" then "Wireless Setup Wizard" on the printer menu.

Included with the printer is a sample pack of photo paper.
