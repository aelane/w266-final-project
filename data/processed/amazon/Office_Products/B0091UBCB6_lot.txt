It offers a lot of bells and whistles. They cost more, but also last a lot longer. There is a lot to like about Epson's Workforce 3520. We don't do a whole lot of faxing, but I greatly appreciate that I can with this machine. This saves a lot of time!3. I print a lot for homeschool purposes and love that this will scan easily and print 2 sided copies. We sold a lot of Epson printers back in the day because they were priced aggressively. We also got a lot of defective/returns of Epson printers because they just didn't hold up - no one liked them. I've printed a lot and still haven't used up the sample cartridges yet. I've had a lot of trouble getting faxes to work with our cable phoneline in the past, but this worked great on first try. I print a lot of greeting cards and some colors run out sooner than others.
