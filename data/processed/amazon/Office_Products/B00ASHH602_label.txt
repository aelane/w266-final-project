This label maker will help me keep clothes straight, particularly coats and mittens and hats in the winter. The label immediately melted leaving blobs on the cloth and crud on the iron. This little label maker works great for making name tag labels in the field. I like to make a personalized label with the name of the giftee, the date, and the care instructions every time I make something to give away. This label works tool is my favorite at the moment. I put a label on a backpack and matching labels on binders. I am going a little label happy.Maybe I will put labels on the kids so I can remember their names... The Epson label maker is perfect for those implementing the Getting Things Done program by David Allen. This Epson label maker is pretty simple to use. Applying the label on the fabric is fun part, I think. I've only had one label fall off on a type of vinyl jacket that was an unusual material (a ski jacket). I had been using aCasio KL-780 EZ Label Printerand I had to go over each label with tape in order to get them to stick and stay. I did a nice label for school with a border and stuck it on his cup, and it hasn't come off, not even when I washed it (by hand, not sure how it would hold up in the dishwasher, but it feels like it would still stay attached). The Epson LabelWorks Iron On Kit includes a label printer, a white ribbon cartridge, a blue ribbon cartridge, a case, and a user's guide. Epson L300 label maker is easy and fun to use. I've used label makers before, but I love how far they have come along with Epson's Labelworks printer. I haven't had a label maker since the 70s. You can buy the label printer and the cartridges separately. We tried some basic Epson label cartridges from our local office supply store. You can save up to 30 label layouts, print multiple copies of a label, create sequentially numbered labels and create extra long or extra short labels. If you doubt this, just pull out a label maker next time the kids are around. However, if you're prepared for this, I think you will be very pleased with this particular label printer. The label was easy to make and print and cut off with no problem.
