Perfect time for letting go. Cool down time is up to 30 minutes. It came at the right time, just when I was clearing out years worth of financial statements and other similar confidential paper. However, the time spent unjamming the darned things made tearing important papers into small pieces more appealing. If I have time in the near future, I may replace this review with a video version to demonstrate this product along with my duct tape cardboard ramp. It sucks in about 4 at a time and chomps them up. Unfortunately, just about every time it got near the bottom of the pile it somehow folded the last set it was drawing it in, meaning it was now trying to shred a double-fold of 8 sheets - and it jammed. Designed to save you time, I've found it takes MORE Of my time to use this shredder than a standard design. This time, it got through nearly all the sheets, but jammed near the end. That said, it does work some of the time, and the pull-out tray makes it easier to empty, so it's my shredder of choice at the moment. Most of the time I have a couple of individual sheets, old bills, receipts, or unopened junk mail that I want to get rid of. It requires continuous monitoring all the time. Most of the time, it was because the bin was full so the shredding blades needed to be cleared out.
