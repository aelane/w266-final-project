We boxed up the scanner and sent it to a repair shop. As far as I can tell this is the same scanner as the Epson Perfection V500, which is marketed as a photo scanner, but with the addition of an automatic document feeder. You can use the scanner with other software if you prefer. The scanner also came with Adobe Photoshop Elements 6.This scanner would be great for light office work, it saves a ton of time from lifting up the lid, placing the document on the scanner, scanning....etc. Since then I have used my Canonscan mainly as a flatbed scanner, although occasionally I need to convert a few negatives, for other people or when we use a disposable camera. You do not have to wait for the scanner to warm up, great for a quicker scanning of a couple documents. He told me that I needed to take the scanner to an authorized service depot for repair. I could understand that if the scanner was a year old or otherwise out of warranty, but for something that's only two weeks old???

That's the V500 Office scanner.

It's strictly a single sided scanner.

The scanner driver has three levels of complexity - Home, Office, and Professional.
