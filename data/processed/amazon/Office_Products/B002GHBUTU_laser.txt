The laser is green which is pretty awesome, it's alarmingly clear from quite a distance. Got this laser pointer/presenter from Amazon.com's vine program, like always, delivery was amazingly fast.The thing that struck me most when I took it out from the box was its size, it's really small, about the same size as if you put two Pilot ball pens side by side. Logitech Presenter R800The green laser is very impressive. Compared to my Targus's red laser, the green laser is much more visible on almost all surfaces. The green laser is VERY bright even in a room with all of the overhead lights on! There's a laser pointer. What's more, a green laser. The laser pointer on it is also very bright and goes a long distance. The green laser is bright. The green laser is very bright & strong. The green laser is much brighter than the red, and is much easier to see by the audience when pointing to bright screens and slides. The R400 also has a red laser instead of a green one.This unit is still recommended, particularly if the timer function and green laser are important to you.Enjoy. The laser pointer is very nice--in a fully lit room, the green laser is extremely bright, whereas my older pointer (a red laser) is dull and hard to see. If you use a laser pointer a lot, this is a great unit for that alone.The receiver is smaller than the old unit. The laser on this R800 is much brighter, and works well even in large rooms. The laser is bright and easy to trigger.My one complaint is the timer. As far as the laser pointer goes, it looks like a white light shining through a green crystal. I know that the laser will project at least 60 feet. The green laser dot is very much visible and bright. The green laser is much clearer and easier on the eyes than a red laser. The green laser is sharp and usually draws a comment or two because people are accustomed to seeing red lasers. The laser is sharp and I am still on the original batteries.

The green laser's projection was bright and visible from all points.

The laser pointer button, also indented, is located above the slide controls, and the transition from slide control to pointer requires virtually no effort.

I really like the green laser rather than the more traditional red - somehow it is less jarring.The timer feature is especially welcome for lectures or talks that must end at a specific time.
