Smooth flowing ink, easy to handle, good grip. I love gel ink pens, but they do tend to smear. It doesn't skip or make gummy ink spots. How often do pen write with red ink? I wish the ink was a little less bold but otherwise perfect. The ink cartridges rival rollerballs for smooth writing. They haven't blobbed ink and the ink seems to dry quickly, so no smearing of the ink. I'm left handed, and there are no ink smears on my hand from normal writing.Perhaps the biggest advantage of this over a gel pen like a G2 is that it dries quickly and doesn't run if the paper happens to get wet. Gel ink takes a few hour to dry fully, after which it will not smudge when wet. The ink flows smoothly without skips and halts.It has a plastic body with a steel clip. The ink flows easily and neatly; the pen is light and has a good grip.

Then I realized I was getting ink on my hands and my clothes whenever I used one for long.

They write bright and smooth like gel ink pens, but they dry instantly like regular pens.

The ink glides with the gel ink.
