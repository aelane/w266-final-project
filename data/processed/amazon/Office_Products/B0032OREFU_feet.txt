If you put your feet off to the side it tips over. Unless you keep your feet together, which most folks don't, you can only heat/cool one foot at a time, which is pretty annoying.The power cord is also pretty short. Until I got this footrest, I was resting my feet on a subwoofer under my desk, hardly the best option, although I cannot honestly say that this is better, just different.The unit has a hard, knobby, plastic surface to massage your feet and vents through which a fan directs airflow. You'll end up cramming your feet up in the top center of the unit or in the case of the high heat setting on the edge to avoid the blistering heat.Given that this is summer time the cooling fan was more appropriate but it really doesn't cool it just blows and as I said it's not at all evenly distributed. The feet warm quickly at the two heat levels. We're sorry about that, and so are my feet." I suppose if you rub your feet on it you can keep your circulation going with the little massage-type knobs on it, if circulation problems are an issue for you. I can imagine it would be nice to rest your feet on a toasty warm footrest when it's cold, but right now I can't even grasp the concept of being cold. I did tend to kick it around with my feet and this might have squished the cord. It gets warm enough to warm your feet up without making them too hot. If I sit with my feet separated and on the outsides then I may as well not have the climate control turned on. It'll cool your feet down, it'll warm them back up, and if you rub your feet around on it it'll give you a light foot massage too. It is great, because when my feet are warm, my whole body feels warm. Little knobs give your feet some grip. This might keep your feet cooler in the summer.The real joy will come in the cold winter, when at your work office or home office, you will delight in soothing warmth coming from the device. After all, what can be more annoying and distracting than cold feet while trying to work on a project? I usually prop my feet up on the bar across the back of my desk or some packages of shipping materials. My feet are usually hot, so I have not used the 125 watts Low or the Hi 250 watts heat settings, but I am sure that those seeking toasty toes will enjoy this product.Both the front legs and the back legs adjust to angle the product to a comfortable level.This is a useful and inexpensive product that may help those of us with hot or cold feet.
