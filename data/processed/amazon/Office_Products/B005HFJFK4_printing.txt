Duplex printing works.There are very few negatives but the glossy surfaces of the printer do attract fingerprints. I haven't tried printing pictures on photo paper yet, but everything else I had done and the color is absolutely wonderful. It worked great and automatically (no more trying to manually do two sided printing). But for general printing and even CD-ROM printing can't think of a better printer small home office.Thank you very much for reading my review. Also wireless printing from a smartphone or tablet a feature I haven't used or tried is added on this model. I've tried printing photos on the few pieces of photo paper they provided and it looks unbelievably good. Fast printing of black and white too.The setup instructions were incredibly clear, and I got it on my network and running incredibly quickly. (I gave up local printing of photo images a long time ago, after I discovered that it's usually a lot cheaper to use a commercial on-line printing service. The duplex printing was awesome (it's truly an added bonus!) I honestly have yet to come across a bad printing product made by epson. We are very happy with the Epson Artisan 837's printing quality when it comes to photographs. It also offers duplex printing (both sides of paper) which is the feature I was really interested in. Photo printing quality is exceptional. The printing process using my 4 or 5 year old Dell computer takes a LONG time...definitely more than 3 minutes to "send" a print job from this computer, so that is annoying.It was much more difficult to set up this printer on our wireless network than it was to set up our previous Dell printer. The printing clarity and color is great. We have an Epson 840 WorkForce here which we do our two-sided printing on and if the 837 works anything like that then it's a dream to use.The 837 printer came with the individual ink carts needed as well as a high capacity black which was nice.Printing speed on DVDs is super fast but obviously the speed depends on the complexity of the graphic you're sending to the disc. Whether I was copying or printing I had no problem doing what I wanted to do.The quality of the prints were very good. Normal single-sided printing is very fast. Two-sided printing is considerably slower, as the printer waits for the ink to dry before printing the second side.Photo Printing - The Artisan 837 adds two more color cartridges to the standard cyan, magenta, yellow and black mix. Along with two-sided printing, you can also automatically copy both sides of a paper. With CD printing as one of the features, the Artisan also incorporated a CD/DVD copy mode.
