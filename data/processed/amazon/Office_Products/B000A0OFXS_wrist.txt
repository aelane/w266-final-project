I do think this wrist rest helps. That I can't attest to, but I do know that this wrist rest will be quite easy to keep clean. The 3M Tilt-Adjustable Gel Wrist Rest Platform claims that it encourages a comfortable, neutral wrist position. The wrist rest is wrapped in a soft, leather-like material and is by far, the most comfortable and durable I've ever used. If not for the wonderful wrist rest that was included, I would have rated it even less. Since the wrist rest comes off easily, I took it in my computer bag yesterday (without the tray) and used it to tilt/prop up/vent the laptop while working at a coffee house.Because the wrist rest is so long (about 18") and wide (about 2") it was pretty stable and vented pretty well. The gel wrist pad is also firmer than what I really like, there is some cushion to it but not much.The cost-to-benefit ratio of this platform is poor in my opinion. The wrist pad is about only an inch or two wider than my thin HP wireless keyboard. I should mention that the wrist pad is thinner than most pads. I like the wrist rest platform, it works well for me. The wrist rest is very firm, it doesn't really give at all. It may not work for those who would like or need a soft wrist rest. Unless it's dropped to around $25, I'd recommend shopping around for a different wrist rest platform. Thankfully this wrist rest kit seems to have finally solved that problem since I can now raise my keyboard higher than the limits of just the keyboard feet. The wrist pad is comfortable, but raises my hands higher over the low keyboard than I would like. The wrist pad is thick and comfortable--the gel isn't too giving nor too stiff. If you suffer from severe wrist pain, I would suggest you also look into Dragon Naturally Speaking.~ Lee Mellott This gel wrist pad was a life saver for me. While the leatherette wrist rest is extremely nice it still seemed a bit overpriced for the rest of what you receive. The wrist pad is firm (I like that) and it looks good on my desk.I deducted one star from an otherwise 5-star review because this is only minimally adjustable and those adjustment choices may not suit everyone. I was having extreme wrist and elbow pain, largely due to the way I sit at my computer. My wrist was sitting on a ledge of the desk lip that holds the keyboard. The gel-like wrist guard is nothing short of a blessing, and I love the tilt of the board. I have a gel wrist wrest that I much prefer, but what I do absolutely love about this keyboard surface, is that even though it is a bit heavy to carry around, it's the perfect hard surface to use on the coach with a keyboard if you are typing a lot! Previously I owned just the wrist rest separately, and have really enjoyed using it.Product is sturdy, you get less wiggling when typing on it rather than when you have the little feet extended on your keyboard.Wrist rest is removable for cleaning under the crevices.It does keep your keyboard from sliding around on the desk.Bad:It is not really adjustable.
