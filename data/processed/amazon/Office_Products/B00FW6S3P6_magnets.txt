It also comes with two magnets that I don't use - but you could hold a paper note to the board with the magnet if you roll that way. It erases nicely and the magnets are sturdy firm.I have not tried to hang it on the wall, but the hanger doesn't appear to be very sturdy. Handy.The clear magnets are great for attaching appointment cards or grocery lists, etc.I don't care for the provided means of securing it to a wall or refrigerator because for me it will not stick well enough.I'll get a mount at the hardware shop so I can fasten it to a wall with a better, firmer grip. The 2 included magnets are handy too. The four magnets on the back that hold it to the fridge seem to be weak. It comes with 2 magnets as well as the marker with eraser on top. Some of these Quartet magnets come with magnets that have a striped design. Unfortunately, the magnets weren't strong enough to hold the weight of the board, which slowly slid down the refrigerator door. It is easy to put together and the magnets are a great addition for sticking paper notes to the board (especially if you don't have it on a magnetic fridge). To be fair, I had the two included front magnets on the board, the marker attached by clip and A SINGLE 4x6&#34; PHOTO under one of the magnets. It's nice that it comes with 2 magnets and a dry erase marker included. The magnets are nice, and very handy, and it came with a marker, too. The magnets adhere with 3M adhesive, so I have no worries about the board ever falling. I love the magnets that came with it. I highly doubt the magnets included would hold that one either, but I attached it to a door so I was unable to test it. There are two little magnets that come with it, in case you feel the need to attach something to the board. It works well, but the magnets did not hold it well on our refrigerator, it would seem to be okay and then start to slide downward a couple of minutes later. I'm not sure if that was due to the magnets included or maybe the metal composition of the refrigerator?? It comes with some magnets and a marker. The front magnets are reasonably strong. It comes with four sturdy magnets to adhere to the back of the board, and it holds up well. The magnets that it comes with are super-strong. The included magnets are helpful. We used other magnets to &#34;prop&#34; it in position, but after a few slides and falls, we ended up having to get rid of it.This new Quartet Magnetic Dry erase board has all of the same issues. Removing the magnets does no damage to the dry-erase board, affixed the adhesive pads, stuck it on my door and proceeded to write on it in about 15 minutes.One handy feature that is not listed is that on the tip of the dry-erase marker provided with the product is a handy eraser, which obviates the need of using a paper towel (though that will certainly work too).All in all, a great product for the cost. * The magnets it comes with are stuck to the board with a blob of sticky goo, which refused to wipe off once I removed the magnets. The magnets work about as good as most of the other boards in this price range. I did not use the magnets or the stickies. The magnets seem pretty strong, so I could put little notes up too. I applied the four magnets to the double side foam spacers (which have tape on one side to secure to back of dry erase board) and put one magnet on each of the four sides of the board. The four magnets supplied, are not strong enough to secure the board to the refrigerator. It comes with 2 magnets (other magnets also work). So, I decided to use the magnets to hold it to my metal door. I stuck the magnets on the sticky pads. Which means I had magnets on foam coming out from the back of the framed whiteboard.
