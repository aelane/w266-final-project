Anywhere else, though, this memo and paper clip holder would look right at home.I recommend not only this item, but the whole collection. This is a nice little memo and paper clip holder and even comes with paper and paper clips. This is a really nice memo and paper clip holder. It's an in between the regular memo pad and the big one. The included memo pad and paper clips aren't the greatest quality, but can be easily replaced with a wide variety of brands, including post its. The Swingline acrylic memo and paper clip holder is made of durable, heavy-weight acrylic and adds a stunning look to my desk. When the memo paper it came with runs out, I plan to cut some more out of scratch paper the exact same size, as a refill. This is elegant and simply well done.I do wish the memo pad size was matched to a post it.

This acrylic memo and paper clip holder fits quite well on my desk.

Next, the memo pad is plain paper of an odd size when everyone uses post-it notes.

It comes with a memo pad and some multi-colored paper clips.
