Other than that a very useful product. I have been longing for this product for a long time. Other than that, I love the product! I think this product is a great idea. This is definitely a product I will buy. I received this product from Amazon Vine.I love Post-It products. This product is exactly what I need and I have already used it to label numerous things with no extra trimming or effort. Where has this product been all my writing life?I keep a little cosmetic case with essentials (or what might become essentials) to carry with me to my book signings. This product is OK, I guess, but it is kind of gimicky. I mean Post It Notes is a great product, so now it looks like the manufacturer is trying every possible variation on this basic product - I've seen and reviewed other variations. Simple product. I think this product is ingenious in its simplicity. This is a very handy product that includes quite a bit of tape as well, which makes it a sound value. This product works like the description states. Great product, and in versatile widths. This product allows you to tear off just the right amount of the tape, label or write your note and stick where needed. This is a great product to quickly label containers, food products, bins, etc. This is a fun product for everyday use. This nifty new product is half Post-it, half masking tape. I recently used this product at a one day event, labeling things so people I didn't work with normally knew where everything was. (And, no, I don't work for them, I just love it when a product works as advertised and does something you'd been wanted a product to do for a long time!) I plan to always have this product handy. And this is another product that I easily find uses for. This product works for such an application only if I pull off an extra amount to fold over itself, negating any savings in material this format might provide.As many other reviewers have also mentioned, the cutter is also curiously dull, resulting in tears rather than cuts, both a visual and handling annoyance. Sometimes, you don't know that you need a product until it's in your hands - and such is the case with this Post-it "tape." This is a fun product. Great product. I know this product states that it can be used as a normal post-it or a label, but I honestly don't know why you would want to use this as a post-it. Great product! I think this product has great potential. I find this product incredibly useful. I love this new product from Post-it. Otherwise, this product makes labeling things quick and easy. I wasn't all that excited about reviewing this product. When I first found out about this product, I was excited--I use sticky notes ALL the time with work and school, to mark pages and places to sign, etc.This Post-It Full Adhesive Roll is good for ONE thing. I highly recommend this product. It may sound silly, but I really love this product. This product,Post-it Full Adhesive Roll, 1 x 400 Inches, Green, 1-Pack ,2650-G, appears to work as advertised. Where has this product been all my life? I just think this new product is fantabulous. This is an awesome product, and here is why:It replaces at least 3 products for me... Sticky notes, sticky labels for creating tabs or marking pages and labeling labels.I used to carry at least 2 of these with me and now I just carry this little roll.Pros:- Portable- Easily removable (when needed)- Good thickness- Easy to write on ( when rolled out)- Easy to see- You choose the lengthCons:- Dispenser is a little bulky- Hard to write on it before you unroll and stick.I like this product and it replaces several for me and it's convenient. This is a nice, handy little product that does just what it is intended to do. Here's another useful product from 3M - nothing earth shattering but something that is so very useful. This is a really cool product. This product is great for emergency use, such as when I needed to be able to temporarily label items for individual students in my classroom. This product provides an alternative that is removable. I seriously love this product and have used it for everything and almost everywhere. I love this product! I would love to see this product in many different colors. It's hard to say much about this product. It's an okay product. I used this product on a drinking glass with condensation. This Post-It product from 3M is designed for convenience and flexibility.

Another product to consider is the full-adhesive Post-it notes (which are full adhesive and not just a strip at the top), but I found those only really work on flat things.

I would buy this product in the future if there were more options in color and width and a better cutting apparatus on the dispenser, but this product is okay for the most part.

****This product will most likely appeal to fans of Post-It notes--of which I am one!
