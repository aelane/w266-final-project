The Smart Weigh SWS1kg is a small portable scale with a maximum weight of 1000 grams and is readable to 0.1 grams. The scale is powered by two supplied AAA batteries.This is a highly dampened scale; it is not at all sensitive to vibrations or wind currents (disturbances within reason).Out of the box the scale was slightly out of calibration by 0.2 g. It is easy to calibrate the scale with a single point weight of 500 g. After calibration the scale was perfect at 20.0, 50.0 and 500.0 g with ASTM class 2 weights.The scale is easy to use. The SWS-1KG digital scale is not only quite reasonably priced but is quite versatile and has the capacity to measure everything from gold to diamonds with 0.1g accuracy. The scale will weigh up to 1000 grams, 2.20 pounds. The SWS-1KG digital scale is a scale that is a multipurpose one and can be used for anything like weighing food products to jewelry.WHAT&#8217;S IN THE BOX:&#9658;  Digital Touchscreen Scale&#9658;  Cover / Tray&#9658;  Quick Start Guide&#9658;  2 AAA BatteriesFEATURES:&#9788;  Tenth of a gram accuracy (0.01g)&#9788;  1000 gram maximum capacity&#9788;  Flip open protective cover&#9788;  Powered by 2 AAA batteries (included)&#9788;  Auto-off after 60 secondsSPECS:&#9658;  Capacity:  1000g / 35.27 oz / 35.15ozt / 643.0dwt&#9658;  Readability:  0.1g / 0.01oz / 0.01ozt / 0.1dwt&#9658;  Scale Size: 5 x 3 x 0.8&#8221; / 128 x 78 x 20mm&#9658;  Platform Size:  2.5 x 3.0&#8221; / 63.5 x 76mm&#9658;  Power:  2 AAA Batteries (included)&#9658;  Calibration:  500 gramsWARRANTY:&#9788;  Ten year limited.Sample provided for review. If you are looking for an even more accurate scale than this one, then I would recommend checking out the JDS20 jewelry scale from the same manufacturer.This is probably as big of a &#34;pocket&#34; scale as it would be feasible to have. This is a very compact, robust and well made scale. I got this scale as a gift, and to be honest it felt a little oddball and I wasn't sure what to do with it.

This is a very neatly, simply and elegantly designed little scale that is great for measuring small weights in an on-the-go situations.

The scale is overall very well built and is capable of sustaining all sorts of impacts and scratching when completely closed.It can measure weights of up to 1000 g (2.2 lbs) in one tenth (0.1) of a gram increments.

The scale runs on two AAA batteries (included), features a rectangular-sided measuring area which covers about 70% of the scale, and two different function buttons in addition to the on/off button.
