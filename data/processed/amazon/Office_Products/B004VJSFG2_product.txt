Overall, a good, quality product for a reasonable price. You'd think it'd be hard to improve on a classic product like Post-It notes. Not only is it a great , simple product ; but it is made better simply because of this fact This product has a 100% satisfaction guarantee.These are going on my desk! With this product, you get what you pay for....it's a bit cheap. This product is not competitive in price. I believe the competing product also has each individual colored pad shrink wrapped (which is a real pain) - so this was a significant improvement as I'd rather struggle getting off the plastic wrap once as opposed to 5 or 6 times. When I ordered this product, I thought "sticky notes are all the same". I'm very pleased with the product.

This is a very useful and fun-to-use product, so use your imagination!

I find this product to be superior to Post-It and will now be ordering Avery sticky pads.

This is a far superior product.
