Our stapler was always disappearing - we have 2 kids - so seeing this available was a chance to just maybe get our main stapler to stay by the phone where we try to keep it. This stapler fits my needs perfectly. Other than that, it is a stapler that does its work as advertised. This is a very basic stapler that works exactly as expected and should hold up well to normal craft, project, or homework duty.Recommended!CFH Not much to write about a stapler lol, but it works well and hasnt let me down at college. can't expect more or less from a cheap stapler but if u want better go get the high quality ones First it needs to be a stapler that can handle the amount of work that I do daily and weekly. This swingline stapler accomplishes both.I like the fact that it's not easy to jam and that it is suited with the proper footing to stay put and not scuff your desk.A stapler is an important asset to your life in the office, and this one definitely takes care of the job well. I have another light-duty stapler, but this one is more user-friendly. The stapler works as expected, but didn't come with any staples unfortunately. The Swingline Standard Stapler, "Eco Version" is as a very cheap stapler that works well. If you're looking for a cheap stapler for light duty use, for $5 you can't go wrong with the the Swingline Standard Stapler, "Eco Version". If you're looking for a good basic stapler, then this is a great little option. I had to use a stapler removal to get the mangled staple out of my documents.Spend a little more and get one that won't jam as much as this piece of junk did!Skip! Although looking rather attractive it is nowhere nearly as sturdy as my previous stapler. This is the standard issued stapler for the Seattle Public Schools. What it is is a no nonsense stapler that is a good value, that hapPens to be made in part of recycled material if you are concerned about your &#34;footprint&#34; It is very lightweight and opens so you can use the stapler in a vertical position to staple papers up on a wall or board and makes an audible click when you put it back to its horizontal position.The bottom is rubberized and sits still as you staple. This isn't a stapler designed for heavy office use or class use, though it would certainly be fine for an individual student if you purchased it for your own child to use. This is your standard stapler, with biodegradable plastic, treated with Microban, and takes standard size staples. This is a great stapler from the stapler masters, Swingline.It takes normal, regular standard size staples that are sold at many stores.Recommended. A stapler is something that I always seem to need on hand and don't have one, so when given the opportunity to review one, I snatched it up.I love this one. It loads easily, and works just as you want a stapler to work.NOTE: It does not come with staples, so you'll need to order those separately. I like this stapler a lot. I can attest that this is an excellent stapler because I've owned this exact one for 10 years. Well, it's middleweight stapler at best. it is sturdy, doesn't get jammed it is a stapler... it works-- after all what more can you ask for The stapler was able to able to handle stapling 20 sheets easily for me, and even stapled through 40 sheets when I tested it out - although the staple had just barely made it. The stapler is very lightweight and plastic, but this didn't affect the quality of stapling.I've used this stapler several times now and haven't had an issues with jamming, knotting, or anything of the like. It performs well as a stapler and gets my kids worksheets held together solidly. The stapler also did not come with any staples - this was a minor annoyance as I had to go out and buy some. That aside, it does what a stapler is supposed to do, and keeps my papers all together. I suggest they show the stapler and the staples that fit that product in the same advertising space. This stapler generally work well. Overall, it's an okay stapler. I highly recommend this stapler by Swingline for your home office and general purpose needs. I was "issued" this stapler to use in my high school classroom. It is not a nice enough stapler for a coworker to steal. If, however, you are just needing a stapler to have in case you need to staple something, this stapler is perfect. I received this stapler just after my last Swingline died. The stapler works as well as I would expect a stapler to work. I wanted just a basic stapler near the printer, a well priced item! He really likes this stapler. I have a heavy Swingline stapler on my desk and my grandchildren keep taking it. This is an awesome stapler and I really can't believe it's so inexpensive! This is a decent made-in-China stapler that claims to be 50% recycled materials. This stapler might be useful at home with small numbers of pages -- 10 or less -- but people tend to avoid using it in a busy office -- they don't seem to trust that it will really staple 15 or so pages -- they tend to go to the bigger staplers.Tough to review -- it works ok on a test basis, but is often found buried behind all kinds of other stuff.The jury is out here.Robert C RossMay 2014 I was very surprised and disappointed when this stapler arrived and, using the same SF4 Swingline staples, it had trouble stapling through packets of paper that never gave my other staplers any trouble. It staples well, looks decent, and well, that is about all a stapler has to do. A stapler isn't a very exciting office product, though I'm sure they were very exciting when invented in the late 1800s. I've never been a stapler slapper - I'm gentle with all my tools - so I don't know how well it works if you slam your hand or fist on the top. .This elegantly pretty stapler now has a home in my desk drawer beside a couple of other models, including the classic 747 model. If you use your stapler to staple on walls (we do at our elementary school) or other large surfaces, it could be problematic. But this stapler is lighter and has more plastic. This stapler also comes with a one year limited warranty, compared to the lifetime limited warranty of the 747. This new stapler is smaller and lighter weight than my first one, but it works wonderfully. It's just a regular stapler.I
