It sticks to the desk without moving and, WITHOUT the aid of an adhesive. It's sleek, elegant, and easy to wipe clean, making it the perfect desk accessory for those with allergies or neatnik tendencies.I like the firmness of the 3M Gel Wrist Rest... it's not as spongy as my other wrist rests, and yet provides just the right kind of support for me.Thanks to its small footprint, weight, and size, the 3M Gel Wrist Rest is great to take on the road when traveling.Highly recommended! If you aren't seated properly at a desk, however, and your keyboard is situated higher than the bend of your elbows, you're more likely to come into contact with an edge, since the support is just under 3/4 inches high. It feels good, and doesn't move around on your desk. It sits on my desk and stays put with a simple bottom that adheres to the surface without leaving a residue. It's not going to easily travel around on the desk, and it's very supportive.2. It does not slide on my wooden desk. These are really great, particularly for desk setups that aren't ergonomic. I am worried it will bleed into my desk. I had thought perhaps this would be great on my desk, which is very dark chocolate brown.It looks great on the desk, and with my computers. It also is small enough to fit inside my desk if I wish. The 3M has been on desk at work for over a month and so far it works just like new and offers a nice firm support.
