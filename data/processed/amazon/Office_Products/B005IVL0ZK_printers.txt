I have been using Epson printers for many years and a solid product. I may be bias because I love Epson printers but this printer is great! As typical for Epson printers it does take four separate ink cartridges  which you can replace individually or all at once. It's not one of those small cheap-looking printers, and I feel it's looks are an asset to any small office. Of the more than 20 or so printers I have owned this is the best yet. I have tried many printers in this Epson series and they all the same same things in common: easy installation, great print quality, intuitive easy to use controls, and pretty good software. I am also impressed with Epson printers after using this one. I've had other printers that made excellent photo prints, but this one equals them and it's many times faster.The set-up was extremely easy. As with most Epson printers, I find the photo quality to be decent for home printing. I have 2 Epson printers at this time, one of them a very high-end product and then this model 545 for everyday use. I have had other Epson printers and they are reliable workhorses--nothing fancy.
