I love the fact that I can scan a page on the printer and make it save directly to a PC on the network just by using the printer's touch display. It was, in fact, a major pain. I like the fact that there's a printer tray to hold the paper instead of putting in through the back of the machine. The fact that Epson doesn't promote this like crazy on the box, in the instructions, or anywhere else proves only that Epson is overly modest. In fact, scanning from the computer works perfectly and easily - simply run Apple's Preview software, select Import From Scanner from the menu, then select that again and choose the 840 as your source; you're immediately given a wide array of choices regarding how to scan.While we're at it, I installed the software using the provided CD onto my Mac running Snow Leopard (I haven't upgraded to Lion on my primary work machines for a variety of reasons, among which is that my Canon scanner would stop working and Intuit has failed to come out with a reasonable replacement for Quicken 2007). I like the fact that you can fit a whole ream of paper in either(there are two) paper trays. Regardless of this fact, I treat everything I review as if I actually bought it.The Epson WorkForce 840 is Epson's top of the line home office type printer. The fact that it came with outdated software and not-so-easy installing instructions, it's no wonder so many other users became super frustrated trying to set it up.

In fact, this is probably where I should mention that this printer is very fast.2.

I love the fact I can scan directly to my portable storage.I am 50/50 on whether I would recommend this printer.

The fact that it has a touch display on the front makes for independent wireless configuration rather tahn using clunky software (and this one is no exception to that).
