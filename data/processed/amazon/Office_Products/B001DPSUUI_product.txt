Love this product! They're sturdy and very clear when you look at the finished product. In doing my product tables for my books, I always need a good way to display signs to identify the types of books I write. A great product by Fellowes. This makes your end product much more durable, but also more bulky and less flexible. If you're going to fold or bend the product in any way, you should go with 3mil, since 5mil will be too stiff to do much other than lay it flat. The product worked great and there was no bubbling. This product sticks together by nature. *****This product is a product made by a company. A really great product. I would recommend this product. I had selected both this product and Fellowes Hot Laminating Pouches, Letter, 5 mil, 100 Pack (52040) to see what the difference would be, which would be better overall at least for me.
