There is even a software setting that helps to prevent or at least weaken the "see-through" effect one occasionally encounters when writing bleeds through and can be seen from the backside. The software provides a wider number of scanning and saving formats.In the fully automatic mode, the scanner is one touch and creates a black and white or color scanner depending on the image being scanned. I don't find either manual particularly clearly written, though.As I mentioned above, the Canon software is horrible. If you want to install the software, do a System Restore first because you may regret the software installation; I did. I ended up removing all the software because it was such a pain in the butt. The Caputure OnTouch software didn't detect when I plugged in the scanner, nor when I pressed the button. You're bugged to register with the software company every single time. The software sets itself to Auto Start. It tried to auto-update but failed.Instead, use the software that's stored in the scanner itself. On Mac the software started automatically but on Windows I had to click on USB drive image capture application icon to get it started.
