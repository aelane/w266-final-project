Although I can't ever recycle paper through the Xerox (it jams instantly), I do print on the backsides with the HP (which only jams often). Because this paper is smoother and stiffer, it jams much less often when recycled, sparing me considerable annoyance. Ever since I started using this paper the problem has disappeared. This paper, on the other hand, is tailor-made for those special occasions when attention to detail counts. I'll be sticking with my cheaper paper for draft and throw-away printing, but when quality counts, this is definitely my new go-to paper. I usually purchase the least expensive paper I can for my ink jet printer. So, this paper was quite a change! Do I like this paper? This is excellent general purpose paper. The paper is 24 lb paper. It's not photo paper but I use whatever paper is in the printer when I print a photo. There is little to distinguish this paper from any other quality paper from GP, Hammermill, IP, HP or any other mill. They all work hard to provide a quality paper from sustainable sources, and are made in the US or Canada.This paper does what it says it does. The paper feeds smoothly and prints cleanly. If you want a good 24 lb paper you can't go wrong with this one.For my money, though, I would continue to buy 20 lb rather than this 24 lb variety. While the paper fed smoothly, when the paper comes out of the printer it has that distinctive raw pulp odor while the sheets are still warm. The odor quickly dissipates once the paper cools, but no other paper I have run though this printer in over six years has given off any order.Bottom line: I would not buy this paper. This is a sturdy paper, perfect for my needs. This paper is nice, works great and the price is fair. Before trying this paper, I had been using a similar, but lighter weight Georgia Pacific 20 pound paper -GP Copy & Print Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches Letter Size, 92 Bright White, 20 Lb, 5 Reams/Carton (2500 Sheets) (998068C)The heavier weight of this 24 pound paper also gives it greater thickness. Georgia Pacific's paper is a nice weight, bright white color and doesn't jam, which covers all the bases. paper and this comes as a 24 lb. I really prefer the acid free paper and this product offers that feature.I noticed in some of the other reviews of this paper a reference to ridges. Great paper in a manageable size box. paper. We typically use paper from office supply stores, like Staples or Office Max. We have used this paper for several weeks to print everything from coupons, to recipes, directions and formal communication. The paper sits smoothly in the tray and we have not had any difficulty with jamming, smudging, etc. UPS delivered the paper in excellent packaging. The paper is in perfect condition. The GP 998072C paper is noticeably thicker than most everyday papers that I have purchased. This paper is good if you need to appear very professional, such as in a legal office. Good paper, will use it often. Compared with (nearly) comparible paper from a membership club (Xerox 96 Bright, 24 lb., 800 sheets per reem, Premium Multipurpose) I prefer the Xerox. It's still good paper, about the same price. First I know this is paper so it really doesn't have many requirements to meet but I think this one does what most of us want. Second the paper was a good thickness for everyday printing and worked well in our laser printer. It works for us even if it is only paper. Great quality paper. You can't go wrong with this paper. As paper goes, this is a nice all-purpose paper for ink jet as well as laser printers. This paper is great...I kind of hate to waste it on every day printouts. Since using this paper, I became a fan of GP papers and continue to buy them locally and at Amazon. Some of the paper is cheaper online than at the local discount store! I typically use GP copy paper for home printing on my ink jet printers so when given the opportunity to test out the ink jet paper I was happy to try it out. I'll use up my lightweight paper for less important tasks, but this paper is for the times I need to impress. I like that I can handle the paper shortly after printing and the ink doesn't smudge. This paper is advertised as for both laser and jet ink printers. For some, just grabbing any paper and shoving it in the printer works just fine. And this is an ideal paper for making paper airplanes.Bottom Line:This bright white paper offers a professional look to all printing projects, yet it's reasonable enough for general draft and everyday use. It is thicker than the cheap paper you are probably used to using. This paper is just what it states it is; white 24-lb heavyweight paper. I generallly use Georgia-Pacific 20-weight paper which is adequate for all my needs.However, since paper needs vary based on use; this GP Ink Jet and Laser Paper in 24-lb weight/92 brightness is okay as heavier papers go. The paper has a nice heft to it and the color is fine. This paper feeds well and looks good in my ink jet printer (HP). There is better looking paper but it costs significantly more so is only used for "special" purposes. This paper is easy to print, feed and read. I'm not going to rave about paper, it's just not in me. It is considered heavy weight paper with a designation of 24 (by comparison, the standard runs more toward 20). However, the paper thickness does have its advantages. Again, I can't get too excited about paper. If you like your paper a bit thicker, as I do, this fits the bill. The recycled paper doesn't jam a lot but it does on occasion. I'm not a paper expert. Because the recycled paper is cheaper & better for the environment, I would recommend it over this if the quality of your documents is not a concern. Excellent printing paper for the ink jet printer. This paper works just fine in both types of printers (I have an HP Laserjet and a Lexmark duplex printer). The Georgia-Pacific paper is a touch rougher than the other brands because they tend to be used in laser printers whereas this item can absorb the inkjet printing and is a compromise. Using this paper in both inkjet and laser printers I've found that it compares favorably both in quality and value with other paper of similar quality and weight that I use. I got this paper for free as part of the Amazon Vine program. With paper costing so much these days, I was very happy to try this brand/product.The first thing I noticed was that the 3 reams were a lot heavier than 3 reams of the other Staples paper I normally use. I discovered that this is 24 weight paper, compared to the 20 weight paper I normally use. I do find that this Georgia Pacific paper does not jam as much as my Staples copy paper, especially when I am feeding it through the scanner, which is a huge plus.As far as pricing, I found some sales at the ofc supply store, but they are not available all the time. I definitely would recommend this paper to other business owners and individuals. First, I was surprised at how much paper was here - the box is huge! The paper itself is a tad thicker than what you normally buy if you buy a packet in the grocery store, and thicker than what we have at work also. It's not like resume paper, just a bit more substantial and higher quality than average paper. This paper has a great weight to it, almost pushing it into the realm of a light card stock but not quite.It runs through my little HP printer with ease, avoiding any paper jams and there was not smudging of ink at all. I'm glad I did as the paper is much better quality. My normal paper has a brightness of 88 and a weight of 20. This paper is made in the USA and is certified by the Sustainable Forestry initiative. This paper is a nice step up from that. The paper feeds fine through my laser printer, no jams, and the print looks great.My only quibble is the paper is on the expensive side but then it is a better grade than the standard paper I am used to buying so I understand there's a cost associated with using nicer paper. The paper is a good quality and it is packaged well.The closest I have to a complaint (and this is general issue) is that it comes in a box and Amazon then puts the box into another one to ship! I generally buy copy paper a ream at a time. Buying paper a ream at a time can be a hassle at times because, depending on your use, you have to go back and get another ream before too long. The paper never jammed either of my printers and it looks and feels durable and expensive. I never ordered printer paper from Amazon before, preferring to buy it from office stores. When I run out of this paper, I will definitely come back for more. The paper was just the right weight for my printer and worked great. This is a bright white paper, heavy enough for double-sided printing, with a crisp finish just right for everyday printing.It's acid free, so documents will last, and it's made in the USA as part of the Sustainable Forestry Initiative.This is not a paper that will make recipients of your documents stop and stroke the page admiringly, but it's a good workhorse paper for everyday use. This GP paper produces very good quality printed pages. grade paper has been used by us in both our ink jet and laser printers and the results are commendable. The paper comes as three reams per carton, perfect for storage purposes. It's stronger/thicker than copy paper and takes ink well so that the ink doesn't bleed through when you print on both sides.It has a sleek feel to it.The ink dried quickly on the pages that had full color images.It's packed 500 pages to a packet.It's acid free. This paper is very white (92 brightness) and a heavier quality than the standard copy/printer paper we usually buy. This particular paper goes through all the machines - from the cheap black and white to the expensive full photographic color printer with ease. I've used this paper with black ink and color layouts, and everything is crisp and sharp.In a small business, especially, we don't want any additional, little problems - like sticky paper or unprofessional looking,fuzzy documents. It does not really appear any different than my normal copy paper, although it feels sturdier.Where this shines, though is that it is acid free, so for any copying that you want to preserve for scrapbooks, recipes or letters this is much more preferable. This "Ink Jet and Laser" paper has a heavier weight at 24lbs for everyday documents, but is not as bright as I am accustomed to.

Normally I buy recycled paper by Georgia-Pacific.

Therefore it is easy to retrieve more paper when I need it & very convenient to store.From what I can tell it is no brighter than the recycled paper at 92 brightness.

My usual paper is 20.I think it is the weight of the paper that gives it the nicer feel.
