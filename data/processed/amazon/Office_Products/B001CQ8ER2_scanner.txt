It is just a fancy scanner, and even then, the scanner only works well with papers that are the same size as the pre-alloted slots - and as you know, not every receipt, card, bill, etc. I was really looking forward to getting this scanner since the paperwork pile I amass each month running my business seems to be growing exponentially. The scanner jammed repeatedly, or pulled the paper askew, which ruined the scan. This scanner is supposed to be an accessible and easy family scanner that anyone can use. The sheet-fed scanner takes much less space on a desktop than a flatbed, and it can scan both sides of a sheet at the same time. The ADF scanner sits on top of the output tray, but the tray is not attached in any way; I would prefer that the tray attach to the scanner. I was excited to get this scanner and accompanying organization software, and I was sure I would absolutely love it. I've been practicing with my scanner for a while now and everything I need it to do, it does. I'm very happy with this scanner and I'm beginning to file as much as I can online. This is a handsome little scanner!When I opened the box, there was an easy-to-read folder with directions, CD, and cleaning cloth. The scanner itself takes up very little desktop space, and has a nice, clean look.Each slot (paper, receipts, cards) hold up to 10 items, so you can actually process 30 pieces of paper at a time. This scanner is marketed to small businesses, and while I do not happen to run one of those, it does appear to be a really nice item for organizing business expenses. The scanner processed this perfectly and the software read everything correctly.5) For chuckles, I fed in a MegaMillion lottery ticket (a loser, sadly). It was completely chewed up and caught in the scanner mechanism. The scanner was undamaged and I fed in another document, which processed just fine.Now I tried out some of the software options...Once the receipts were in the scanner database, there were numerous export options. !This scanner is unbelievable. Why do I need a second scanner for this? Simply put, the NeatDesk scanner isn't even in the same class as a business tool. Basically, this is a scanner where you then need to enter 95% of everything manually. This is basically just a scanner. I evaluated this scanner from the approach of a small-sized business (30 employees), and also from a personal standpoint.
