:-(Since I am using the printer by having it connected directly to my MAC by a USB cable not not my WiFi, I am not able to take advantage of some of the cool features like printing from my cellphone or iPods with the Kodak Flick App. Not only did the printer install, it automatically updated the firmware of the printer from Kodak. My old printer used to spray or smudge the paper on occasion and was prone to paper jams on its more tempermental days. I'm VERY satisfied with this fantastic printer and delighted with how well she operates. Ths is a nice printer. This printer locks up even though want you would want to print is only black. This printer replaced an Epson that I was just fine with, I had no complaints, but I've been very pleased with this Kodak printer in comparison. I wouldn't have considered a Kodak printer in the past, I always thought Epson & HP and such were the better printer brands, but this Kodak model has me thinking otherwise.I'm a paper crafter (professionally) who needs HIGH quality printed images and also LOW ink cost - this printer happily meets both needs. Turns out Kodak makes a nice printer :)UPDATE 12/27/11: Last week this printer's printer head broke down on us (it stopped printing yellow), which was a major disappointment considering we haven't been using this printer for very long. It's not a $300 printer, but at around $100, it's a 5/5 compared to its competition with the HPs and Epsons, in my opinion. Kodak claims that with this printer and their ink, I can print a 4X6 high quality photo for about nineteen cents. The printer is dependable and ink cartridges are very reasonably priced, so I was very interested to see what improvements were made to this model, the 2170.The appearance is markedly different being both significantly larger and having all controls placed on the front panel. First, unpack the printer and decided rather than reading the instruction booklet, to instead use the one page Start Here guide. With my older Kodak printer, I had a problem after a month and the customer service was impressive. I was immediately sent a new printer and a shipping label included for return of the old printer. My old Kodak printer is a little workhorse and I will be judging this one with the same expectation.If I encounter any problems with the printer, I will up-date this review. I'm going to use the printer to print and frame photographs I take. (My HP printer did recognize the paper and allowed me to print instead. I find I have to disconnect the printer from the wall socket in order to resume the wifi use.Overall, it is a great start for Kodak. The printer leaves a fairly small footprint on my desk and is quieter than many other printers. When I click on it, it basically reinstalls the printer. So we have decided to use this printer as a backup only and have gone back to using our HP printer.In addition, we purchased color & black ink cartridges 3x before using up even one ream of paper. This is nice printer and it claims that low print cost.
