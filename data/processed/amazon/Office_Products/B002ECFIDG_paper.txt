This wastes paper and is bad for the environment.Now I don't have to reprint those pages, because I have the Avery removable labels. And to peel it off the paper page, if I don't remove the tab--which however can also be done.The one drawback is that my notes are often fairly long, my handwriting is large, but these labels are quite small. It is lightweight: placed on paper with text, the text will show through faintly, but enough to be legible. When applied to paper, the labels were still attached after 24 hours. The entire paper is sticky and then there is a convenient tab (you can see on the right of the image) that breaks away after the label is positioned.I was interested in trying this brand as an alternative to Post-Its, because some pens that I have don't write well on Post-Its. The paper is printed on the outside with a leather-like pattern. They are not attached to shiny label paper to discard once the label is peeled off. They do not use recycled paper or soy-based ink, however they have found a way to avoid much of the excess paper waste associated with labels. The paper is 80% post-consumer recycled material and the overall quality is excellent. When applied on flat paper, it will stay put but if it is removed and placed elsewhere, the second adhesion is much weaker.Think of this as more of a Post-it note rather than a label. On paper, envelopes, kraft/manilla items, they stick and remove fine. These have replaced all of our paper bookmarks for now, because they do not fall out on their own. But, they do stick well enough on paper and do remove well and easily.I tried the labels for other uses, those not intended by the manufacturer. They worked very well on paper, wood (laminate) and cardboard.
