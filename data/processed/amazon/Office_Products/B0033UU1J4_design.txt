Plus the vertical design is really much better, easier to use and almost no effort because gravity is on the user's side. Plus, it has that cool design. I'd never buy it for the design but if it looks good while doing a great job that is just a bonus. I love the design too it looks great in my room. It has a sleek design and doesn't take up much space. Contemporary design. The design still prevents the sharpener from chewing up pencils, so this is not a big deal.Notes: The sharpening angle appears to be standard and is not adjustable. First off, I findthe design to be quite interesting and purposeful. I really like the design. The design is cool in that you have the ability to see into it as it works and how full the pencil shaving container is. As it is a vertical design, it shifts around a bit, during use. It has an attractive, sleek design and looks good on a desktop or shelf. That's design success.But the problems started when the pencil went in. It seems that this snug-fit design is intentional, to ensure that the pencil aligns perfectly with the blades. This sleek design does save space on your desk. This design makes more sense and I like it quite a bit.Bottom line: Good looking and simple, but not perfect. The upright design makes it small enough to fit almost anywhere. I really liked the design feature that causes it to stop sharpening once it reaches a sharp point. I'm leaning towards a design flaw in this case.
