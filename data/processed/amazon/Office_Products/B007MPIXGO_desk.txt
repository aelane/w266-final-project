The portable desk came exactly as described.It has a 4 port usb hub and a little led book light which is a nice touch. When I first put it together, I was actually using the desk backwards lol. It's a great desk for the price. This laptop desk top is 21" by 16". The Tsir Tech laptop desk is small, simple, and practical.The desk requires some assembly. This desk is quite easy to assemble, but there were a couple of small glitches. This desk, untilted, is 59.70cm  (23.5") from the floor to the lip of the desk. A very stable desk stand with extra LED light and a cooling fan. You can tilt the desk from horizontal or towards you. This laptop desk is a good value for the money. The TSIR Tech desk is nice with an adjustable top angle and a installable lip to keep laptop computers or whatever from sliding off the top when it is at an angle.

ASSEMBLYThis little desk came to me in a lightweight flat box.

I couldn't tell there was a desk inside.

I really enjoyed revising this desk.
