We want quality; speed is not relevant to us.MEDIA:We tested the Pro-10 with several different high-quality inkjet photo stocks from HP and Canon, plusInkpress Rag, Cool Tone Double Sided, Bright White Matte Inkjet Paper, 24 mil., 300gsm, 13x19", 25 Sheets. I was very pleased with the overall quality of the resolution and color renditions. Color/Print Quality are different than they are on the Epson R3000 while both still being very high quality. They are looking to make high quality prints to either sell or frame and hang on their walls, and in either of those instances the Canon Pro-10 will allow you to get not just lab quality prints, but perfect prints.I highly recommend this printer. The quality of full-size prints is absolutely astonishing, and well beyond what a typical consumer (like yours-truly) could ever need. Before I go into the quality of this printer, I want to address the fact that this printer is an investment in more ways than the price.Size------This printer is large ... very large. Built like a tank.+Fantastic quality paper feed path, will take nearly any paper easily-Cannot print roll paper-Since it is pigment, less variation in finishes as ink sits on top of the paper.-Must be turned on every other week to prevent clogging. Built like a tank.+Fantastic quality paper feed path, will take nearly any paper easily-Cannot print roll paper+Since it is dye, your prints will more closely take on the characteristics of the paper it is printed on as the ink is absorbed into the paper.+Can sit for over a year without printing or being turned on with no clogsEPSON R2000 - MSRP $599-PIGMENT based printer+Excellent quality on Fine Art & Matte paper+Very good color, but not as much pop/dynamic range as dye+Excellent black & white-Very good quality on Gloss, Semi-Gloss, and Luster paper-Non-matte paper requires an extra overcoat of gloss, which is one of the replaceable ink tanks. Far better quality prints and built to impress. I don't know if it's the quality of the printer or the quality of the inks (likely both) that creates such stunning results, but everybody who sees prints from this machine is knocked out. Finally I could make high quality, large format prints at home. The quality seems excellent to my eye, though it will take a little time to calibrate the print colors to what I have on my screen. * Uses quality pigment inks (though expensive!
