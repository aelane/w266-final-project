This replaced an Epson Workforce 600 which wasn't bad...but was hard to load paper, would not do automatic double sided printing and would not print on CDs. The paper output tray slides into the printer, to be stored out of sight when not printing, to reduce the overall footprint of the printer. 10, DL, C6, plain paper, bond paper, air mail* Input Paper Capacity:  Main Tray = 120 sheets max (10 envelopes) / Photo Tray = 20 sheets premium photo paper* Dimensions (W x D x H):  18.4" x 15.2" x 7.5" (pull-out paper output extends depth to 23.0")* Weight:  23.8 lbs. However, Epson photo paper is not any more expensive than HP or Canon papers, and when using the compatible papers this printer really does produce lab quality photos. I like the internal paper tray, however I was disappointed that it did feel kinda flimsy - but I'm sure as long as you don't man-handle it then it will hold up just fine. The paper worked great.The printer did not come with a USB cable, but does include a supply of ink.What I did last year, and what I will do again this year, is print out some small photos and use the photos instead of gift tags for presents. The paper path is designed to present both sides to the print heads so care is required.Don't load creased sheets.Don't load paper normally good only for wrapping fish in.Don't reload paper after it has been through the printer once.Don't overload the cartridge.And use The Old Printer's Trick to break the vacuum between the sheets: grip the pack on one short edge, bend the pack and grip the other edge. This works much better than just fanning the paper, as it makes each page slip against its neighbors.You'll need some of these:Epson Claria T098120 Hi-Definition 98 High-capacity Inkjet Cartridge-BlackEpson Claria T098920 Hi-Definition 98 Extra High-capacity Inkjet Cartridge Color Multipack-Cyan/Light Cyan/Magenta/Light Magenta/YellowBuy two sets if you use the printer every day or print many photographs, otherwise you'll be driving all over the place one Sunday looking for a light magenta cartridge and cursing up a blue streak. Loading paper is done internally so you cannot see how much stock you have left which is a shame but I can live with it.

The paper didn't seem to absorb the ink properly, and produced a very splotchy looking print.

However, the Epson paper produced excellent results.

For plain paper printing, I didn't notice any difference between HP, Hammermill, or Epson papers.
