Good self seal envelopes. The self adhesive is sticky enough and is nice to not have a strip of paper to throw away when sealing the envelope. The self adhering is a nice feature, just life the folded area up and it reveals the adhesive to seal the envelope so there isn't anything to throw in the garbage. I really like the self stick feature, it seems more secure then the usualy envelope seals that you like/wet to seal. The self seal design is good for one at a time usage. I've used other self sealers that could be easily opened (by someone that was not supposed to open it) and resealed.Dislikes: About the only negative I found, and I'm getting very nitpicky, was that the box these come in is a flimsy.Overall:  Nice envelopes that work well. Then you have the self adhesive envelopes. The self adhesive makes all the difference. Also the self adhesive strip seals securely. The self adhesive is a sticky strip under a waxy flap, so there is nothing to peal and toss. Very durable self sticking envelope that is truly tamperproof. Basically what you get is a self sealing envelope with little slits on the flap so if you try to open it in a way that allows you to re-seal it, the envelope tears and you know someone tried to open it.That part works, its pretty hard to open it without having one of those perforations rip, so thats good.Whats bad is that the glue isn't that secure. The self adhesive is easy to use and they have a nice print on the inside that would make it a little more difficult to see what is in the envelope. I expected typical self seal envelopes that required you to pull off a strip of paper, then stick down the flap. The self seal feature is cleverly designed so there is no strip to tear off and throw away.
