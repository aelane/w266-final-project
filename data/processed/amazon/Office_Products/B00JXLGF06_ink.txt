Secondly, it goes through an ink cartridge every 30 pages. This should be a real ink and cost saver. That's fine with me, but after installing the ink and closing the access door, a message told me that it was initializing and it could take about six minutes. * The ink cartridges are small. We had to replace the ink 3-4 times a year even with frugal use. The ink tanks seem quite small compared to my other printers. The ink is not as water resistant as laser, but it is definitely much more water resistant than previous experiences I have had with ink jet ink which runs on contact with water. Finally, I've never liked how long it takes to prime a new Epson ink cartridge, so if you run out of ink during a deadline... plan to waste an extra 5-10 minutes.But for the price I still find the feature set, connectivity and image quality unbeatable and can easily overlook the cons and highly recommend this model. Installing ink was a snap, though I'm increasingly tired of the instructions with pictures model that seems to be the norm. Epson offers ink for sale at the best prices at the time of this review and is offering free shipping. The ink is essentially dry when the page comes out on all but the most densely printed pages. However ink for this printer costs double what I usually pay and the XL cartridges are not easy to find either. Setup is relatively easy and the ink, though fairly expensive, seems to last for a fair amount of time.
