I ended up pre-ordering this desk at half the price currently shown on Amazon. This desk looks sharp for the price and goes together fairly easily.The craftsmanship could be better. This all being in Montana so it may or may not be understandable.The desk looks wonderful in all black. Update*** Amazon has been selling this desk recently with prime shipping for $79. So really look around, this desk is apparently sold for many different prices! I like the desk however...but would have liked it more at the lower price. The desk however is nice and worth around $80-$100. Of that I am not certain.This desk is easy to assemble and looks nice and sturdy when complete. not the greatest desk, and dissapointed i overpaid. The desk is sturdy, now that it's built. If you buy the desk, cross your fingers that you don't have any issues! This desk was perfect for me. The desk is NOT USABLE like this. This desk is well made, he glass is thicker than I imagined, and it is very sturdy. That said, this desk isn't particularly difficult - just time consuming.Taking it slow and following the diagrams and instructions most anyone can assemble this desk and make final adjustments in less than two hours.Quick Specs:1) All measurements are true to size as advertised.2) Arrives well packaged and Protected3) Instructions and diagrams are clear4) All parts are numbered for easier assembly5)  Thick tempered glass6) Stable and solid - a feel of quality7) Light steel and clear glass is a marvelous aesthetic - the desk is not a focal point8) Fits perfectly in any corner, takes up little room9) Good size working area ( mine is holding a 17" laptop, laser mouse and pad, desk accessories, a printer/scanner, a file holder, paperwork) and still looks clean and uncluttered.10) Surprisingly well machined and above average build quality - no ill fitting parts and everything matches up beautifully with little effort.A few days before I had bought the Alera leather Captains high back office chair (also on Amazon) and probably the best deal on a high quality all leather chair you'll find anywhere. But I thought it would be too large to  fit comfortably under the desk. The desk arrives with the contents very well packaged and organized I bought this to replace a desk I had since i was a kid. Overall, this is a pretty good desk.T
