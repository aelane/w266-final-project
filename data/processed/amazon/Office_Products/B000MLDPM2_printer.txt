I have had this printer a couple weeks, prints look good so far. Overall, I think this is a really good printer for the amateur photographer. I have been testing this printer for a week or so, with a Windows XP based system. The printer has a USB and PictBridge socket. If you've installed a printer before, this one won't be a challenge. This is a large printer but capable of printing up to 13" X 19" prints. I highly recommend this printer. Overall, this is a very nice printer. I had been using this older printer and needed to be replaced. And it didn't take long before I was back to square one on that particular printer. The printer takes up a bit more real estate than we've come to expect single-purpose printers to do these days but this is more than made up for by the prints which are comparable to what you get processing through a retail store.A very nice photo printer at a reasonable price. The printer comes with drivers but it is almost always best to ignore those and go online to get the most recent releases. Buried in the printer dialog box is a tab labeled Maintenance. You have to tell the printer what kind of paper you're using. This printer retails for $300. This printer is just about on par with that one with some upgrades.The installation was a snap and the Epson software is among the better printing software packages out there. This printer creates high quality results...at significant expense. Another plus is that this printer prints much much faster than my R300 - easily twice as fast, which is really nice. This printer lacks that functionality and I find that I miss it.All in all, this is a great printer if you need to print larger long-lasting prints.B
