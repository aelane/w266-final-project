That's probably because they come together differently than most binder rings. But these rings join in a male/female fashion, which means it is far less likely that papers will catch at the place where they join. The rings are easy to open and close and it has two pockets, one on each cover. But these are not really special features.The rings are not really circular but more D shaped and do seem to work a little better, fit well, open and close easily.One thing:  it seems that some reviews for this binder might have a different model or whatever, one person mentions no back pocket, mine has one. The rings close together tightly with no gapping and easily open with the metal edge tabs. The D-shaped rings make it easy to turn pages within the binder compared to round-ring binders.I'd much rather buy a high quality binder like this than buy a less expensive one that I need to replace because it starts falling apart or doesn't work right. The rings are precise, with no overlap to interfere with turning pages because of the use of male/female intersects, instead of overlap. Also, the rings help prevent the paper from getting stuck, which was something that tormented me throughout my school years. The rings on this binder open and close with ease and I don't have to worry about it snapping my fingers. The rings are mounted on the back cover rather than the spine, which is much better. The rings are solid and line up well. With the rings on the back cover rather than on the spine this binder is great for keeping important papers organized neatly. The rings are great too-- not only can you pack a lot of material into it, the pages turn very easily and don't tear. The rings are not located on the middle section, I find it odd that some binders are still made that way, thus making it easier to put papers in and take them out, especially if you're planning on filling up this binder and are going to be using it on a daily basis. The rings inside are shaped to reduce backflow and gapping. The rings open with a lighter touch than standard binders, which makes it nicer than the regular Avery or other office store brand binders.

The rings have not taken any impact and haven't been opened/closed an excessive amount of time, yet the middle ring does not close entirely without me squeezing it shut.

Perhaps I opened the rings by pulling on the middle one too often (something I try not to do), but I've never had binder rings wear out this quickly, not even with more use.

The rings themselves are a compromise between C & D rings and work very well.
