I was able to set this printer up and connect it to my wi-fi network without ever physically connecting it to a computer - which is exactly how it should be. Remember, this printer does NOT print in color, so while it is affordable for home use, I assume the target market is small businesses who only need to print in monochrome, and also be able to scan and copy.The print quality is excellent, producing crisp text outlines that appear much more precise than my inkjet printer. We appreciate that the printer scans as well as copies; much nicer than having multiple devices taking up space and using electricity. First I'll say that I HATE that this printer is only b & w! I went to the printer a few feet away to press a key to get started and installation was DONE by the time I got back to the computer! The printer will help and you can print odd numbered pages, then turn the group to print the even sides but, if you're like me, you've been spoiled by printers that do it for you. Once the printer had been connected via the wireless process (SO easy! While the printer isn't noisy, it does make a noticeable hum when warming up. This printer was very easy to install and connect wirelessly with my Toshiba laptop OS 8.1. We haven't used this printer enough times yet to know if it will be problem free so until I get more experience with it I'm giving it 4 stars. This was a light, basic little printer with all the features I would want. After I figured that out though, the printer works great. I also GASP, like that it is not a COLOR printer. Not so with the Samsung.Overall, I like this printer. We definitely will be using this printer a lot. This printer is replacing an HP OfficeJet printer I had that would continuously have problems with print quality and even just connecting to new devices over Wifi.The first thing I noticed when setting up this printer is it just feels/looks like a quality device.

This printer is to be dedicated to my 2 Apple products but found it also works flawlessly with all my Windows 8.1 computers as well so no idea what is holding my newest Brother Multi Function Laser back but I really have no desire to dig into that since this is just fine.Setup was just 5 minutes or so and NO glitches, NO headaches and nothing to leave me scratching my head.

This is my first Samsung printer and I must say that I am very impressed.
