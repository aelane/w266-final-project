So far, I have used the printer, the scanner, and the copier functions, and all of them have worked flawlessly. I've had it with having to buy a new printer on a yearly basis. I liked the MX432, it was a good printer and I had no complaints other then it was difficult to navigate because of the limited screen used to configure it. With this printer the screen is not a digital display rather a 2 line LCD calculator style display. This printer it took me a while to figure out how to enter my wifi WEP key manually as I don't use the "one button setup. I want a printer that not only looks good as this one does but also is built solid. Nothing really exceptional and it isn't the worst printer I've ever owned. If you are looking for a printer that can do it all, you'll find it with the Canon Pixma MX512. This printer is perfect for the small business, home business, or for the home. Having a wireless printer is such an asset when you work on a laptop. The printer can be connected to a computer with a USB cable (sold separately). Great printer scanner  fax wireless  AirPlay  at great  price point , and the cartridges make an outstanding combination that just can't be beat. I do wish the printer included a read feed option, so as to have two different paper sources. That printer looking to be replaced by another laser professional soon, I got the Canon PIXMA for scanning and color opportunities.My office being two floors away from the scanner I've always had to use, I wanted a very local alternative to get me a quick .pdf file when an urgent document required transmittal. This printer was easy to set up and works great. As usual, this printer looks really nice, with a compact oval shape and a glossy black exterior. Functionally, this printer is fine. It is really more printer than the average home user will ever need, but that is OK. Getting the printer setup for wireless was really easy too. The printer is a bit on the heavy side but that i'll guess is because its not all plastic inside and there's more metal components.One great feature is that the inks get loaded from the front panel. This is a pretty good printer, and a decent scanner, and the ethernet network works well too. Sure enough, according to Canon's OnScreen User Manual for this printer and the online articles I read, the Canon's MP Navigator EX is a lot more capable than ImageCapture -- supporting, for example,  such features as multi-document or multi-picture batch scanning, and post-scanning image manipulation. If the printer will not be used for a while, it would be better to unextend the paper trays' tabs, so that the front cover door can be secured properly. This Canon printer is better than the one I have upstairs and I really did need one for this computer too as it's a pain when hubby or my daughter wants to use the printer the same time I do.

The Canon Pixma MX 512 printer is an office machine designed for the home according to the manufacture's description.

The printer is a bit complicated in design and that may be more problematic than beneficial for home usage.

My previous printer was a Canon MP640 and I liked it very much, but without the AirPrint capacity it is being retired.The Canon MX512 impresses me this way:Pros:It is packed with features.The machine looks good and it is well built.The control panel with the little status screen is as good as the need for it exists.The quality of the printed documents and photos is excellent.It is really not as noisy as other reviewers have claimed.The on-screen user manual is one of the best I have seen.
