They adhere nicely and remove easily without marring or tearing the folder or file. You can bend the folder around the other way, then put something on that tab and use the folder again. That works smoothly and leaves the folder in perfect shape - as advertised.The only downside is the recommendation that you not run the sheets through your printer more than once, perhaps because the bending will eventually result in labels popping off and getting stuck in your printer innards. OK, these are file folder labels. File folder labels are useful both for office and home organization and it is easy. These are also more expensive than your standard folder labels. They fit the folder tabs perfectly and don't smear when I write on them with magic marker. Other than that, what is there to say about file folder labels? File folder labels, yes, but with so many other possibilities. I was even able to use them for my hanging folder tabs simply by sticking them onto the cardboard tab and folding the excess length across the back. Rather than dumping the folder at the end of the semester, I just change the label.These labels do a good job.

It was convenient to be able to use the same folder and not have to use one of those annoying plastic tabs and try to find the stupid paper insert to write the label on, nor have to either find another label to cover the old one up like if using a permanent folder label solution.

they really do remove and adhere to another folder quite nicely, so these can come in very handy in many situations if you're wiling to pay a bit more for.
