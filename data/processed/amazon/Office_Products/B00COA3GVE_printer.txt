My other Laser printer cost about $59 for a generic that would last three years. But, like my last printer, prices seem to come down as time goes by, so I'll keep my fingers crossed.I am happy with the performance so far and the future with this Samsung is looking bright. I haven't looked that up on this printer. ***Although it may seem that this printer (Pro Xpress M3320ND) is wireless, it is not. After having adjusted may settings from the printer I could not get EVO to print correctly. For most this printer will fill a need for simply a printer that works, operates for a very long-time and is minimal in usage and prints fast. This printer does not deviate from its previous line of Samsung's fantastic black and white laser printers and should be the first choice when you are looking for just that. I thought this printer would be perfect for me. And so now I'm stuck with a really nice looking printer that I can't actually USE until I find a cable.EDIT: Okay. I am primarily using this printer for homeschool assignments. This printer helps a lot because of its features. I have been satisfied with this printer as a regular network printer for printing from a laptop, but Air Print and Cloud Print work intermittently. I also find that accessing the printer interface via typing in the port name into the browser is not well explained by the manual. Very convenient!I recommend this printer highly, but with the caveat that if you require flexibility on the placement location, you will be happier with the wireless model. printer available! This printer seems faster than most others I've had and I am impressed with the quality of the printing. You can connect this printer directly to your computer using a USB cable, or if you like to share or access it over a wireless network, connect it with an ethernet cable to your router. Because this printer is for my personal use only, I did not attempt to test these features.At the time of this review, this printer was going for about $90 and the standard- (MLT-D203S) and high-yield (MLT-D203L) toner cartridges for it were going for about $67 and $114, respectively, so high cost of toner can be a concern. And with my favored Brother DCP-7065DN printer next to my bed I am sick of being jolted awake when they wake it up and it takes off....I have my home office set up there and have no intention or good reason to relocate it. The printer has the capability to take jobs from a tablet or phone. It&#8217;s footprint isn&#8217;t that big compared to my old printer.
