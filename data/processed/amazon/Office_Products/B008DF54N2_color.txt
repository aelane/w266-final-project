And the green color is vibrant and eye catching. Love the bright green color and there is a lot of length on this roll too. It sticks securely and the bright color makes it draw your eye immediately. The color I have, sort of a lime green, is pleasing to the eye and easy to spot on any item I have labeled.Like other reviewers I think the dispenser is a bit cheap looking and it has a tendancy to not cut the tape in a straight line. The bright color is attention-getting, so you can use it to label things in the kitchen or elsewhere.I suppose it's relatively cheap, but then again, so are regular Post-its. I also like the color because it's easy to see. I really like the bright color because it draws attention to the label. Can you tell that I really like this color?The manufacturer's (post-it) packaging says "Use it as a note - Use it as a label", yet there are probably many more uses for it than that. Plus, the bright color draws the eye quickly to the label. The color is light so the contrast with the ink is very good. I like the bold green color. I love the bright green color and it's easy to write my labels on with a Sharpie pen. The green color is easily noticeable. The bright green color is easy to spot. I understand why, but perhaps that diminishes its usability.Finally, I like the bright green color and the dispenser's compactness for my desk or in a drawer. I love the great bright color and the quality of it and am already ordering more!

It is easy to write on and the color is eye-catching.

The green  color makes it particularly noticeable, which I prefer to the yellow Post-its which are not as visible.

Also, the color is nice and bright, and I like the tape dispenser format.The only thing I would change is I would give it a better cutting edge so that when you cut the pieces you get a straight edge.
