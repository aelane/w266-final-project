This automatic shredder is a great idea that is not automatic enough to be as useful as it wants to be. This shredder does that most of the time and also supports the use of paper bags to easily dispose of the shreddings into recycling. Having just purchased a shredder a few weeks ago, I didnt think I'd need another one, but figured what the heck it would be useful for the office. I know this is a personal shredder, but I wouldn't mind using this in my small business as well. This is not my first shredder. It is my first Swingline shredder, as well as the first stackable shredder I've owned.ABOUT THE EX100:The product is manufactured in China and is about 17" high, 12" wide, and 17" deep. I have another shredder made by Fellowes which does a great job. Also, this is the first shredder I haven't needed to oil, so that's a huge plus. The shredder jammed on those when added to the 4 sheet thickness of the spreadsheet. So this shredder is a cross cut and the shreds are short enough for all but the most insidious thief to not shuffle through them and paste them back together. When I got this shredder I thought it was going to be cool. Now the shredder it's sort of bogs down on a standard envelope filled with junk mail. If you're going to buy one shredder (as most people will), then I would recommend the Fellowes or something similar to it. I always wanted to get a shredder for home use, so when this item came up for review, I jumped at the opportunity.It's been several months since I received it, I have to say this shredder has performed very well, better than what I had expected. I found the above shredder to be very user friendly and efficient. I would recommend this shredder to friends. I tried the shredder on a number of items - a stack of paper with exactly 60 sheets, junk mail, old bills, notebook paper - and it did an excellent job of shredding. And, since the shredder can overheat if used continuously for over eight minutes, (it has an indicator that will warn you if it is overheated) it can take a long time to shred a large pile of documents. Swingline even recommends against using standard shredder oil.The 5-gallon, pull-out wastebasket is easy to remove, but emptying it was a bit awkward, because of its long and shallow shape. A sample shredder bag was included in the box of the Stack-and-Shred, but I'm not a big fan of using proprietary bags for disposal. This shredder goes through paper quick as a snap. I think the shredder is happier if it simply encounters a staple embedded in a single sheet.As I mentioned, the bin which holds the shredded paper fills pretty quickly - and will shut down further grinding until emptied. This is a sturdy looking shredder (a foot to a foot and a half in length/width/height) and it has a nice design for shredding stacked papers. This shredder can also handle credit cards in a manual feed slot. This shredder is designed specifically for neatly stacked paper. this shredder can become a part of my studio if I decide to upcycle cast off catalogs.I recommend this quality shredder by Swingline for its ease of use, ability to shred hard plastic and staples, and for alternative uses such as the ones which I have mentioned.Empower yourself with this high quality shredder from Swingline! This shredder copies the iconic Swingline Red Stapler look and is a bit prettier than the standard utilitarian shredders. As with any shredder, if you don't empty the bin frequently, the pressure of the filled paper backing up onto the teeth will cause a nasty jam.Nowadays, you can't throw this stuff out in the trash because of identity thieves. So a good shredder is a MUST. If you have an older shredder (doesn't do cross-cut, doesn't handle volume) this is a good replacement. This shredder seems to be very well made and should last for a long time. I am comparing this to a Fellows traditional shredder that handles about 20 pages at a time. Below 25 a standard shredder is much better. Instead of jamming up the shredder however, the Swingline seems to have the intuition to know you've laid an envelope there and simply does nothing. I also used to empty out the shredder after every shredding session. So it's hard to fault the shredder for doing something that seems standard in the shredder world. It is also a very LARGE shredder and needs to be on wheels to move it around. I've been using this shredder for several months and it has not jammed once. With my old shredder I had to hover over it, feeding in 2-3 sheets at a time, which was a hassle when I had several papers to shred.I've loaded it with as many as 30 pages at once. My previous shredder was rather tall, almost the size of our kitchen garbage can with wheels. I think this shredder was designed for people who have a nice neat stack of papers that have never been folded. For a lesser priced shredder I could have tolerated this.. it did still make the job easier and had moments when it worked really well... but not enough that I could really trust it to keep on shredding and walk away. However, the shredder I received shreds no more than 10-15 sheets at a time. If the shredder gets through half without jamming up, you're very lucky. How sensitive is the automatic shredder to creases and wrinkles in the paper?4. This was enough to jam the shredder twice. So, I stopped the shredder, removed the jammed sheets, and tried again. If you shred more than that, you may want a bigger, more powerful shredder that can gulp 25 pages in one sweep (of course, those cost a whole lot more).Long writeup:After reading some of the other reviews, I put it through the paces that seemed to be areas of complaint:* Single sheet manual feedingI agree that this is awkward. I will gladly take this shredder over that one, just for the auto-feed tray. Use the $100 Fellows shredder, which can take 10 pages in one pass. Use the $1700 Fellow shredder. No more sitting there chatting with the shredder while you hand feed it instead of working!Seldom jams and these were probably my fault. The shredder works very well and is not very noisy. It comes with two different shredder options. I'm by no means a shredder expert. I have a regular shredder, it's fine for 3 pages at a time. What I love about this shredder is that you can put in a stack of paper and it will shread the entire stack. With the Amazon Basics shredder, I can shred up to eight sheets at a time, and it has never once jammed up on me. I can then use the shredder as a typical shredder and simply feed the material in through the top. This is a great shredder. You no longer have to stand by the shredder and individually feed 15 sheets of paper in at a time. If you use your shredder for shredding junk mail and small stacks of paper I prefer a faster shredder although this shredder will work.Visually the shredder looks really cool. This shredder provides at least a little bit of protection. The shredder itself seems acceptably sturdy, but the pull-out drawer/waste bin is flimsy. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the Swingline Stack & Shred shredder is even better than I thought it might be. Nope, not this shredder. The shredder handled credit cards (through the top feeder) and staples without making much more noise than it did for paper. I had to turn off the shredder then turn it back on to get it going again.
