It clamps well to my desk, extends without any leaning and swivels fine. My desk has a support bar 2 inches from the edge of the desk and this prevents the mount from being fully over the desk. Otherwise, I really like having my desk surface free for papers and such. The desk is involved but the monitor is committed. When I told him about it he was a little skeptical that it would work because the French desk is curvy and there really isn't much for anything to clamp to.The box came and was fun to open containing 5 smaller boxes inside one large brown cardboard one. After having my Ergotron desk mount arm for several years, I thought it was time for an upgrade.Since I currently use3M's Lever Adjust Keyboard Tray(AKT100LE), which is awesome, I assumed the 3M's dual swivel monitor arm would be the same. I feel like my desk just grew! Just make sure that your desk can accommodate the clamp, meaning you will need a little overhang or lip at the end of your desk. He found a desk that suited him and we put it together. As we put the desk together I was concerned that the arm wouldn't work because there is a small board at the back of the desk that is slightly raised. The desk mount can either be mounted as a "clamp style," which is most common, to attach to a flat surface or via "Grommet Type" to go through a hole in the desk.
