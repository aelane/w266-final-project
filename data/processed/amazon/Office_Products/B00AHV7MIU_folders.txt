The folders are very durable and should last longer than others since I can easily change the title on them. The folders are the usual GOOD Smead quality.But as for writing with a marker, yes, a white eraser will take MOST of the writing off. These folders have erasable tabs. I agree that it would be great if these folders came with an eraser. You would be able to reuse the folders instead of having to put labels on top or get new folders. Ah, I wish I would've had these folders at my last job. Although the folders are fine, what is the point of having erasable tabs when it only works with permanent markers? I re-use file folders. Prior to acquiring these erasable folders, I turned a used folder inside-out & wrote on the backside of the tab.Now, with the erasable folders, I do not have to do that - I just have to worry about mangling the file folder (which is the same weight as a standard Smead file folder & has the creases to adjust your file folder bottom).However, in order to use the erasable feature of the file folder, you have to have a permanent marker & a white eraser. You are buying folders and if you use the wrong eraser it's not the fault of the folder.Almost everyone has permanent markers around the house, but the fact that the Pentels are an Amazon Add-On makes them easy to put into your cart. If you need hanging folders, Smead also offers the erasableFastab Hanging folders(assorted sizes) with built-in erasable tabs. I find multi-colored folders a little distracting. These Manila folders have a few good advantages. You can revise and reuse these folders. Overall, these folders are very handy, and make life a little bit easier. Solid folders also-very durable.Good Product! But I found that using these special folders and letting my eyes pass over the neatness of a drawer-full of these provides a calming effect for me.The folders themselves are of a good weight and, like all Smead paper products that I have used, will last a long time. Smead's Erasable SuperTab folders are a type of manila file folder that has a nice size label area and a special labeling surface that allows you to write with permanent markers and erase them. These are actually the folders I would use every day.... The folders are sturdy, easy to label, with a large label tab, and will last forever. With these super-tab folders, you can label them with a regular sharpie permanent marker, and then use a normal pencil eraser to clear them to write something else. They're manila folders with large tabs that really stand out.The special feature is that the tabs have a plastic coating that makes them erasable and reusable. The folders are made in the United States of thin but adequate stock, which consists of at least ten percent recycled content, that is more than capable of sitting in a file basket or organizing drawer. Manila folders are available in hundred packs for the same price, so if I use each one of these file folders four times, theoretically, I would break even monetarily. or throwing out perfectly good folders because the tabs have been taped over too many times. I just wish I had found these folders sooner!Highly recommended, great product! I got really aggravated with the erasable folders. I would use the folders, but not invest in them if you really want the erasable part. These are quite functional folders and definite improvements over the traditional ones. Whatever need you have for folders, these should answer the call.

The new Super Tab folders are a great idea with a plastic film over the label area so they can be written on and then erased so they could be used over and over again.The cover for the product says permanent marker and white eraser required but not included.

These folders make a lot of sense for a micro-business or home office.
