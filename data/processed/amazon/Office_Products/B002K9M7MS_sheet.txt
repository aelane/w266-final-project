They peel from the sheet quickly and cleanly, adhere readily, and stay put when applied to the package. Once you've printed a sheet, fold it in the empty space in the middle, peel off the labels one by one, and apply them to the large envelopes or to the packages.You can also use the labels one at a time by typing on them with a typewriter, or writing on them by hand. They include a code sheet that gives the comparable Avery number to make it easy to set up the form. Then hold the label sheet behind the test page up to the light, and you will be able to tell if your print job will fit on the labels or not.So I do highly recommend these labels for your everyday needs. I also tested a sheet in my color inkjet photo printer, and again - they worked just fine through that printer.Since most of us use an Avery add-in tool to print labels (i.e, with WORD), the 3M labels clearly indicate which Avery template to use. Each sheet contains 10 labels for a total of 250 labels. You can feed the sheet through the printer after you print one or two labels to print more so there is no wasted labels if you only print onw or two at a time. There is not a template sheet included in the box to test the printer alignment - but this wasn't a problem for me. Nonetheless, there is a handy sheet with "printing tips" for those who have never printed labels before -- for those who are seasoned label printers, you can dump this right away.This is a convenient size for shipping packages -- 10 labels per page, each about the same size as a business card or credit card (2"x4"). But I fed a sheet through more than once with no problem. If you're like me, you'll pull a sheet out of the box, then have to find the box to double check the model number.The 3M website ([...]) has downloadable templates - you go to the site, select the "template" link (located under custom labels.) I also fed the same sheet through the printers several times (not recommended by 3M) and the labels still came out beautifully with no jamming.The adhesive is very strong.
