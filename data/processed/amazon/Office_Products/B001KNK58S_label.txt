I notice that the label backing is not recyclable. I noticed this when I tried to use Avery to cover up an existing label, and the existing label showed through quite a bit more than I can tolerate. All in all a super label. It shouldn't be complicated!They are super easy to peel & it's very simple to see where the label ends. They stick about as good as any other non clear label I have tried. Avery doesn't recommend running the same label sheet through the printer more than once, but I have done it and they still worked well (no peeling). This is a great no nonsense label. *Rounded label corners, not squared/pointed.

(and, in trying to keep GREEN) if an environmentally green label can't be used on a previously used envelope, how green is it?They ARE good in a sense, for example, if you place it incorrectly, you can peel it back off, they are truly "easy" peel, and can be reapplied elsewhere, reduce and reuse :)Just NOT good for covering mistakes, or for reuse of used envelopes.

First, I printed with an HP LaserJet 4050, which yielded a great looking label.

Second, I used an HP DeskJet 5650, which also produced a good looking label, although not quite as soon as the laser printer as was to be expected.
