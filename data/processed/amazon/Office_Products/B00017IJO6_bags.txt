These bags do a suitable job of collecting the shredded paper.The bags fit comfortably in the shredder, although the top hangs over the front of the bin and is visible. 100 bags is roughly a two year supply for me. The bags are similiar in size to ones you can purchase in a grocery store or Lowes or Home Depot. I purchased these bags at the same time as the shredder because I did not know if they were actually needed to catch the shreddings. The bags are placed over the removable shredder bin and when the bin is pushed back into place you are left with a view of an ugly plastic bag. Or, you can get 100 Glad bags of similiar size at Lowes for one half that amount. I give the Fellowes bags three stars for two main reasons. These bags are the ideal side for storing or disposing of the remains of shredded paper. These bags have been a big improvement over NO bags we had before. I worried when we got these bags that they would get caught on the sides of the shredder or be pushed down with the paper. Yes, these bags have lasted me through two shredders. The bags are pretty tough, but not quite tough enough, well configured and seem to last forever. These bags make all that easier to do for me.The 100 pack will last me years and this also came with ties as well.
