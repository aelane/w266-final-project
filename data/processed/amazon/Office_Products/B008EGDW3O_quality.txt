Epson quality has went up in the last few years, even with their budget models. I processed it through Photoshop and saved it as high quality file. I printed at the highest quality. Although I like the quality and function I do notice it eats through cartriges pretty darn quickly and they are not cheap. Print quality is good, scans are okay. Print quality: Quality is dependent on the quality and paper you choose to do the job - which is as it should be. Print quality is excellent, though when it comes to photo printing at high quality, it takes QUITE a long time to finish, but the quality is amazing. Print quality seems good, we've got it set on draft mode so as to save ink since this is just mostly for inner-office documents for a guy who's too busy (lazy) to walk out to the main printer to pick up his print jobs. Print quality is fairly good although not a bit less vivid than my Workforce845 printer (also an Epson). Also, printing an 8x10 "best quality" photo takes over five minutes; it feels like an eternity just waiting for the first edge of the paper to come out of the printer.A software disk is included in the package. Medium quality, plain paper.HP via USB:  42 secondsEpson via WiFi:16 secondsI was impressed. The scan quality was fine, and speed was about what I expected since it is not meant to be a high speed scanner. It will print them, but if you want good quality photos, you want a more expensive printer.But for most people, printing a page or making a copy of something, then this printer is great.One thing I find interesting is that the machine tends to "shoot" pages out the front, instead of laying them after printing.
