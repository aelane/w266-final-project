I remember when Post-It notes first came out and we all looked at them and said, "What would I ever use these for? These are made for notes that you want to `stick' around for longer than just the everyday sticky-note. I used to use post-it notes, but those would invariably come off after a short period. It will keep your notes better organized without spending much money on a notebook that includes tabs and separators.It's a good price for something handy.I'm pleased with these tabs. He also uses these to organize his notebooks just like I do.All in all, they are superior to post-it notes because of the tab so you get more of a divider effect. But you can also jot down notes within the label itself. These are not only tabs, but you can write notes on them. Since my notes here pertain to all of these, my reviews of the individual products are largely the same. I use it for taking notes in cookbooks, like when scaling a baking formula.The tabs are transparent enough to allow clear reading of the text underneath (though I'd prefer just a clear one). The post-it notes were problematic since they generally removed themselves from the page they were marking when I grabbed the note to open to that page of my plans. Often, I'd write notes in the margins of the textbooks, referring back to the text itself so that: a) I wouldn't have to copy the quoted text that I was referring to into my notes, and b) it was easy to express my thoughts and ideas right on the page so that when my professor called on me, I could refer immediately to my thoughts without shifting through my papers.The Avery NoteTabs are great because there's only so much space in the page margins and you can use as many overlapping notetabs as necessary. These are perfect for making notes in books without marking the pages or for making corrections to papers and memos. When the notes are read and changes recorded, the tabs can be removed and used for another project.These NoteTabs are great for inter-office memos. I use mine for notes on the refrigerator, marking files and especially as bookmarks. 3) They are see-through, so you can both make notes and still see what writing is underneath.I wouldn't say I see the need to use these often in most environments, but I do think that they meet all their claims. I've tried post-it notes in the past for this purpose in the past and the problem is they are not durable enough for repeated use. I also like to make notes in the margins of my books from time to time, so it might seem that this product would be ideal. It's as if Avery has been watching me, noticing the ordinary sticky notes I attach to book margins in order to mark pages and make notes on. it works well for small notes, reminders etc... however, she did prefer the bigger pocket tabs that could also be used for storing index cards, CDs and more. What makes them better than regular post-it notes?1. They are definitely better than other sticky notes, but they come at quite a premium. These Post-It sized notes with tabs are simply the best I've ever used. The notes not only stick, they also come off easily.I love 'em! However, if notes, editing marks, etc.

I think these notes would be especially useful for cookbooks.

Because this is translucent, any extra notes I write have to be written on the edge overlapping the margins (otherwise my writing will overlap the text so it would be hard to read).I've been using these NoteTabs in textbooks and class notes, but it's really not that different from a regular post-it note.

But they're translucent, so you can make notes that are (if you want) relevant to the text directly beneath the sturdy plastic.
