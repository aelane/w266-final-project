This has to be the best printer I have ever used in my entire life, and that's not hyperbole. What I truly love about this printer, besides the wealth of features it gives, is the fact that it isn't loud enough to wake the dead. This is my third printer from Epson, and I am now pretty well convinced that they manufacture just about the best printers on the market today. This printer works with my netbook running on Windows 7 starter and my laptop running Windows XP. But this is a minor quibble, as the printer functions beautifully. The printer works well on both Windows 7 and Windows XP. Thereafter the printer was visible to the network and installed in Windows 7 and XP using the drivers. I also, as of now, don't know if this printer will continue to allow me to print documents if one of the printer cartridges is low in ink. Because when I switch it out to my el-cheapo printer paper, there is a slight difference. Overall, I find this an excellent printer that is well worth the price.I have a mac, which can occasionally prove a hassle when trying to install new printers, scanners, etc., so I'm pleased to report that it was incredibly easy to set this printer up. As advertised, this printer can print wirelessly and I can use both my laptop and my iPhone. I've been using my printer fairly regularly since I received it and have not yet ran out of ink. It was easy to open the printer up and remove the jammed paper without incident.I think the instrumental panel is top notch with large and responsive touchscreen. However, I believe this is an excellent multi-purpose printer for a very reasonable price. This is now our second Epson printer, along with the 630, and it's as pleasantly easy to set up and use as the first one was.The wireless set up took just a handful of minutes--I literally took more time  to remove all the little tapes from the printer than to set up the wireless connection--and soon I was printing from both my desktop, laptop, and Touch (via AirPrint) with ease. This is one fantastic printer. I had to refer back to the printer's webpage but finding the information once there was challenging and took a longer time than I was happy with. This printer is basically a souped up version of theEpson WorkForce 635 Color Inkjet All-in-One (C11CA69201)that I reviewed a few months ago. This printer is really aimed more at a small business than an individual use.The printer is very easy to setup and connect to your home wifi/router allowing all your computers to easily print from it (note. The printer accepts both). The Epson WorkForce 845 printer is a nice size - not too big sitting on my desk. First of all, I love this printer. You'd buy a bottom-of-the-line printer from one of the major manufacturers, run it for a while, and then say to yourself, "Hey, when I buy ink for this printer it's costing me almost as much as a brand new printer from some other company." My last printer was an all-in-one with wireless ability that I bought for my wife. Epson advises that you can use the printer for this, or for individuals. You can even set the printer so that it will use all the paper from one tray and then automatically switch to the other, so you can print 500 pages at one time.I wondered whether you could switch trays continuously, so that when tray one was empty you could refill it. The printer also now uses the 127 series DURABrite ink cartridges.I. This is a wonderful printer for its price and for those who do a lot of printing or don't want to fuss with having to replace paper often, will enjoy the convenience of the 845. Also, make sure the printer is within range of the router or access point. For those using Mac OS X, it advises making sure the printer driver was installed correctly and that the computer's TCP/IP settings are configured correctly, and to make sure that the printer is connected to the same network as the Mac.This printer is certainly a welcome relief for me and I am very pleased with it. Otherwise, this is a great all-in-one printer for the money. The last printer that I had which held this much paper was HUGE (almost double this size).The touch screen is practical and responsive. I can't tell you enough how much this printer has simplified and expedited my life. I've been using this printer for almost a month now and so far have been very impressed with it. It made the printer I had prior to this feel like an antique. It's a big printer, but not too difficult to move around if you have to. )Overall, I'm very impressed with this printer. This printer looks nice and sleek enough that we were able to stick it in our kitchen and it blends in with the other appliances. During the printer setup, register your name and email address, and then Epson will assign your printer a unique email address, the beginning of which is a long series of gibberish letters that would be hard to guess (so spammers cannot guess it). Very cool and useful.- I often go up to the printer console, stick a bunch of papers in the scanner auto-feed tray, and then select "Scan to PDF." I absolutely love this printer. It has only jamed once and that was because I didn't set the printer to the correct setting I had it on paper with only text and it was a paper that had a picture on it...which did warm me to change the setting but I failed to read it until I tried printing that paper again!I am now trying to print my return address on the large greeting cards and have yet to find how to put it to that setting. This printer is an excellent buy at 149 and I have NO regrets! We use an Epson Workforce PRO printer in the office and thought we would get something similar for the studio behind the house. The printer asks for the password. The printer must look for a standard DCIM folder common to all digital cameras, camera equipped cell phones etc, so hooking up with USB and printing is dead easy.Printing from my cell phone wirelessly I used Epson's iPrint and Google Cloud Print and both worked flawlessly from my phone. This printer is supported by Google directly. I imagine this printer is best for light to medium duty as the cartridges are noticeable smaller than the office printer. Ok, so I have been testing this printer out a lot through out a 6 day period. I use this printer a lot and am really glad that it prints photos out in a timely manner!The copier on the Epson Workforce 845 is yet another positive! It's screen can be moved to face up for added convenience.Turning the printer on and off is a breeze with this printer. It is a great printer that I am sure you will enjoy every time that you use it...I hope this review helped you out! The printer was identified automatically. They can directly print on your printer by emailing it to your printer's email address! Printing while wired was seamless, fast, quieter than I'd expected for such a large printer, and I anticipated the wireless operation to be just as simple. I definitely recommend this printer and suggest that if you're using a Mac, don't be discouraged. The Canon works well (and works VERY well with my Macs) but it has started to print slowly and I've always wanted to get a printer that had a bit more economical print costs (the Canon burns through ink tanks quickly and they are very expensive for the number of pages you get) as well as the ability to print from my growing number of Apple iDevices (it's a bit of a novelty, but there have been times I'm doing something on the iPad and would like to print a receipt or hard copy).I narrowed my search down to this Epson Workforce 845, or one of the HP multi-functions. The 635 was an ok printer, but the setup was quirky and created glitches right from the start that were never resolved. I noticed the Auto Answer Button on the printer's touch screen, activated it and the fax kicked in, as it should.Ink CostsThis is one area where I still have a little concern. Personally though, my favorite everyday printer is still my Kodak, because it only costs $25 for ink. It would seem Epson was aware of that printer's shortcomings, and addressed those improvements in this new model. This is my first Epson printer, I love my Epson scanners (I have several), they are the best scanners I've had and I look forward to using all the features on the Workforce 845.I use several computers (XP, Windows 7 & OS X Lion) and I have several Canon Printer/scanners and a Lexmark printer/scanner. Great little inexpensive printer, scanner, copier. The Epson Workforce 845 is the third printer that I've installed and sampled this year between home and office use. If you use your printer primarily for printing, that's a big plus of course. This is a BIG printer. I have had this printer for a couple of months. The printer shoots out prints really whole lot faster than my Canon Pixma MX 882. The printer scanning feature is truly amazing. I only use my printer over Wi-Fi. This printer has been able to scan my photos and documents over Wi-Fi and send them to my PC with amazing digital quality. I also wanted to mention that this printer is definitely Airprint enabled so if you're an IOS device owner out there with an iPhone, iPod or iPad, you will be able to print directly to your printer over Wi-Fi. The printer should show up when you press print. I highly recommend purchasing this printer. This is the third Epson Workforce printer I've had the pleasure of reviewing in the last three years. The printer's memory card pops up on my Mac network automatically and is noticeably faster than last year's models. The printer only has a power button now, everything else either appears on the large color display or on touch surfaces next to it. The printer's packaging alludes to handheld device printing but never specifically mentioned 'airprint' support. It found the printer and ran the document in full color in just seconds. I would recommend this printer to my family members for sure.Oh, and the print quality is pretty darned good, too. Like any printer, you have to make sure you have the print settings set properly in your page setup on your computer and appropriate paper installed for whatever the job is for it to be successful so keep that in mind. This printer is awesome. My old printer, an HP all-in-one, was trouble from day one, and it seemed that every single day it was either warming up, updating, or failing to work properly. Within the printer settings of your computer you are able to set it up, so automatically prints to the seconds when the first tray is out of paper. The printer does have automatic duplex printing, which help reduce paper waste. I'm coming from a four-year old Canon printer, but I was still amazed at being able to print in my office from my living room. It's easily the most useful printer I've ever owned. I could definitely recommend this printer (or any of its "cousins" in the WorkForce "family" which I've also had a chance to use - specifically, I've tried the WorkForce 840, which is a bit bigger than this one, and the WorkForce 635, which is smaller, with only one tray).SETUP:The printer is very nicely packed, and easy to put together. I didn't even have to hook it up initially to my printer with a USB cable. The printer goes into sleep mode by default and awakens upon receiving a print job. Along with a printer, it is a scanner and a fax. Although it doesn't come with a printer connection cord, it can be set up straight to it directly to a wireless network without one.It does need a firmware update, which is easily downloaded.It is also compatible with the iPad, so you can print from your iPad, other excel and word documents may not print exactly as expected, and Epson suggest that if you have such problems, to convert the files into a PDF document. Hopefully, soon printer manufacturers will improve their technology with 'permanent' cartridges that offer an ability for users to re-fill with ease. While the printer is by no means small, it's lightweight. Even if you're setting up the printer for WiFi use, you are instructed to connect the USB cable between the printer and computer during the software set up. While the printer is definitely not slow, I didn't find it remarkably fast either. The Epson Workforce 845 is not a quiet printer; there is a lot of clicking, rattling noise while it's queuing up a sheet of paper in the feed. This wonderful printer also has a touch-screen control panel that is very simple to use. You can easily get a decent printer for less than the price of the Epson WorkForce 845 that will print in B&W; and color, and connect wirelessly. This my first wireless printer and I love it.I have not gotten wireless before because I was convinced I could not set one up.T
