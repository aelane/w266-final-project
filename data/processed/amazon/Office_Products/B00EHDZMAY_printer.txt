This is an impressive printer. I have yet to learn all the printer options that are available. This printer did not play nice with Windows 8, but this is more of a knock on Windows 8 than MG7120. Just make sure both the printer and iPad are on the same network.At the time of this review, this printer DOES NOT support Samsung Galaxy 4, which is a bit disappointing for me. I was able to get the printer set up and on the network without even getting onto the computer.It is also the biggest 8.5x11 printer I've had. This printer works very well and very easy to get connected wirelessly. This is a very nice printer! This printer has 6 cartridges which was also a first for me - photo black and gray are new, and then it has the standard black, cyan, magenta, yellow. This printer is a real profit center for me.A few days ago, my wife was having issues with her scanner, and asked me to scan a document for her. While the printer driver had installed, the scanner/copier driver had not.I went to the Canon website and downloaded the driver. Here's what I like and don't like about this printer. The new printer software is not nearly as user friendly as the older software. Canon (and the other printer manufacturers) hook you with inexpensive printer prices, and then reel you in with crippling ink costs.There is good news, however. I needed another printer for my pictures which my old printer didnt do. The Canon Pixma MG7120 Wireless Inkjet All-in-One Photo printer is a small printer compared to other home-based consumer level printers. First of all, this printer looks fabulous out of the box, it's a modern sleek design and the output tray pops out automatically when it needs to lending to a streamlined visual design. I got this printer to serve as a photo printer. This printer easily meets that need. We all know printer companies make their money from the ink the printers need so I am a little wary of printing in great quantities, but with the quality of the prints I think I'll come out ahead versus the cost of photo processing. I still feel it's necessary to keep my other printer online for everyday printing (like homework for the kids) so I can keep the ink in this one for photo printing. This is simple a fantastic printer. This printer is wireless, which connects to my home network, allowing me to print from any computer or laptop within the house or even outside on my deck. It's safe to say that with this printer, I'll never pay Walgreen's another dime to print my photos. Over all, I like this printer. 3)The Cannon PIXMA MX922, appears to be the same printer, or close, yet it's only $124 compared to the $164 that this printer costs. If this printer had a fax machine, I could get rid of two other printers/fax machine and just have this one, and my Laser HP. This Canon PIXMA MG7120 is a very nice printer. However, the big printer is awkward at printing small images or color charts. The printer is not too heavy or too large so it fits on top a cabinet. I am very happy with this printer! I found when setting the printer up it stated to wait several minutes before the printer could be detected. It is much quieter than my old printer. I've had the printer for only a coupe months or so but have used it to copy documents, print photos and more. Love the printer. The printer auto-opens when printing so that after you have completed your print job you can shut it before the next use. Overall, this is a very nice printer and scanner. With the printer being so long and wide it would seem like they could make the platen larger as well!I hope this helps you decide on if this is the printer for you! This printer is fantastic.

This is the first printer that works exactly the way it should.

We've never had to connect the printer to the computer via USB, and we've never had to tinker with drivers or settings - everything is on-board through the touch-screen control.

But I've never set up a printer before, so maybe that's just me.Overall, though, I love this printer.
