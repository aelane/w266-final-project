it is a very nice ink. good for ink and printing But I digress and to get back to the ink cartridge it was installed, went through its cycling routine and prints with excellent quality. Love this ink although it only last about 2 weeks with heavy printing but it works good & will re-order in a few weeks from now. I just wish there was more ink in them. Epson T200520 DURABrite Ultra Standard-Capacity Color Multipack Ink is the right ink for our Epson WF-2540 printer. I haven't used these ink cartridges but they are the recommended brand for my printer. I only buy Epson ink now. DON'T buy generic ink for an Epson, or at least, yet. As is common, the ink cartridges will cost far more than the printer. When I ordered Epson ink, I did not expect that it would be sent WITHOUT its proper packaging. I receiving only the ink cartridge in plastic -- no box. The ink is fine, but when I buy a name-brand product instead of a cheap knock-off, it should be sent intact, WITH all proper packaging. Epson ink cartridges are full of great ink, great colors and are easy to handle and install.The only down side is the cost of ink.

I'd change the ink, print til my heart's content & wouldn't have to worry about ink for months.

They really should put more ink in these as its a hassle to change them so often.
