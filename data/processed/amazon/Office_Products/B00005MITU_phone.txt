THIS is the Trimline phone that I remember from past years! This is a very good 2nd phone. Best corded phone on the market -- voice quality, lighted keypad, small footprint. The AT&T; Trimeline is a very basic corded phone that works when the power goes out. This is the classic ATT phone with a nice heavy base and a design that still looks great today. I like this phone so much that I bought a second one in white. Even if this phone craps out after a year, it is so affordable that I consider it a &#34;disposable&#34; item. back up phone that operates without power. When our hard-wired phone recently died after about twenty-five years of service, we replaced it with the AT&T; 210 Corded Phone. When you need a phone during an emergency or power outage, when you want a phone that is reliably located on the "base" where someone hasn't walked away with the handset, this is the IDEAL phone! The phone comes with a longish cord to plug into the phone base and phone jack. The phone comes with pulse and tone dialing (needed to use computerized dialing.) We needed one corded phone for when the power goes out. The phone has a mute feature, adjustable ringer volume and more. I am particularly impressed that a phone in this price range even has a twelve number memory feature for speed dialing. The phone takes up little space and it can even be wall mounted to completely save counter space in a kitchen or any other room. This is a very simple and easy to use phone that works for just about anyplace in the house, where you want to keep your calls stationery. If you really are looking for a extra phone for the home or the office, than I definitely recommend this classic phone from AT&T. This is an ok basic phone, which is what I wanted, in case my electricity goes out. My portable phone finally went haywire so I decided to buy this corded phone since I don't really need a portable and all the static that comes with it. This AT&T phone is a basic design, feels sturdy and works very well with clear sound. If you want a solid, basic phone without bells and whistles, buy this one. This little phone stores neatly in my drawer. Remeber what a phone used to feel like and sound like. This is the old phone as you remember it but its new and fine. So I bought this inexpensive phone as a backup to my cordless phones.

I recently bought this phone for my father who likes his phones simple and easy to use.

Yes, it is corded; but when all you really need is a basic phone this really does the job.The phone has back lit buttons which are desirable for those of us who are elderly or in any way sight impaired.

The phone offers well known features including "last number redial," and allows you to set the phone up with your telephone company so that you can use this phone with features like call waiting and three way calling.
