If you package a lot of boxes this is the route to go. I ship a lot of packages, and I've tried a lot of different packaging tapes. After trying a lot of alternatives, this is now the only kind of packaging tape I use. If you don't do a lot of mailing you may not need the longer roll. I do a lot of packing and wrapping and Scotch tape is an integral part of that process. I send a lot of mail/packages monthly and this was a great deal to get. I send out a lot of packages and am constantly needing packaging tape while putting together those packages. I do a lot of business with Amazon. I ship a lot on ebay and this tape holds it all. We do a lot of shipping, and in the past we used to use (a lot) of masking tape.One strip of this tape does it all - it gives a firm and permanent hold. If you tape up a lot of boxes then it's best to buy in bulk because you get a better deal. There are a lot of reviews stating that the tape does not stick.
