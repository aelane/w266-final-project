Are you still using an answering machine? This machine is superior to our old one is several other ways as well, including being smaller (about 4"x5") and easier to set up and use.Features include automatic day/time stamping of each message, saving messages after playback (you can then manually delete them at your leisure), and using a built-in computer greeting (or record your own). My answering machine is hooked up to phones and a fax machine. I really like this machine. With this machine, you now need to listen to the ENTIRE MESSAGE AGAIN to hear the last 10 seconds. Be realistic.This answering machine was very easy to set up. The machine is also a nice, compact size if you have space considerations.Granted, I have only used this for a few weeks so I can't comment on the durability but out of the box this machine is easy to set up and does what it is supposed to do. We had an AT&T answering machine that was purchased about twelve years ago that I think worked better than this one but it bit the dust. The old machine had four channels so that a person could leave a message for any of four people.

And when you turn it back on, it tells you, "The machine is on.

The machine properly recorded "ET call home" and "This is just a test", but it did not record the "Just a test", "Call James", and "Call me" messages.

I really like this machine because it is a lot more intuitive than the vtech we have on another line.This ease-of-use is due partly a brief written tutorial included with the phone in case you need it, but even nicer is the fact that, as you're setting up the functions, the machine gives you audio instructions as well.
