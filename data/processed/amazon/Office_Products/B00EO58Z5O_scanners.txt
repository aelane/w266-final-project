Used to flatbed scanners, I somehow expected this machine to be a little larger than it is. Some Epson scanners can be used with Image Capture without even installing scanning software. Both scanners scan documents with good quality. It is slightly slower scanning to PDFs than other scanners that I've run, but the real issue is that the OCR on this is behind its competitors, likely because it is using an several year old version of ABBYY Finereader. I have both the Fujitsu and Epson scanners. Quiet, no.We also have two LED flatbed scanners;  one Epson, one Canon. Multi-page scanners are extremely useful, and if you're using one for the first time, you are bound to be impressed.Epson has done a pretty good job of copying the Fujitsu ScanSnap iX500 and the Fujitsu ScanSnap s1500, which seem to be the most direct competition for this device. With many of the other scanners I've used, you have to find and install a separate driver.Physically, although the DS-510 is quite compact, it is still larger than the P-215, ADS-1000W and S1300, but smaller than the ADS 2000. It was the fastest of the three scanners by far.You can scan to most images formats (default is JPEG) and PDF as well as straight to the cloud. I have other Canon scanners and their software is very fast, although not as good at one touch scanning.If one touch scanning is your need or style then this Epson DS-510 is speedy and less expensive than Fujitsu ix500 and faster. Like most scanners, you have to install the software before connecting the unit. Both scanners were well boxed. Both scanners had the USB cable included.Software load on Windows 8.1: On the Epson, the full software installation went flawlessly.
