And, as you'd expect of Sharpie, it's a good, reliable product. I've very happy with the product and recommend it. I highly recommend this product to anyone who uses highlighters. Fantastic product. Another great product from Sharpie! Definitely a nice product for the price. What else is there to say, but "get this product if you need an 8-pack of highlighters! `Just another nice product from a company I've come to trust when it comes to markers and highlighters. Actual product is a lot more bulky. Overall, it's a great product!So long as you don't press down too hard, it doesn't seem to bleed through the pages very much.Now, the picture shown on my computer shows much brighter colors. The actual product I received seemed to have much darker colors, almost marker-like. Great product. I received this product at no cost through the Amazon Vine program.
