I bought this scanner primarily for document scanning, specifically to scan multiple documents into multipage pdf's. I was looking for a sheetfed scanner that would accommodate my OS and Mac platform. This is the second Epson scanner I own. I received the scanner in a lsrge well packed box. The scanner performed as stated and gave me what i was looking for in a flatbed scanner. This is an excellent scanner that has performed very well for me since I've had it. We use this scanner constantly. I've had only one scanner previously, and this Epson has much better resolution, a much easier scan process, and much more functionality in working with the many old photos that we have, and wish to keep.As all the technical specs and features of the scanner are spelled out in the product description, I will just say that I love that multiple page documents can be scanned into a PDF file, perfect for preparing reports (and emailing them is easy). If we knew it was this slow to scan we would have purchased another scanner. This scanner cannot compare to a Neat Receipts product in terms of mobility, but in terms of speed and production this is a winner.Installation was straight-forward and simple, although it took a couple of extra minutes (likely because of the extra software included). I had been using a smaller, portable Neat Receipts scanner to scan all of my financial documents and other items. Overall though, this scanner exceeds my expectations.

I was looking for a scanner to allow me to bring my trustyScanSnap S510M Instant PDF Sheet-Fed Scannerhome from the office.

A scanner offering 20ppm scanning with a 40 document auto-feeder and a name like Workforce seemed to fit the bill.Unfortunately I will be using this scanner at home and keeping my Snapscan at the office.

A scanner may print at 20 pages per minute, but if you have to spend a couple of minutes getting it to start scanning (in spite of the zero warm up time) and a few more minutes post scanning getting it into the correct file, the pages per minute input is misleading.
