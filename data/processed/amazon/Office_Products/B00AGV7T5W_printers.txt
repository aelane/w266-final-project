I've been using printers ever since the first dot-matrix one came out (yeah, I am that old) and have had a ton on printers since. Other printers generally provided an additional tray of some sort, something that never failed to get misplaced and/or lost.The bottom tray is for the paper. Also, all-in-one printers at this price range can print out good photos, but never be able to match the quality from those high-end models.So, what factors to be used for finding a relatively good one from this over-crowded market? Some printers last longer before printer heads get clogged. One of my last printers last only for 3 months, while my previous Canon PIXMA IP-4500 printer lasts for 4+ years while being used on daily basis. Don't be surprised that some all-in-one printers are still one side printing only. It's not bad but it's not as good as I got on other, older, non-photo printers, from both Canon and HP. Never happened before on other printers. Many printers are eyesores, this one is self contained and doesn't look bad on a desk.-Nice scanner works quickly in high quality on wifiCONS-Printing is slow (much slower than Workforce 845). But as Canon printers go, it's a bust. Yes, Canon printers do eat up ink like crazy. For a budget-level printers, this Cannon is excellent. If more printers did this, there would be no question as to whether or not you've inserted them correctly.The wide range of items you can print on with this printer, to me, leaves nothing to be desired for its current offering price here on Amazon. However, when you compare to other printers in this price range (like the Brother MFCJ825), you realize that the Canon isn't that good a deal - other printers in the $90-$125 price range have fax, document feeder, Ethernet, touch screens and more.But my biggest gripe is just how cheap this thing feels - everything is cheap plastic that flexes all over the place.
