Don't get me wrong, these are perfectly good file folders. Smead file folders have been used by me in my working office and home office for as far back as I can remember. The Smead file folders with the reinforced tab are just okay.The pro of the reinforced tab is that it holds up better in the drawer and/or with use.The con is that the reinforcement is created with an extra folded down section along the top of one side of the folder and this "fold-over" effect is not securely held down with adhesive on every file folder. I received my Smead file folders free from the Amazon Vine program, in exchange for writing a review.We have file folders that are decades old, taped and torn, and some that are turned inside out to re-use them. These are well-made, no-nonsense file folders. All file folders should be made like this. These are really excellent, high-quality file folders. These are perfectly adequate file folders, but they are not made of particularly heavy stock, and I don't like the tab design, which is a double layer of paper.I would steer you towards the Smead SuperTab Heavyweight Folders, 14 Point, Letter Size, which I thought were excellent. What does one say about file folders? Excellent, Smead file folders - letter size, 1/3 cut tab, 100 per box: what a great product! When you need to use file folders then the only thing to decide is if they work or they don't work. I've never met a file folder that doesn't work, and I can't imagine not giving 5 stars for something that does exactly what it is designed for. These file folders are just like any other file folder but with an attractive difference -- the tabs are reinforced so that they do not bend or otherwise collapse under use.
