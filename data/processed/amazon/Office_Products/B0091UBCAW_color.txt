This allows you to do color or black and white photo scanning with remarkable accuracy, giving some rare family photos a new life to hand out to other relatives of say a family patriarch etc. My first color printer was in college in 1986 and used a JUKI 5500 four ribbon color and the Epson J80 driver to produce 106 colors. The color is crisp and clear.I worry about how much ink the cartridges will use and about the cost of replacing them. I prefer just having 2 because I don't do much color printing. The color quality is very nice and type crisp. In general, I'm glad to be able to print color but if I want photo quality, I'm having a professional shop do it.Possibly the nicest part about this printer is that it sits in an out-of-the-way corner, behind a lamp, and is barely noticeable until you ask it to do some work. It quickly prompts you to add the color cartridges. We also tested color pictures which printed effortlessly.The document feeder is upright and feeds from the back of the machine. The 4 color boxes snap right in, and if you're like us, you tend to do everything in B&W; to save money.Works fine. The color and the images are sharp. Both color and black and white are sharp and readable. You can't print in color, you can't even scan until you replace the ink.

When color ran low, I could still print in black.

The color printing is great as well.

As far as color printing is concerned, printing the same four color photo pamphlet, print times for each printer were about equal.
