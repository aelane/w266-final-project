The top cover is slightly opaque. The cover is made of a sturdy heavy gauge poly material. I tried this cover with 30 sheets of 8-1/2 X 11 #20 paper and the swing clip slid in without any difficulty. This cover is for reports printed in the landscape format. The see-through cover means whatever paper you put on top can easily be referenced without having to open the cover. The clear cover makes it easy to see what the report is about, but looks professional, too. I like the clear cover that opens to lie flat so you don't have to hold the cover open. This is good because it prevents having to constantly open or fold over the cover just to reference back to the first page. They look professional and they allow you to view the cover page even as they protect it. These are great because I can quickly see thru the cover and know which committee is inside. The transparent cover makes it very versatile and stylish.
