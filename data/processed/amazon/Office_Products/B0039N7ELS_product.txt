So some Search Engine Optimization is needed for this product on 3M's part.I wonder about the greenness - I used to mix flour and boiling water to make glue - is that greener? well-designed product. What a wonderful product for scrapbooking, or placing your pictures into albums.I highly recommend this product for children. I wanted to like this product. It could have been that I had a defective product, but why take a chance in the future?I love that the product itself is bright and colorful. It is re-fillable, easy to open, and it looks like a product that would be great for craft projects galore!When I went to use this, it would give about 50% of the time. This is an excellent product for home or office use. I think this product can replace the glue sticks in many cases. So I would say I like this product because it's easy to use and versatile, a nice gadget to have around the house. This product is similar but instead of laying down a white stripe, it applies a narrow dotted adhesive strip. I love this product. Great product! I really like this product. This is a product that I'll definitely recommend and personally use again as well. Great product! This is a great little product. I would highly recommend this product. I am really pleased with this product, and it will soon become a regular resident of my junk drawer. This product is an adhesive/glue alternative. I liked this product and could see using in for scrapbooking or photo albums. I like the product, but to be honest, I have not used it beyond several test applications that I believe represent "real world" results. A very useful product. Nevertheless, because this product does exactly what it says it will do, and does it well, it merits a full five stars. Excellent product. I won't go on and on, but I'd highly recommend this product. 3M has come up with a handy, easy-to-use, little product! I really like this product. I have to say really loved this product. I found this product very easy to use and will be looking for it next time I am looking to by adhesive on a roller.Update: Since writing this I can say that I am still in love with this product one year later. It is a pretty awesome product for the craft worthy and it's about time something like this was made relatively available! Also worth noting is that the product is refillable so it will be cheaper to use over time. Great product! I didn't expect much from this product so was really happy with the results. I love this little product. I really wanted to like this product. I received this product through the Vine program - THANK YOU AMAZON!After using it for standard purposes like wrapping presents and tacking pictures on the refrigerator... She had suggested a product called Dotto since it was easy to use. Other than that, I really liked the product. I think this product is every bit as good as Dotto's product. This handy-dandy little product has won me over, and I will definitely be buying more. This is very similar to the other 3M product where dispenser released white out tape. Where the Scotch product comes out ahead is in applying the adhesive. Because the Scotch product is a series of dots rather than a continuous sheet, this can't happen. Excellent product, and I will purchase more for certain when this one runs out. So, I'd say the product works well enough, but some minor use difficulties and the cost keep it from becoming a regular purchase for me. Initially, this appears to be a very useful product. Great product!! I've seen this product before from years ago in Japan, and it's a brilliant idea that should've made it here sooner.Essentially, this is like a two-way tape applicator, but it's so much more. This product is definitely worth trying out. They've gone and created yet another ingenious product that saves me a bit of time.I trade books a lot over on [...], and I use labels for tracking the books. I'll keep this product on hand! I LOVE this product. I wouldn't recommend this product for holding up anything heavier than construction paper on something that is displayed vertically. This little product is a joy to use because it is so simple and it works so well. This is a good product for those who like to do paper art projects. Overall, it's a pretty good product and is a good value also. This is such a cool little product. I LOVE this product. I was excited about this product because I was thinking that my children would be able to use it, and it wouldn't be as messy as those glue sticks out there. This is a great product to have on hand for craft projects. This is a great product for card making and scrapbooking and other paper crafting. What a cool product this is!I wasn't quite sure what to expect but this little dispenser just floats across the surface with ease leaving behind rows of nearly invisible tiny adhesive dots. GREAT product! I would definitely buy this product and recommend it for sure! This is a great product for kids because the dispensing is controlled and avoids little fingers trying to manipulate cellophane tape. Is it a very necessary product? This is actually a great product if you don't count the waste it generates. I find this product very effective to affix photos to card stock. This is a neat Scotch product: basically it dispenses tiny little adhesive dots to an area. This is a nifty product. This product revolutionizes simple adhesives in the same way that Post-It Notes did note-taking. I *really* wish I'd had this product when I was in school.Major thumbs up to Scotch for this one. This is a very cool product. I wont replace a product with this, but it's a nice fun addition to a crafter's toolbox. This is a great product for putting adhesive on something in a thin, straight, and consistent manner that doesn't cause bulges or bubbles.I have used this for photos in scrap books, kids' projects, and even professional presentations.It's also easy to refill and the dispenser is made mostly from recycled materials.It's a nifty little tool that helps avoid problems with glue that blasts out of a tube after that hardened bit stuck in the cap is finally gone, and it's better than glue sticks that don't really work that well. This product is no exception. I actually tried wrapping a present with the product. This product is easily a 5-star for me. That's not what this product is -- do you have the white out that comes in this type of roller? If you like scrapbooking, this product will probably be a godsend. This product is very cool, but doesn't seem very useful. The product is named, "Adhesive Dot Roller." Another great new product. Nice product, does an excellent job!! Well this is a product we should of had then!It makes the process of gluing together paper, stamps (unless you use a sticky stamp) that do not stick) or even thin cardboard, much easier to do and it's not messy! Let me start out by saying I love, love, love this product. The Scotch Adhesive Dot Roller is a terrific product. This product put an end to that mess!

When I saw that this product was called a "dot roller" I figured it was the Scotch version of what I'd been using from the craft store to adhere pictures and other items in scrapbooking.

I only used it once and was so impressed I'll never be without this product again.

I didn't even know this product existed or I would have purchased it long ago.
