These folders, which have two-hole metal fasteners at the tops of both sides, are great for organizing papers and for making sure that, once organized, everything stays where it belongs.As far as quality goes, I was very pleased with the strength of the metal fasteners on these folders, but found the overall weight of the folders to be a little bit lighter than I'd expected. I am using the folders in my classroom where they are handled frequently; they are not collecting dust in a file cabinet. The folders are holding up very well with this classroom application so they would work well in the home or office also. I think these folders are well-suited for household use, home office etc. The folders don't cut my fingers when I pull one out - and at my office that makes this a big plus. However, they are heavier than other Smead folders, and given the volume of paper at the office, the extra weight mades a difference. I carry folders with 8-13 of these in each and it adds up. These folders have fasteners on both the front and back flaps, enabling you to make your paperwork stay.Example: I serve on board that distributes a financial statement at its meetings. These folders seem reasonably sturdy and look like they'll hold up. These folders will be easy to see/easy to find--and an easy reminder to stay organized! These folders are fine, they're strong, colorful, etc. However, the folders are very thin and will not stand up to muchheavy use or being overfilled. The folders are made in USA and they have minimum 10% post-consumer recycled content. There are 50 folders in the box. These are great folders, but they're probably best suited for relatively light household use.The box contains four very bright colors of folders, which are 1/3 cut, allowing plenty of room for labels. If you'll be using the folders heavily, this isn't the product for you. These folders are holding up well for me. Normally I buy plain file folders, the fasteners and tape them in to make sure they don't fall out. They would be perfectly fine for folders that are rarely used...though in my experience, people generally want fastening folders like this for HEAVILY used folders, or folders that are moved around a lot, read through while standing at the filing cabinet, etc...and these won't hold up to much use at all. These are excellent folders. This is handy folders for keeping records accessible and in place. There are 50 folders in four colors; red, blue, green and yellow.Aside from using these to organize my paperwork and documents for tax time I am also using these to organize my sheet music. The folders are firm and the fasteners are sturdy. The folders also fit in a hanging folder in my filing cabinet and my portable file storage box. I also like these folders because they have fasteners on both sides of the folderallowing me to further separate my paperwork. I have found these folders incredibly useful -- I tend to have a lot of odd-sized scraps of paper to keep organized, and the fasteners are an enormous improvement in security over plain manila folders. These folders have been so helpful in getting our paperwork at home straight. The folders fit easily into file cabinets and even some home safes. This also makes these folders perfect for business travelers or medical offices. I like that these folders are made for long term duty and can handle an inch of paperwork instead of falling apart after a couple of uses. you've gotta be careful when ordering folders. the folders are solid enough - i'd bought folder before that were so thin that they ripped. these folders are very well made, ready to use, the 1/3rd cut allows me to use lots more tape labels. these folders may be useful for college students working on different projects within different classes. However, I am used to pressboard folders that are fairly industrial and expand to accommodate large amounts of paper. These folders aid in organization but are not very sturdy and would not be recommended for any office where folders are handled with regularity.Here's what I like:1) Different colors - I received four different colored folders - blue, green, red, and yellow. These folders are best for casual office use.These folders are made in the United States.3.5 - 4 stars I've begun organizing - using the yellow folders for different insurances. Will use other yellow folders for different i.e. Very nice folders, with easy to use fasteners on each side. These folders come with fasteners on each side, allowing to securely store your documents, bill, and other stuff for archiving. Overall I'd easily recommend these folders, unless you were looking for temporary cheaper ones. I'm using these folders for something a little different than they may have been meant for. These folders having two fasteners per folder allow to organize a couple of different issues within each folder. These folders are perfect for small to medium size file jobs.
