You can write on the lime-colored tabs, and put a CD or DVD in the jacket part, then stick it on AND reposition it on, your scrap book or school work, presentations and so on!Nice to scan and archive your kids' school work, art, etc. The tabs on the envelopes could be a convenient way to add a note, if required.I love these pockets and have used almost the entire pack since getting them only a few weeks ago. The tabs are sturdy and well made for the task at hand. Additionally the tabs were not changeable. What can I do with these plastic tabs that I couldn't do with other products? The tabs weren't a big benefit to me.The colors I got (blue with lime green tabs) did nothing to inspire me. Being able to label the tabs seemed even better. The tabs make an organizational system possible with CDs. Since this is plastic, it's durable enough for daily use.The tabs are built into the folder and not just glued there; unfortunately the tabs are surfaced with paper so if you write with pen, you can't just erase and reuse. If you don't need the tabs, it's easy to cut them off.The backing has a strip of adhesive, so if you expect to turn pages like a divider, you're going to have to stick this to another piece of paper (no other way for them to attach). The tabs are actually paper laminated to the plastic sleeve, so they are easy to write on. The tabs are described as repositionable, and they truly are, but that also creates a down side to the product. After moving the tabs around an Avery plastic divider I already owned (I love these, by the way) it became less than stable on the page and lost its stickiness rather quickly. So if you want these tabs to be staggered in a notebook, you need to place them at different areas on a page so the side tabs don't overlap in a binder. While Avery advertises using these tabs for business cards, I do not think these pockets are very useful for items like that.
