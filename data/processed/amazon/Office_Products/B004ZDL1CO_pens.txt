It is similar to Parker's QuinkFlow, Schmidt's EasyFlow, Monteverde's SoftRoll, and some Japanese pens of brands I cannot recall at the moment. I would recommend these pens, and I like the white color as I can spot them among other pens in my purse. These pens work very well. I really like these pens, the ink flows very easily and they just have a good grip feel to them. The  Ink Joy pens are "walk away" pens. These are great pens. These pens write pretty well once you get them going, but it takes too long for that to happen - to get them started you have to do that thing where you scratch out some scribbles on the page, and it takes several seconds of doing that before they start writing. First off, these pens have a nice feel to them, they don't feel weightless and cheap.The grip is nice, cushioned and more substantial and comfortable than normal cheap pens which I can't write with for very long.The ink flows flows nicely and is a nice color. They don't smear as easily as many other pens. First off I love that these pens do not require caps, as I always tend to loose them! I love these pens. I'll stick with my roller-ball pens for now.Give this product a miss. So far the pens start instantly and do not need to be stroked on paper to get them started. After using these, I think that I prefer Sakura Gelly Roll pens, but they also have a tendency to smudge.Wax:The pens come with WAX BALLS on the pen tips to prevent the pens from drying out in the store. These pens feel good in your hand because of the rubber, but they don't always work as good as other pens I have used. It's mainly because I store my pens in a little coffee mug where they all hang out on my desk. Yes, these pens are heavy on the ink. I might not use these pens to write letters on thin paper, but if I wish to leave a bold note or label, they are the (nicely styled) go-to pens.Because they come in an assortment of colors, they are perfect for sorting, labeling, leaving a bold note.I wouldn't figure on writing a grocery list or composing a letter as the ink is heavy.So, I think these pens are excellent in the right hands. I love these pens. These pens look really classy. Overall these are decent pens. I have been using the black and blue pens, and my girlfriend was using the red one. Pentel and Pilot pens seem to have much better mechanisms, ink flow, and aesthetics than these, but then again they tend to cost more as well. These pens come with a little ball of wax covering the tip to protect it from drying around. I've opened three of the four pens so far, and I haven't had any of the blotting issues that others have run into. These pens are the smoothest I've ever used. This should replace those classic black and metal pens that float around the military and other government offices. I hate using pens that smudge unless time is given for the ink to dry. The Paper Mate Inkjoy pens are decent every day ballpoint pens, I like the easy flowing ink making for a smooth gliding pen. These pens have a comfortable tapered grip that I like, they are easy to hold yet thin enough in the center to stay put in your hand. Red is obviously different, but the black and blue pens are hard to tell apart until one writes with them.Because another reviewer mentioned blotting of ink, and I have certainly experienced that with other Paper Mate pens, I'm somewhat nervous about putting them in my pocket, since plastic pocket protectors are so passe, but I have not, myself experienced this with these pens. I really liked these pens--but the blobs of ink are a problem. As to writing, these pens right smoothly and well. For fancier pens, I would recommend Paper Mate flair, the new Sharpie pen, or the classic Pentel R.S.V.P. I really enjoy using Paper Mate InkJoy pens. I really like these pens. These pens are not wide enough in diameter to be heavy, but are not to thin. I like retractable pens as well because I tend to lose caps. The pens are color coated, but not flashy, on the base of the retractable lever end.A nice pen. This pen looks really great (and I haven't seen too many pens that are white). It should be noted that I've only finished using one of these pens and I'm on my second pen, so my review may or may not change by the time I'm on the fourth pen.There's really not much to say about this product, since I'm not a pen or writing enthusiast. These are nearly 5-star pens. Two of these pens quickly became my favorite go to pens! In the past, I've been frustrated with pens that dry out between days but these pens don't have that problem at all.Overall, these are great. They definitely have known how they make their pens so well. These pens worked great. These pens are very easy to use and comfortable to grip. Overall, they are nice pens. I know I stopped using the pens with caps a long time ago. The pens are light, comfortable to hold, and write very smoothly. Paper Mate pretty much advertises these pens as their top-of-the-line product, and they didn't disappoint. I WANTED to like these pens...but I didn't.PROS:- Writes with little effort- Bold inkCONS:- CLUMPS of ink like crazy! I think these are just old pens dressed up in new fancy jackets. They are pretty good pens. I love these pens! Okay, I know that sounds bad but I absolutely love pens. That's why I was very anxious to give these pens a shot. These Inkjoy pens look stylish and write very smoothly. I use these pens at work (I am a nurse), & there is nothing particularly special about them. I would definitely buy more of these pens. I collect pens and like every writer that puts pen to paper I have my favorite brands and types of pens that I like to use. These pens have been great to write with at class, home and work. These pens look excellent, very sleek design with a white handle and gray rubber tip. I have always loved pens. These pens are good for taking quick notes and writing pretty letters to send to friends alike. The pens guide nicely on paper and pass the test of writing at an angle or upside down (don't know when I will need to write this way, but it's a good test). They are fine pens and I'm using them, they just aren't anything special.

The pens come packaged with two black, one blue, and one red and I don't think most people need a red pen.Overall, this is a nice, basic pen and the price seems reasonable.

Okay, we're using less pens than ever, but sometimes a good pen is a necessity.

These are inexpensive, lightweight pens that write smoothly and are easy to carry with you.
