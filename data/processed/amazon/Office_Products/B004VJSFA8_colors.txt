I only hope that Avery will add more colors to their recycled product in the future. The colors I got are pastel tones. They colors aren't to wild or datk (yes, I've had them too dark). The colors are soft enough that they don't hide your ink and make it difficult to ready. These Avery Sticky Notes come in three bright colors, and are made from 100% recycled paper, which makes them an even better choice. I also like the colors that they come in (I got blue, green and pink). Adhesive is good, colors are nice and they are standard size. I do find the colors a bit bland.

Also in my favorite colors; I prefer this mid-range blue, pink, and green to very bright colors.

The colors are good, not too mild and not too bright.

Not the most manly of colors, but I'm pretty sure no one is being judged by their choice of sticky note these days.
