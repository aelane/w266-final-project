Pull up the pre-cut tape pack with your free hand and stick the wrapping in place. The tape pads are easy to load, open the sliding flap and drop it in, close and pull the tape out. The tape dispenser and pre-cut strips of tape make it simple to hold paper and get tape ready without having to cut tape or tear it across a dispenser's metal teeth. That would depend on how often you would like to have pre-measured tape easily accessible. Convenient tape dispenser, it is a handband, now who would have thought of that? You don't have to worry about cutting off the tape, because it is already pre-cut. Luckily the tape strip packets are the same, so I can use leftovers from the previous dispenser in this new one.Only caveat is that the pre-cut strips are only an inch long, so this product is mainly only for gift wrapping (or hanging things up, etc.). When using this tape dispenser, it speeds up the CHORE of wrapping and eliminates the horrible tendency of the tape sticking to itself on the roll. The tape is just the right size when wrapping gifts.I did have quite a bit of a problem opening the dispenser (it's suppose to easily slide down - mine didn't - I found it difficult to open). Never lose your tape again! Why improve the tape roll with something lame? Also, a little larger tape packet would make it worth the money. No more fighting with tape rolls to find the missing end, etc. This tape dispenser is great for making gift-wrapping easier. Away you go.The tape is thick, durable, and invisible. So it seems that the tape will not pop off easily. I found the tape refill door to be very difficult to open the first couple times. I love this tape dispenser when it comes to wrapping presents. If you want to make the tape pieces last longer, you could easily cut them in half (they're pretty big), but then the dispenser loses some of its simplicity :).Ingenious product. Yes, it runs out of tape pretty quickly, so get plenty of refills. This pop-up tape dispenser is a life saver when it comes to bulk present wrapping. It does what it is designed to do, the tape is a good length and texture. I never had to worry about "where's the tape!" Regular tape dispenser refills are 3 bucks and go a LOT farther. I guess this would be better than dealing with the disposable tape dispensers which require two-handed use. The tape is pre-cut in lengths of 2 inches. This tape dispenser is "The Bomb". * The tape used in the dispenser is thicker than standard roll tape. Who would have thought a tape dispenser would be this easy, fun, AND useful?Slide the door open, insert tape, slide the door back, and ta-da, you are ready to go. The pop-up tape works great and I don't find myself fighting with a tape dispenser or losing the end of the tape onto the roll. But, not enough for it to affect how much handier this is than the typical tape dispenser. With tape, the entire strip is adhesive, and much more adhesive than post-it glue. This pop up tape dispenser is a life saver. I got one of these tape dispensers just before Christmas, that dispenses pre-cut pieces of tape:Scotch PopUp Tape Handband Dispenser, 0.75 x 2 Inches, 75 Strips per Pad, 1 Pad per Pack (Colors May Vary) (96-G)Yes, the pre-cut pieces of tape were of a use-able and good length, and they came out of the dispenser just fine, and it was kind of fun. This tape is good quality, but I can't really see abandoning my usual gift wrap tape and its standard tape dispenser for this product. I also like to cut my tape at whatever length makes sense for what I am doing versus having predtermined lengths of tape.I'll keep the PopUp Tape Handband dispenser around, but I will likely continue to use the tape from a familiar roll dispenser. This tape is convenient for gift wrapping. You never have to look for the tape, because it is right there on the back of your hand. I was really looking forward to trying this tape, but it just didn't work very well for me. I used the tape anyway, and I have to say it is nice to be able to use both hands when taping something. Still, I think I will just keep using regular tape. I've used Scotch tape dispensers years ago, and this is a much-improved design from those dinosaurs!The dispenser opens with a slide to hold the tape, then a nice sturdy elastic band fits around your fingers, knuckles, or wrist (depending on your preference and size). The tape is right there when you get the gift wrap into position, and a perfect strip is easily dispensed with a pull. The tape is very sticky. "Where's the tape!" You can pull the pre-cut tape strips as needed, and this is quicker and easier than grabbing them from some surface to which you have temporarily attached them. There's no looking for the ^#*$#*!&@ tape dispenser also, it's right there on your hand, and although others have complained, I had no problem with the fit. The tape broke once (apparently I didn't pull fast enough) and it lay stuck horizontally over the surface of the container exterior. Because the tape is raised over these bumps (rather than being taped completely flush with the dispenser), it's easier to remove it. I wish they would have included more than one tape cartridge in this package.My main complaint is about the actual tape cartridges, which only include 75 strips per pad. The Scotch PopUp tape dispense is a great idea - instead of an endless roll of tape that you have to measure and use two hands to control, you strap this device to one hand and use the other to pull out pre-measured lengths of tape. I received my popup tape handband dispenser after the winter wrapping insanity had ended, but still find that it's very helpful for quick jobs requiring average length tape strips.The 3/4" width and 2" length of these strips is a good, general size for just about any of your average tasks, and I also like the fact that the tape itself seems to be just a bit thicker (or at least sturdier), than the average roll tape. However, popup tape is easier than tape that comes in the disposable plastic dispenser. The pre-measured tape doesn't make a difference. The Scotch Popup tape strips with handband dispenser is a very handy tool. I can wear the tape dispenser forward of my knuckles around three of my fingers. I understand that the conventional tape dispensers often have tape which gets stuck to itself on the role and sometimes that can be a problem. I ran out of tape much faster, in my opinion anyway, than traditional tape. Putting the tape strips inside was easy.I mainly wanted to try this because when wrapping gifts I always have a problem making the ends of the paper neat and smooth. The tape comes out at a predetermined size which seemed perfect for most of my projects. The tape is sticky and easy to hold. I would like to have the tape pulled and the stickiness to be on the same side each time. So while handy, I feel that this nifty tape dispenser should not be considered a total replacement for the good old roll of Scotch tape, with the built-in cutter. The tape strips are easy to install and use. It is less tape than a regular package and costs more money. So what you do is you put down whatever you need to tape up, pick up the tape dispenser, tear off a piece of tape (which sometimes doesn't tear right, sometimes comes out too short, sometimes too long), go back to the item you need to tape, and then tape it.With this thing, you hold your item with one hand (the hand with the dispenser on it), get the tape with the other hand, and tape it together! The tape strips load in easily, come out easily, and are the perfect size for wrapping gifts. I liked this little Scotch tape dispenser: I think it's useful for wrapping a bunch of gifts, especially Christmas presents around this time of year! Third, the tape is more than twice as expensive as getting it on a roll.Amazon prices change regularly, but at the time I write this, a 12-pack of pop-up tape strips (75 strips, 2 inches each, times 12) is eight dollars. It's so easy to pull out just enough tape while keeping hold of the package. Wow, you can wear tape on her wrist instead of the incredible burden of tearing tape from an old-school tape dispenser. It is not an everyday tape dispenser for those time when you perhaps need one piece of tape. I think the tape per inch cost is certainly higher, but that's why I'll be saving it for special occasions. This tape dispenser makes it much easier to wrap a gift. And the pre-cut tape (.75" X 2") makes wrapping fast. I've been using these little pop-up tape dispensers for years. The tape comes out in strips ready to use! Once filled with the pre-cut tape strips (can be tricky) you slide it over one hand or wrist and you're ready to tape.I like that the pieces pull out easily and that the user has two hands available at all times to hold paper or packages in place. Mind you, it's more expensive than those plain old tape dispensers, but convenience is always worth something. The tape now stays securely inside the dispenser, rather than randomly popping out like it did before. Tired of that infernal, difficult to use Scotch tape? I am always hunting for my tape, and with this, it is right there. This little tape dispenser has a handy strap that allows you to wear it. You will never lose your tape again while wrapping. MUCH easier and less fumbling for tape. I have wasted so much tape in my life trying to tear it off with whatever fingers were not holding the paper. When the tape twists, and it always does using just a couple of fingers, it's garbage, and you realize that about a fourth of your tape ends up in the trash. I don't have to pull twisted tape any more that ends up in the garbage can! The pop-up tape is easy to load. No more twisted tape or struggling with holding the paper to be taped! While it certainly isn't hard to cut tape, it is inconvenient to have to drag your bulky dispenser with you, try to hold it down and tear tape while holding package paper steady. This nifty little tape dispenser design from Scotch 3M attaches to your wrist to make wrapping packages a breeze. The pre-cut tape strips are the perfect size for most packages and free you from having to tear the tape off of a dispenser. The tape works well, and the dispenser is convenient and actually stays adjusted on the hand better than I expected. I can tear off tape with the best of them and this product didn't necessarily save me that much time. I mean, cutting tape isn't really that hard is it? Now I'll always know where to find my tape. I have never found a regular tape dispenser to be overly difficult to use so I fail to understand why paying 5 times as much to have a tape dispenser with pre-cut tape attached to my wrist is very beneficial.
