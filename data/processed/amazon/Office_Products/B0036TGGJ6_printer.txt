The one the printer was connected to could not be turned off. This printer is not like that! I normally get a printer and one set of replacement ink, and what the last of the ink is gone, these become target practice and end up in the land fill. It is also important to know that you need a standard printer stye USB cable and NOT the mini-usb - here is a good deal on a cable that will workMediabridge USB Cable - A-Male to B-Male - 6ft. If you are looking for a printer for your laptop or if you are looking for high quality prints you may want to upgrade to a more expensive option.3 Stars You know, I'm just using this printer as a home printer, minimal usage except for the occasional homework assignment and fax. The printer was up and running 10 minutes after I got it out of the box. This is a very interesting little printer from setup to printing quality. Then this printer takes the next step and also does a high quality scan of pictures which was a lot more than I expected from this printer. This printer is 11"D,17"W, by 8.5"H, much smaller than the OfficeJet 7500 12"D, 20"W, by 13"H but it purports to do the same things. This printer had all of the good qualities of an HP printer in a very small package. I love this printer! I looked high and low for any printer that does this. I will be purchasing a 2nd as a spare.This printer does print a little slow so if you are writing your memoirs then maybe a quicker printer is for you. This printer is fine for me.If loading software disk that comes with printer you may wish to choose the Minimum option. The HP Officejet 4500 is a printer that ranks as a basic All-in-One in my book. As for unpacking the printer itself, it isn't hard to un-box and all the tape and pieces of cardboard you need to pull out are in easy reach with no surprises lurking.Setting the machine up initially isn't hard either. Lexmark printer's I owned would install in maybe 2-3 minutes. This is a great printer,  it is much faster than my previous printer and has more options when printing a page. As for the printer interface, simple and efficient with the use of just 3 buttons to move around menus and very readable text. The printer is essentially a "BASIC" 4-in-1 here... there is NO WIRELESS, NO MEMORY CARD SLOT, NO Two-Sided Printing etc. With all that said I would recommend this printer to someone who does not dabble with photo printing/photography and does not need a networked printer. It is not included with the printer. If you need a printer cable here is a cheap yet quality solutionMediabridge - Hi-Speed USB 2.0 Cable (6 Feet) Basically you plug in the printer and insert an auto-load cd to your computer and the rest is magic. It would not replace my beloved Canon printer, but I did find it to be a competent and compact solution for home office/personal use. I found this printer combo very easy to set up and easy to use. It is indubitably and undoubtedly the very worst printer that I have ever purchased. What IS it with printer manufacturers and their software? Very nifty!Overall: A good printer.
