I far prefer it to our old dispenser and if I were moving or doing something that required a lot of taping, would definitely get this one. This Scotch dispenser is much easier to use, though like other reviewers, would appreciate some basic directions. It's a great dispenser and fits the standard:Scotch Heavy Duty Shipping Packaging Tape, 1.88 Inches x 54.6 Yards, 6-Rolls (3850-6).Highly recommend! This dispenser is wide, durable and strong. I would highly recommend this dispenser. The dispenser doesn't come with a roll of tape; if it came with a roll or two, I wouldn't mind shelling out $25. However, as a dispenser alone, I feel like it should be more in the $10-$15 mark. It is so much easier with this Scotch Box Sealing Tape Dispenser.The dispenser works well and is easy to use. The dispenser has a brake so the tape stops dispensing and you can get a good tight fit on your package. I will continue to use this over my old dispenser. *Be careful when grabbing the dispenser; the cutting blade is exposed and very sharp!Overall:This Scotch H-122 dispenser is simple and works well for most higher capacity, more extensive packaging tape dispensing tasks. It doesn't look like the other dispenser in that it's not as "rugged," but it's user-friendly in that it's easier to use and store. I love this dispenser because it's so solid, heavy-duty with a dependable feel in the hand without being unwieldy or complicated. Buy the real-man dispenser and some large rolls of tape and you won't be sorry. This dispenser is much stronger being made of a much more heavyweight (but not heavy) plastic. The dispenser is very compact and lightweight. Well, I've had that other dispenser for years. Then again, I like my original dispenser more. This dispenser is basically a tape holder with a cutting edge attached to it. I have a flimsy old red dispenser which I've used for years, the kind that flexes open to slip over the tape spool and then the two halves slot together inside the spool to hold it on. However, in the old dispenser, the tape would make this horrible loud crackling / zipping / ripping noise as I unrolled it, and it had a tendency to roll off in sudden spurts so I would pull and then suddenly have unrolled more tape than I wanted. Tape dispenser aided in rounding corners by applying the built-in brake for a tighter pull giving way to a smoother, more secure, seal,  without ending up with bunched up or puckering tape.The serrated blade is very sharp and consistently cut the tape without a problem. Picked up dispenser, checked it out -- no cracks, no broken pieces, no loose parts -- tape pulled and cut as usual. The dispenser itself has wide prongs below the brake that capture the cut end of the tape really well. Priced at just under $27, this dispenser is an investment, but it's worth it if you have a lot of cartons to seal. I like this dispenser and will use it regularly. I can't see that happening with this dispenser. This dispenser also doesn't have a "wiper" the pistol style dispensers do, so you have to do that separately after closing.
