The markers don't smudge, BUT the black ink on the sides does, like crazy! These markers are a great quality, they are small highlighters so good for tight spaces and very pigmented. (They work great as markers, though!) No more dried out markers, and no more looking for missing caps.- Nice wide variety of colors, though I wouldn't recommend the dark blue or the purple as a highlighter (too dark to see text easily).- No smearing!The only negative I saw was that the tip is on the thinner side. They're better as markers than highlighters perhaps.I tried out the claims as far as smearing. There  are markers out there that I have used to hi-lite with only to have the page ruined because of bleeding and smearing. I am very pleased with these markers and WILL be buying and using Sharpie retractable pens. I used the dark markers to make a "welcome back students" poster for my sister in law's classroom and they are colorful enough to fill in as art markers, but I cannot use them as highlighters--especially the blue and purple.

These are highlighting markers - which I figured would be yet another useful Sharpie product - I was right!They're retractable....awesome.

I like writing with the markers using the sharp end--a fine point, indeed--especially in cursive--it makes my handwriting look good!

These markers will highlight small to normal text, but they do not make the wide marks of fatter highlighters.
