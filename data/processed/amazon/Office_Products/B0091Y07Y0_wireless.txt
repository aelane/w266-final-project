I love the wireless technology of this XP600 and the print quality is excellent. Once you set up the wireless connection AirPrint is instantly available on your iDevice. You can print wireless from your tablet or smartphone, whether it is by apple or android. I've set the wireless up to  my laptop and it has worked perfectly. This means you need to "type in" your wireless network key on the printer display, using a multi-page alphabet/number/symbols set and directional keys to highlight each character of your key, then press OK, then go on to the next. I realize they're many other wireless printers offered for less money, but I would advise the XP 600 because of the reliability. Excellent wireless connectivity, and high print quality make this a viable choice, but it's not exactly for the high volume user. The wireless works fantastic, and it's quick on the draw, so to speak!Overall, a solid 4-star printer. It hooked up flawlessly to my wireless network and is a miser on ink. Epson Expression XP-600 Wireless Small-in-One Color Inkjet Printer is a very fast wireless printer that will let you print with good quality, scan, copy, fax and also print directly from mobile devices with its Wi-Fi connection.Features that I like:1. The wireless is super easy, unless you have MAC filtering turned on within your network, then you need to input the MAC address to allow it on your network. The wireless network setup process correctly figured out the IP addresses for the default gateway and for assigning to the printer itself.The printer comes with a USB port and a memory card reader, so you can print out the contents of a plugged in flash drive or a memory card directly, without having to transfer those files first to your computer.For functionalities that need to be tested with a computer (e.g., wireless printing, scanning documents into a computer, etc), I used computers that had a Windows operating system.Printing, copying, and scanning speeds were pretty average for this category of inkjet printers.
