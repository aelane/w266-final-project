When you insert  a pencil it goes into the little plastic sharpener, which then starts to rotate. Portable pencil sharpeners have come a long way since I had carried one around in my Art Bin in college. Portable pencil sharpeners have never been known for their power, until now.This one takes four AA batteries. I really like this pencil sharpener. Sometimes I have to wiggle the pencil a little to get it to go in completely straight, but it's not a problem. This is a battery-powered pencil sharpener that's very easy to use. This pencil sharpener works well. We have been looking for a pencil sharpener that works for ages. We just choose not to spend $40-$50 on a pencil sharpener for Pete's sake.This sharpener is great! This works well on any pencil regular and color pencil that seem softer but is quiet and is made very well I was expecting it to be more like the pencil sharpeners that were mounted to the wall in school classrooms - the kind with two roller cutters - that would blast through a pencil. Until then, this is an okay pencil sharper, although there are better options out there. I got this electric pencil sharpener through the Amazon vine program to review. It is a decent pencil sharpener, although it does take two hands to operate.The pencil sharpener requires 4 - AA batteries to run. This is a wonderful pencil sharpener that is fantastic on my desk but small enough to take while out & about.There are many times I like to take my drawing satchel with my many colored and regular pencils out for the afternoon and the X-Acto SharpX Portable Sharpener fits perfectly in my bag and has the power to tend to my various pencils perfectly.I Like having the sharpening power without needing some huge beast that I need to plug in.Works Great at a wonderful Price It sometimes grabs the pencil in some off-kilter way, leading to a spike of wood with a very sharp sliver of graphite halfway down. That said, I really love this pencil sharpener. It's fast and efficient, and it produces the really sharp, long-lasting pencil points that I prefer. Some just continuously break the pencil tip no matter how carefully you try to sharpen them. I've had this pencil sharpener for about 2 weeks now. We're back to our old scholastic pencil sharpener that probably cost 50 cents.=====OLD REVIEW=======Pros: Sharpens a pencil BEAUTIFULLY! I've been using a small hand-held pencil sharpener for a while now. With it, the pencil seemed to disappear before my eyes before it got sharp enough.I decided it was time to try another sharpener and got this X-ACTO SharpX model. I bought this because I take colored pencil art lessons and you need a pencil sharpener at all times when you use these pencils, because the tip has to be sharp.
