So far I am really happy with this scanner. The scanner just slices off the film strip at a fixed interval that doesn't happen to jibe with my photos. I set up the scanner, ran the install software, turned it on and got the drivers from the disk. Fortunately I have another scanner for documents, and it works instantaneously.It's possible that some of the items above are user error on my part, but with the meager documentation and web site, it's hard to develop a detailed understanding of the unit without a lot of experimentation, which might cause one to miss something. I've owned this scanner since 2007 and in the 5+ years, it has remained an excellent resource for my photographic work. I am very happy with this scanner for the purposes I use it. It is certainly above the typical scanner, as it should be. The scanner is well-built and I feel comfortable that I will own it for a long time without many problems. But you can always use the scanner with other imaging software as well.Overall, I'd recommend this scanner to most people, especially a professional or to those wanting to scan a large quantity of photographs. I have had this scanner now for over a year and it has served me very well. I was using the scanner on an iMac at the time of the failure and on impulse before sending it back I hooked it up to my MacBook Pro which I had used for some initial testing with it so the software was installed already. This is an incredible scanner and seems built very, very well. I own a Epson high-end scanner 2 models back.

I bought this scanner a month ago to scan the several thousand slides I have taken over the past years.

After receiving the scanner (which set up easily) I did an extensive set of tests to determine the appropriate settings (resolution, compression, etc), and then set about scanning my slides.Now that I am 2/3 done with the task I can say that it's working OK, but there are goods and bads.

This is not a general-purpose scanner, i.e.
