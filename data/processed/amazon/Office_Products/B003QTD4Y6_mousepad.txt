Not much to say about this mousepad - it's a better quality than most free mouse pads you get that have horrible advertising on them. Overall, it's a nice mousepad, but nothing to get too excited about. I still prefer a mousepad with a wrist rest but if you're looking for an inexpensive mouse pad this is a great choice. Gross.I had a mousepad with a wrist-wrest on it, but it was in the way: The pad was next to my laptop and the CD drive can't open with that stupid thing in the way. This mousepad is no different. This is a sleek mousepad that allows you to use a mouse (laser or ball) quietly and effectively. LOL.It's a mousepad, plain and simple. )Basically, this is a solid mousepad and it has a happy little Amazon logo to boot.What I really like is the packaging. I had previously been using a freebie Corel mousepad & it slipped around on my desk, but this one stays put!

Good mousepad, I am using it with with a Razer Deathadder for multiplayer FPS and it works good.

So I'll do a mousepad limerick.There once was a lovely black mousepad,It was flat and lovely and not at all bad.My mouse moved and tracked just fine,Across every click and word and line.And using it did not make me at all mad!There you go.
