I like the colors better with the Avery, they are slightly more vibrant. If they were both priced the same, I'd go with Avery, because the colors are better. The colors do not impede readability even when using penicls. The colors included in the pack of 200 were a deep mint green, a bright pink, aqua blue and lavender--50 of each. Multiple colors help me find things quickly. Love the colors and found them as good or better than that other name brand!As an author and reviewer, I use sticky notes a lot - to make notes, tag a place in a book I want to refer back to, etc. Next, the colors are varied, pastel blue, pink, green, etc., but not overly girly. Nice bright colors will sure to be noticed... and...  oh... that word in the title... The colors are nice, they accept ink easy (both liquid and roller ball) and best of all, the stick where you put them! The colors I got are pastel tones. I really like the colors on these; they are enough different than the ones I have been using for years, that I like them better. The colors are great for using when coding different things, like who the note is for. The colors are pretty but the functionality is not all that different from 3M's sticky notes. I like the colors as well. The colors are fun, and each color is part of its own little 50 piece pad. The colors are not to dark that you can't see the writing (I hate that...Why bother writing a note if I can't see it)They are a pastel type color that is not too feminine.The glue is strong enough to hold on. Avery now offers all the colors and styles you could want in a sticky note.My latest innovative use of sticky notes: marking the desired fill line on my coffee machine's reservoir, because the actual markings are hard to see. Great colors! The colors are very pleasant and are noticeable, yet not too bright and obnoxious. Very attractive colors. The colors are nice. The colors are great. Nice colors, nice size, they work well and the stickiness lasts for a long time... Good colors, nice stickiness, and boxtops for education (if your kid's school collects them). The colors stand out just enough from one another that I can color code different parts of the projects. Even the colors are similar. The colors are nice. there are also other colors available - enough that my boss uses these to color code paperwork to various projects.I would note that the sticky patch is the same size and stickiness as the regular 3M Post-Its, and I've come to prefer the "Super Sticky" sticky  notes. The colors are also good, bright enough to be seen, yet soft enough to read black or blue ink notes.T
