While not laser quality, the results are satisfactory for business use. Otherwise, the quality is good and the printer is relatively fast and not inordinately noisy.Unfortunately this printer is a bit of a glutton when it comes to ink consumption. Don't expect super high quality photo prints (although the quality is great nevertheless with water based ink), and you can't possibly go wrong with the WF-7610, a workhorse printer built to last. )As far as print quality goes - it's better than my color laser, and given that it can accept glossy paper and, in general, various types of paper, it surpasses it in terms of flexibility as well. I'm impressed by the nice quality of photos printed on plain paper; nice colors with accurate saturation and a lack of smearing.The integrated software is clunky. The quality is decent but not comparable to color laser, which is referenced in the marketing and sticker on the body. The quality is very good, clear and sharp and the ink resists smudging. It is easy to set up, has quality print, is quick, has fairly inexpensive cartridges, prints large format, and prints absolutely beautiful pictures.The only drawback at all is the size and weight of the beast. They always make quality prints. It prints high quality business documents, exceptional color prints, and is easy to use. The quality that prints is great! I would recommend using premium quality photo paper via the rear document feeder for best results. Copy quality is above average with good color reproduction. Scan quality is above average for black and white text at the default setting. Stop heading out to print high quality photographs, you have the ability to do so right from your own home.
