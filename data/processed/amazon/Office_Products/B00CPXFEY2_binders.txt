What I dislike about most binders is that after some wear and tear, the rings become offset and thus do not close properly. I keep my binders on a shelf, so I appreciate the side sleeve especially. These binders also come with a one gear guarantee. These are perfect sized binders for storing an assortment of papers I use for my research. I'm always searching for binders for home and office needs. And I use the binders a lot.This one stands up to daily use and even misuse. These binders endure frequent handling better than other brands I've used because of their knitted, reinforced spines. I usually use white or black binders and find the purple of theWilson Jones Heavy Duty Round Ring View Binder with Extra Durable Hinge, 1-Inch, Purple (W363-14-267)to be attractive, impressive and be easier to notice. These binders come in a wide array of colors, I'll undoubtedly be ordering quite a few more for my sheet music project. Also, I have bought binders for half the cost with even thicker covers and more durability. I've bought better binders, but I've bought worse, too. The binders I have have been using have the ring bracket in the narrow center segment. I use binders for my professional materials, lesson plans, guided reading groups and for a ton of other reasons. The binders at my office take to much of a beating and I don't think this &#34;heavy duty&#34; binder can handle it.At first appearance, the binder looks well made, sturdy. I find I can remember what is in what in my  binders by remembering the color of them. I like to use binders like this to store recipes I have printed out and placed in plastic sleeves. Time will tell but I'd be surprised if these lasted any longer than some of those other comparable binders out there.
