That means that the paper comes from a sustained forestry initiative (sfiprogram.org for more details).These notebooks are a good assorted package for covering multiple subjects with single-subject notebooks. The paper itself is not bright white, it has a gray cast to it. The paper is sturdy and the pages can be ripped out easily without tearing into the paper.No complaints here! The paper is typical, rather thin notebook paper. The paper is smooth, so you can write quickly and clearly. Love how nice and heavy the paper is. The paper is medium stock and the notebook itself is sturdy enough for on semester's work. This paper is easy to write on and silky. The paper is mediocre and thin, so you must be careful what kind of ink you use to prevent bleeding. The paper is a bit thin but will hold up for reasonable use. The paper is thick enough for ink not to bleed through. The paper quality for the Mead Spiral notebooks is good, however, the only problem I have with these (and other Mead) spiral notebooks is that for the price, I wish that the perforated pages wouldn't tear out so easily. The paper on the older ones, as well as the new ones, is smooth and easy to write on. The paper is easy to write on, the colors are fun, and overall, they work great. It's true that recycled paper would be better, but there are also far worse sources of virgin pulp.

The paper gets caught on the wire.I was surprised and pleased to see (I almost wrote &#34;to note&#34;) that these notebooks open easily with no catching on the wire spiral.Nice!

The paper is smooth, a little thin, but all paper and cloth seems to get thinner every year.If you're looking for this type of notebook, these are good ones.
