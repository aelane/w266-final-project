It's a label. But it's a very good label. It's a label, right?! It is nice to have a large enough label to put both the address and return address. They are not quite as bright white as the typical label, due to the gray layer on the adhesive side, which is what makes them opaque.I use them as product labels. These will cover the old label so all that shows is the new information. I have not had a single label jam in the printer. Finally, they seem to resist wrinkling while being applied to boxes better that any other label i have used. You even can print one label at a time, instead of a whole sheet. As with any Avery label, these work seamlessly with the templates built into Word. Not much to really say about a label...but they do pull off easily, so what is most important, works well. Other then blocking whatever is underneath the label, these labels are no different than any other label that Avery makes.

I am therefore very happy to find a label with TrueBlock technology, but also one that works with laser printers which are less likely to bleed if the label gets wet.

If they are not easy to remove, the label can be easily torn.

If you hold the label up to the light, you might be able to make out what was underneath--but otherwise you can't see through it.They feed through printers without issue (even color lasers that may snake the labels through several rollers) and peel of cleanly.Do you need Avery labels for everything?
