What can you say about tape? I like this tape better than the Scotch brand that I used previously. You also get significantly more tape for your money, even compared to buying Scotch in bulk from Sams. But this tape is great and an amazing bargain. This is definitely the tape I will reorder in the future. Some tape isn't ant-shred so you wind up getting bits and pieces of tape when you peel on it. We use this tape in my shipping department.It is split resistant, abrasion resistant, it is pressure sensitive poly.Here's a key component: The tape length is 164 feet and the tape width is 1.88". This has to be compared to know how much tape you are really getting for your money.The tape rolls are bound together in outer packaging and are easy to use. The tape has not split and is working perfectly for us.I compared tape quantity with others online and this seemed to be the best value when needing tape quickly that's good quality. Other tape is thin, wrinkles when you try to use it, doesn't stick, and shreds when you take it off the roll. This tape doesn't have any of these problems. This tape costs the same, or less, that other tape being sold at 1/2 the length, or less. The tape works great and is a good value! It also works great on my tape gun. This is great strong tape for packing. This is very strong and thick tape, excellent for shipping heavy articles. It is much, much better than other packing tape I have bought which is thin and breaks easily (which is most of the brands at Home Depot). This is the stickiest tape I've EVER used.This is more sticky than the Duck HD and 3M top of line clear packing tapes, sticks to everything!Best of all, it's only 13 bucks for 6 long rolls! This tape is just fantastic!!! It is just as good as the expensive Scotch tape brand. You would think packing tape is packing tape but not so. This tape is great. I would highly recommend this tape to anyone who does frequent or infrequent shipments. I bought this tape based on the reviews. These tape rolls are huge - what an amazing value. I won't be running out of tape anytime soon but as soon as I do I'll get more of this. This tape does just fine.

This tape is much thicker and stronger than any of the packing tape I have bought in the past.

Finding packing tape and comparing prices can be like comparing apples to oranges.

Some will simply say they offer packing tape but not tell you the length...you get it and there isn't much tape on the roll.
