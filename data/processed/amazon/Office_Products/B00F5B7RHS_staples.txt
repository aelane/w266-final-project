It takes standard staples. Oh, make sure you have staples, they are not included. No staples at all come with it but the standard staples required are easy enough to find. They were right where I grip it to put staples in. It takes standard staples, but does not come with any. It also doesn't come with staples for you to start off with which is a minus for me. I'd have preferred staples over the bling, honestly. There are no staples included. I would also have preferred a few staples included with the pack so I can also start stapling right away. It takes standard staples.

This takes standard staples and the staples close completely around the back of the paper unlike bargain staplers.I was disappointed this didn't come with staples, but my biggest criticism is that this boasts over 200 stickers, but the majority of them are so tiny (the size of a pencil tip) and are VERY hard to manipulate, so I didn't use the tiniest ones.

Strangely enough, it comes with no staples at all -- not even a starter strip.But this isn't designed to be a run of the mill stapler.

Neither of the Swinglines came with staples but luckily I had a box on hand.
