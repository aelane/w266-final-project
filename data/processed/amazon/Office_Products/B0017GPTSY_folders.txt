There are 100 file folders here, and they are regular weight, but now regular weight is what used to be called lightweight. These folders are great for organizing my desk area and sorting papers into filing cases or boxes. Ever since working with manila folders in childhood to doing serious work as an adult, manila folders have been that often appreciated associate that for some reason likes to nick us once in a while...and sometimes too often.I've used these Cutless Manilas for quite a while now and so much appreciate them not giving me a deep gaping finger wound. These folders are incredibly sturdy and are made of good-quality paper. The folders are a strong, easy to write on and like they said no paper cuts... If I didn't know these new folders were "cutless," would I have noticed? I have been using these folders for over 30 years. Since you would be buying the folders to use, why not get a safety first one instead! I really like these folders and plan to continue to buy these. I really like these folders. These folders are not useful for this purpose, because the paper/cardboard from which they are made is pretty flimsy. Wife got a Band Aid, I got some dandy new folders I'd recommend to any serious worker.Smead does the job (I'll never be sure about the "cutless" part). Anyway, I compared these Smead folders to some Xerox Office Basics Manila File Folders ... the Smead folders does have a "rounded" edge ... so I guess this would reduce the chance of any cuts.At about 16 cents a piece these folders seem decent, not the heaviest duty folders around ... but good for basic filing needs. These Smead Third-Cut Cutless folders are however a bit sturdier than I thought they might be based on the flimsy nature of many recent Smead office-product purchases.This Smead Cutless Manila must derive the touted 'cutless' quality from the make-up of the manilla, because the edges on both the Ampad comparison folder and the Smead reviewed folder have the same cut and design; the middle tabs are rounded while the outer edge of the first and third tab are cut sharply rather than being rounded. If you want to use the folders for business and there will be a great deal of repeated removal and replacing, these Smead folders might not hold up over time, though at this point I can't say that for certain with anything other than assumption and previous experience.Being old enough to have lived well before computers and having had jobs where 100s of folders were removed and replaced every day, I have used a lot of folders in my life. These Smead Cutless folders will serve me fine, but when I feel the need for additional folders in the future, I likely will go back to the Accufile File Folders because I like the sturdiness and their overall feel. In the mean-time the Smead folders being reviewed do what exactly what file folders are meant to do. These Smead folders are "cutless," which means they have been specially designed to avoid paper cuts.How is this done? We don't use folders as much as we used to as a result. These folders are just fine for that job and they have 30% recucled content also. However, manila folders are mostly used to hold paper, and they generally all serve that function about equally.These particular manila folders are great at holding paper. These folders are third cut, which means that three of the manila folders can have the tabs staggered so that there is a left, middle, and right, making it easier to see labels. Conversely, I have seen manila folders so sturdy that they appear to be more akin to thick cardboard. These folders are cutless! These folders also include 30% recycled material, and apparently 30% is post-consumer. It is possible that these other folders might be less sturdy, and they may not have 30% recycled materials. These are fine folders, just what you expect. These folders are just as good if not better than any other file fold I have used in the past.They are made of good quality stock, nice and thick; not floppy and cheap like many other brands. As where most folders are just punch cut out of large sheets of stock, which can sometimes leave sharp paper edges which can lead to paper cuts. These folders have had the edges smoothed/dulled so there is no real threat of a paper cut happening to you during routine office work.Other than that these are just like your standard good quality file folders, a large tab on top to label the fold if need be and all that good stuff. Much more flimsy than the "usual" folders I've purchased over the years. I have to give the folders five stars because this was the brand of manila folders I order when I pay for folders on my own dime. Working with the folders, we do believe there is a considerable difference, and no one in the office has yet suffered a paper cut. However, we also believe the folders may be slightly thinner than standard Smead folders. We do appreciate that the folders are constructed of 30% post-consumer materials.
