The printer receives print jobs from multiple points in the house and spits them out reliably, although we DO have to use a workaround for the Macs and Apple products.I don't know if this is the fault of the printer, the operating system or the user, but for some reason the Macs do not acknowledge that the WorkForce Pro is online (even though the PCs do), and the iPad can see it through the app (which does not print but monitors the printer&#8217;s status) but otherwise indicates glumly that there is no airprint printers found.The workaround, not quite as convenient but still satisfactory, comes in the email address assigned to the unit, which allows us to print anything that we can ship as an attachment to an email.The email assigned to the unit initially, mind you, is a monster, but you have the option to change this from within the website, just as you can change your own information. The printer is an all-in-one machine: Printer, Copier, Scanner, 2-Sided Auto Duplex, ADF, and Fax. To compare with this printer, we also have a brother printer and it&#8217;s about $120 (Compatible Cartridges) to $250 (Genuine Cartridges) to replace all of our cartridges (more expensive). Overall, this printer performs very well and has great features, I highly recommend it for home office use. I really like the Epson printer. The printer is quite large/tall, in part due to having two separate paper trays, so you'll want to make sure that you have a large space with plenty of overhead before purchasing this.There's almost nothing that this printer doesn't do. The printer uses 4 ink jet cartridges (black, cyan, magenta, yellow), each of which is very large. I was excited to receive my Epson WorkForce Pro WF-4640 after my last printer (the Epson WP-4530) suddenly died out on us. I will admit, this printer is perhaps more machine than I need for my everyday printing, however, it was important to me that I get a high quality printer as I often need to print documents, spreadsheets and pictures from my home computer. After the printer did its &#8220;initial ink charging&#8221; which took about 10 minutes, I popped in the installation CD to my computer and after an additional 5-10 minutes, and a very easy wireless connection process, I was ready to print, and these pages printed within seconds. No more sitting there waiting as the printer takes its time pushing the ink back and forth across the page. Also gone are those annoying printer lines that often ruined my pictures if I did not have the printer on the highest quality setting. Even on this printer&#8217;s lowest setting I was quite impressed with how my pictures and documents turned out.The only down side that I have to this printer is the lack of directions. The printer's large LCD touch screen is very clear, gives precise instructions and feedback, and is easy to use. This printer also holds four times as much paper as my Canon and that is welcome.Apart from the standard copy, fax, scan, and print functions I can print from IOS devices using Airprint. The printer will print both the email and the attachment as if it were it were printing directly from Microsoft Word. It would have made the printer taller than I need and for my use the extra tray is not required. The printer simply responds to the one bottom tray and back feeder.In summary, I'm totally impressed with this machine from Epson. If a printer is perfect in every other way, but I find myself constantly shopping for ink, I will hate it. This printer is compact, yet larger than your average inkjet printer. After that the printer can be connected to the network very easily (wired or wireless) or connected to a computer using USB cable. So it's much quicker than your average inkjet printer. It's very convenient.The printer also acts as a copier; I normally scan and store documents as pdf and print them when needed. Overall, a very decent multi-functional printer with amazingly fast printing speeds for an inkjet printer. The printer comes with a disc for your Windows computer, though, for my netbook, I downloaded and installed the combo pack from Epson&#8217;s website as it was easier than connecting my USB DVD drive. So far, I love this printer and recommend it if you need to print a lot. The printer itself doesn't give you any information about this, you have to go to the start up manual, which also doesn&#699;t tell you much except to go to the Epson website and figure it out for yourself.I did not try the Fax machine since I don&#699;t have a land line anymore.Overall an excellent all-in-one system for a very reasonable price. I really was highly pleased with this printer...But it could be improved upon, I thought, by upping the ante with a bit of better speed and capacity. I was never printed from my Samsung Galaxy S3 until this printer and I think this is really a wonderful added feature and it works without fail too. This is not a printer you can sneak on the edge of your desk. I can honestly say I think this printer could easily match a laser printer in quality, and speed. I have found my new printer! But it is very functional.Now the printer itself. This printer has many great qualities, which I will discuss first. I glad I did!This printer is lightening fast, even with full color. This printer does have two cassettes (the drawer type), as well as one rear paper feed (as shown in the 3rd thumbnail of the product photos). Not only can this printer do everything I could have imagined, it does a few things I never even dreamed of. The printer arrived in a giant, heavy box and to say it was securely packed would be an understatement. Best printer we every had. My third Epson printer and absolutely satisfied as always! Second, it's a gorgeous printer with a very user friendly touchscreen. I'm a big Epson printer fan! This printer is perfection in every way! This is an exciting printer. I would find it difficult to believe this printer could unsettle during shipment.In terms of options, you get a TON of options with this printer.You can connect to your home/business network via Wi-Fi, allowing you to print from any network connected device (laptop/desktop/etc). Comparing to my old Canon MP-990 printer, the Epson text is about 50% cleaner and clearer on the same paper. This is one marvelous printer!The ink cartridges are huge and expensive, but they print so many pages that it comes out cheaper per page than any other ink-jet I&#8217;ve used. Even so, my other Epson printer was a snap to set up manually so Epson needs to make some software changes.The printer can automatically figure out which tray to take media from and it will automatically determine what type of media it is. This is a big, heavy printer. (To note: This printer is IDENTICAL to the Epson WorkForce Pro WF-4630, except for a couple of things:1.) The printer was shipped in its original box. The printer then takes about 10 minutes to load the ink, and it must perform this task uninterrupted. I was able to add the printer in OS X 10.9 and Windows 8 quickly, and both operating systems then offered printing and scanning to it.
