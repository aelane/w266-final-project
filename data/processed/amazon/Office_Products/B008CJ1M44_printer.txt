I've used this printer now for a few months. The printer has been stable and never lost connection since the set up.I find the menu and software to be very stable and simple to use. I used this printer rather heavily in an office setting. And it's still going strong!Overall I think this printer is fantastic. I would highly recommend this printer for anyone looking for a b/w office printer. While I'm using this printer in a home office environment as opposed to a small business office, I'm still very pleased with its functionality. Works well as a fast printer, copier, fax machine and scanner.Setting this multifunction apart, in a sea of Brother and other multifuncion machines, are the following 3 things:1. I love this printer.

Would be nicer to be able to send a PDF directly to the printer (or even a word doc) and have it print as is, but alas, no.

We have only just setup this printer, but have used other older models that are similar.

Even though the printer is monochrome, the scanning is full color.
