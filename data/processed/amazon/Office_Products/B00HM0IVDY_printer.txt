This is just a printer, not an all in one with scanner and fax included. However, it is a pretty fast printer for printing office docs, so if you're looking for mainly a printer and not an all-in-one it is much faster and allows printing of larger photos and documents.Pros:- Fast printing, prints several pages per minute, much faster than my all in one printer from Epson.- Wireless mode, was easily set up through the included CD which came with printer. This printer only has the standard on/off and error clear buttons, plus a Wi-Fi button that is about useless. I set the printer up with a USB cable (you need to do this first), installed drivers and everything, printed some test pages, and then tried to set up the wireless functions and the Canon wireless setup software can't find it. I am  happy to have this as a secondary printer, not too sure I'd buy as a primary... simply because I'm spoiled with the multi function options of my other. This printer is so good that it is difficult to know where to begin my accolades. It is a surprisingly fast printer. It isn't an all-in-one printer; it's just a printer - no scanner, no fax and no copy capability.I realize this is advertised to only be a business printer insinuating its photo capabilities to be perhaps at best average. I already own a Canon Pro-100 and the Canon Pro-9000 Mark II printer that print 13X19 photo prints, so I wasn't expecting this 5 ink printer's photo capability to be in the same league. Great straight forward printer that excels at printing! The printer arrived with a dent in the box, so I was hoping the jostling around it must have gotten during shipping did not harm the printer itself. I mention that because it indicates the printer is packed pretty well snug inside the box with styrofoam around it.If the large box wasn't indicative enough for you, once out of the box, you indeed notice the size of this printer. I downloaded the printer drivers and software through Canon's website with no problem. The printer needed to connect to the router, not to my computer/Mac. It was enabled, so the printer should have been recognized. However, since it wasn't I noticed that I could manually add the printer to my wifi network simply by clicking on &#34;add device.&#34;  I did that and voila! Otherwise you may be better off with a smaller printer. The printer stays on all the time but knows how to go to sleep when you're not using it. Still, this printer is great for printing out a huge spreadsheet or even a detailed map or graphic.The iX6820 is smaller than other 13x19 printers that I've used, but it's still pretty big. The printer has a pigment-based black ink and a dye-based black-ink. While I love my printer, it simply cannot handle printing large scale prints for small posters and large spreadsheets. Overall, it's a solid printer for pages over 8.5x11. We connected the printer to a computer with a USB cable, and had no problems. And once I opened it, I found so was the printer. Not too many different printer cartridges to deal with. Overall, a decent printer, but maybe not the choice for everyone, particularly if you don't really have a need to print large sizes. Good printer. I wish I could tell you how this printer worked but after hours of trying we could not get it to work. Overall I would give this printer an A- or so. I had the IX6820 printer hooked up to my home network and took some photos with my daughter and her friend on a little playdate. I did, but I also sent it to the printer right from my phone and sent her home with it. The printer uses five cartridges, three primary colors, picture black and document black. This printer does use tabloid- or even larger-size paper, which is nice. This is a specialized printer, meant to do larger size color printing well and with more graphics software. It's a good printer, and, in fact, it still works fine, but it is S-L-O-W. Glacially slow. All in all, though, this printer is fast, capable and produces excellent quality prints. I'd be surprised if any printer stood head-and-shoulders above the rest in terms of printing economy or ink usage. Remember, though, this is just a printer, not an all-in-one. This printer, the "Canon Office Products IX6820 Wireless Inkjet Business Printer" assembled very easily and it was a breeze to set up wireless, too. You can place the printer practically anywhere and do without cable clutter.The color inks, 4 separate tanks supplied are of a dye base and the 5th tank is the black, pigment based (which is bigger than the other cartridges for obvious reasons), all of which are very easily installed but using these inks may wind up being expensive; just something to be considered by some. I tested the printer's capability on both a black and white and a color photo, on an 8x11 metallic satin paper and there's good contrast and excellent detail with the black and white and the colors, too, which are exceptional as well; typical of the Canon PIXMA printers.It's a fast printer, too, getting the job done quickly, and I haven't found it to be excessively loud, either. What may be most important for many, though, is that this printer will output 13x19 prints. This printer sort of aims to be both but you'll never want to use this for business or student needs if you print a lot.I
