It seems to have good ink consumption and is appears exponentially better than the HP it replaced. The ink installs in seconds and there was no trouble there at all.The next step was to load the software. It was slow, gobbled ink like it was candy, and just never really met my needs.Trading up to this Epson Workforce Wireless All-in-One was like swapping hamburger for prime rib and for not an insane price tag either.After 3 months of use I've printed photos and coupons, documents for business purposes and kids' school stuff daily and only just now am I getting a message that it's time to buy new ink cartridges. The ink cost is the only thing I can say I don't like.Note: The only feature I haven't made use of yet is the fax machine, it's just simply not a feature I need more than once or twice a year but is really nice to have. I have not had it long enough to judge how long the ink cartridge lasts and so haven't calculated a price per page yet.I really like this printer. If you are familiar with the ink cartridges in the Brother lasers--well they cost about $200 plus to replace the full spectrum and you are suppose to replace the drum etc. I had just a regular small only black ink printer and this machine looked like it was going to be very complicated to set up, especially since it is wireless and I had absolutely no clue how that would work. It does go through ink fairly quickly. As for the ink, while it bothers me to pay so much to replace all the ink cartridges, the ink cost is in line with printers from other companies.Bottom line: It's a great printer at a great price. However, sometimes Epson can be very ticky about wanting JUST Epson ink. It's their ink monitoring software and it is really my only complaint with Epson. Also, the ink to me is going to be a problem I think, as with other Epsons I've had I was running out ALL the time. You can check your ink levels by use of the touch screen which like everything else about this printer is very convenient.In regards to printing out labels I find that this does a very decent job at keeping the information inside the lines. I haven't noticed heavy ink usage. I buy the large ink cartridges and they are expensive, but they seem to last a long time. So will wait until I replace them to really check ink usage. Also, the generic ink works great in this printer. Also, the ink I found to be a little expensive to replace. It will prompt you to install the ink cartridges (included).

The 4530 comes with more initial ink (larger cartridges).

I'm going back to Canon, I don't care how much ink I go through - time is money and it makes my dogs uncomfortable when I swear.A footnote: When looking at the 4 1/2 star rating, bear in mind that there are twice as many Vine Program reviews than there are unbiased reviews from people who actually purchased this printer.Changed my review to one star.

It also told me I was low on ink so I thought to replace that cartridge before starting the next round of printing to avoid more mysterious errors.
