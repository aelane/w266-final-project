I always knew EXACTLY where the tape was- as it didn't get hidden under wrapping or packaging since it was held securely in place by the suction cup on the bottom. It was quite handy and the tape pieces are the exact perfect size. However, I never thought getting tape off the roll dispenser was a chore so I don't have a need for this. The tape pops up with ease and the strips are of good size. No more getting tape balled up as you are trying to hold your wrapping paper in place, get out tape, and tape it all at same time. If you don't pull the tape up exactly straight, the dispenser will pull in the direction of the tape, so you have to keep a finger or your other hand on it to hold it steady. I wouldn't mind if it were slightly taller so it could hold more tape. This tape comes in a round pop up dispenser. The tape pops up in strips.I liked this product. The tape works fine and the dispenser works fine--especially when compared to those disposable tape varieties. I can dispense tape at any length I need, the dispenser can be moved anywhere (including capreted floors) to be used conveniently, and it is MUCH more economical than the pop-up version. I never found dispensing tape from the old-fashioned dispenser to be troublesome so this product does not have any true value for me personally. Summary:  Fast and Easy but Scotch is trying to make sticky tape as expensive as printer ink!For most people, a generic office tape dispenser would be a better choice. The tape comes out smoothly, while making a clack noise as it comes out. If you pull the tape out slowly, it won't make the clack noise, but it sometimes doesn't come out cleanly and sometimes won't come out as a single strip.Great little product. If you just need clear tape and have both hands available, it is much more cost effective to just buy a standard roll of tape.The tape strips are exactly two inches long, and they come out of the product very easily. You need at least double the tape to make it worthwhile.That being said, if you are a crafter/scrapbooker and this type of tape delivery appeals to you, you won't be disappointed -it is a solid product. This tape dispenser works well. grab away at some tape and use it up. I could just as easily use regular tape and pre-cut it into strips on the edge of a table.That being said, the dispenser itself is durable, and the tape pops up quickly and without hassle.A great gadget for the holidays, but it won't be replacing my regular old-fashioned tape dispenser anytime soon. Just slide it open, slip the tape in and give it a pull... it's easy as that... The tape sections are pre-cut into 75 strips, so you don't have to worry about cutting off the tape. Typically I'm pulling the tape upwards anyway when I want it, so no real adjustment was needed on my part.It functions perfectly well as a tape dispenser, plus it has the novelty of being able to slide along surfaces without easily being lifted. It tape and dispenser works as advertised, although I elected not to adhere the base permanently to any particular surface. just when you thought that tape dispensers were all the same, this comes along.you might think this is gimmicky but it's not. Pop-up tape function works well.CONS:1. Although not as tall as a standard tape dispenser, this Deskgrip dispenser seems to take up about as much desk area as a standard dispenser (it is round, not narrow - to me, a wash on deskspace);4. Unlike a traditional tape dispenser with a roll and a cutter, each strip is precut and uniform. Unlike regular tape, this tape does not have a knife on it to cut the strips. The standard tape lengths are just right for most things, and I've found I've use it several times just sitting around here without even thinking to. No more bulky tape dispenser on my desk! You still could use a regular tape dispenser and get the job done and not need the special tape that you have to buy to refill this.I like it, but I am afraid this product won't sell for very long because the upkeep cost is just too high and not worth the price of admission long term. This is somewhat like a tape dispenser being mounted on a hockey puck that glides on ice. This tape dispenser beats those typical office tape dispensers because it has a suction grip and 'pre-cut' strips of tape. The tape was simple to insert and the fact that it suctions down to a hard surface well is priceless when trying to tape things one handed. If you break it down, this tape is expensive!Here's my take on it. I think that the typical desk-style tape dispenser, the one that's been around for years and is heavy, works better and is more quickly moved from place to place. Scotch tape comes out in neat rectangles, each about the length of a finger phalanx - just perfect. The self-adhesive tape is probably one of the greatest innovations of all time. And yet the tape dispensers, advanced as they were when they first appeared, have changed relatively little over the years. Granted, it is pricier than the regular tape, and most of us don't spend our waking hours wrapping gifts. First, you get the clear, invisible Scotch tape that you know and love. The pop-up tape is great and has strong hold, as it always happen with Scotch tape in my experience, but the dispenser itself does not work for me. Pulling the tape out of the dispenser is a little awkward, as it catches at times. The weighted, desktop tape dispensers are a pain because they often don't stay put when you're trying to tear off tape with one hand. I just might splurge for those tape refills! One that would be bound to be much more expensive than just the little tape dispenser we've all used for years. The tape dispenser does kind of suction to your table, but it slides around a lot. I honestly don't find myself needing tape very often, but this little thing is very handy. tape right at your fingertips. Sometimes the tape would not tear cleanly even with the right flick of the wrist. The tape comes in stack of precut tabs about 2 inches in length. Inserting a new tape pad is very easy. To load tape you have to slide part of the cover open. Unless taking tape off the regular dispenser is a chore for you. Yet, it can slide horizontally to be placed closer to you and slid away when not needed.It was easy to load with the tape module. I mean, yeah, store-brand and bargain-brand tape is a pain to get into precise lengths, but this is a Scotch tape product - I've never had a problem with tearing Scotch tape unless it's very old tape, and I'm pretty sure that this dispenser would suffer the same problem.It does have its uses, though, particularly if you have a child who, like mine, believes that a one-inch tear needs a one-foot length of tape to repair it. This tape dispenser is fantastic. These pop-up tape strips help in a couple of ways. The pop-up tape dispenser is easy to use. I loved using this tape dispenser. The tape popped out every time with just one piece, it's good and sticky, and made it much easier to wrap a package. The tape strips are cut and as you pull one out, another strip pops up behind it, ready to use. It is much cheaper, even with the "wasted" tape to just buy the regular roll of tape. Scotch's new refillable pop-up tape dispenser is very convenient, especially when you're needing short pieces of tape on a regular basis. The tape pops up out of the main compartment and magically gives you this 1 1/2 inch piece of tape....no scissors required. Basically this is a tape product, so you probably have had some experience with tape in the traditional form. I inserted the tape into the dispenser, and handed it to them for their artwork. I especially liked that they couldn't "accidentally" unroll too much tape, as these little gems are only 2 inches long.The suction cup on the bottom of the dispenser holds securely to my computer table (even when pulling a strip of tape out); and when I need to move it, it easily slides off the edge of the table.While I will probably use the old style "tape on a roll" for my gift-wrapping needs, I'll definitely keep a fewScotch PopUp Tape Refills, 0.75 x 2 Inches, 1 Pad per Pack (99-G)on hand for the grandchildren. Once you learn how to get the tape in the holder correctly this dispenser works fine and does make it easier to tape something. I had it loaded with tape and affixed on the top of my desk in under 30 seconds. The tape door slides open easily and closes with a snap. The tape comes out easily, eliminating the tearing across the cutting teeth used in most dispensers, which has the benefit of providing smooth edges when applying the tape instead if leaving a serrated edge that can stand out against certain packaging materials.The mounting mechanism for this dispenser is simple. I am so digging these pop up tape strips!They are incredibly convenient, making one handed projects, such as wrapping gifts, so much easier to do. No needing me to give them tape! Between this handy tape dispenser and the humongous stockpile of wrapping paper purchased from nieces and nephews, I am thoroughly prepared for the holiday season.The awesome rubber base sticks securely to slick surfaces like desktops (or in my case the linoleum floor in the kitchen), and it dispenses just the right amount of tape *one-handed* (so you can hold the wrapping paper with the other hand - while attempting to repel the cats with your feet and legs).I love this dispenser - I can't tell you how many times the tape didn't tear or was otherwise mangled with traditional dispensers, ending up wrapped around my fingers or in my hair!Update: I loaned this to a co-worker with Celiac (did you know there is gluten in envelope adhesive?) So far, no wasted tape: the hole the tape strips pop out of are cruved so they grab the next strip rather than leaving it hanging in the breeze to collect dust. I lose tape rolls like no one's business, so with this stationary wonder, I will probably save a nice chunk of change and time. The tape comes out smoothly and the dispenser removes from the desktop leaving no sticky residue to clean off. Plua, all of the tape strips are perfect. No, the tape doesn't disappear completely, so don't be fooled.All in all, it's good, strong tape, but I'm going back to using my old dispenser.ETA: This might be a good dispenser to give to kids, now that I think about it, since it will prevent them from taking extremely long pieces, and there are no sharp edges exposed. I guess it could be considered the Safety Scissors of the tape world! The tape pieces are the sizes you usually need to using tape. This pop-up tape dispenser stays on a desk or table surface without adhesive. That is, the tape is pre-cut to a length that is appropriate for most home or office uses. I would guess that the pop-up tape packs would be much more expensive to produce than long spools of tape. You have to really snatch the tape strip with some force otherwise you get two stuck together. I also hated that each tape strip came out with the end bent making it difficult to place the strip. it uses the seemingly convenient, but expensive, pre-cut tape strips from Scotch. But the next tape did not appear in the slot, and I found it very difficult to dismantle the device to correct the problem. This is a really cool tape dispenser. The tape is just the right size too - not too small or big. With most tape dispensers, two hands are needed to hold the dispenser and pull a piece of tape. When I first got this tape dispenser, it appeared that it was not an improvement over a standard tape dispenser. The tape sizes are fixed at 2" long X 3/4" wide so if you need a large piece of tape a traditional tape dispenser wins out over this product. This holds the tape dispenser in place and eliminates the need to hold the dispenser with the other hand when you're pulling a piece of tape out. However, Don't through away your standard tape dispenser. This tape dispenser is an addition to the original which was "wrist mounted" with an elastic strap. I use less tape overall, waste less, and spend about the same amount on tape with the convenience of pre-cut pieces.This dispenser is easier to use one handed than the one made for wrist mounting, so I rate it 4 stars rather than 5 because I wish it were just a little heavier. I got the green colored one, it was very easy to load the tape refill.

It is very hard to pull the tape up without 2 hands.

I am bad at planning my tape use.

Not the tape; 3M did that long, long ago.
