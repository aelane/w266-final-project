I think you are better off purchasing regular post it notes, or something more portable that you don't have to stick to a hard item, and use those instead.HOWEVER, all that being said, there IS a use for these. Will now have to purchase one for myself since I am a post it fanatic. I love pop up post its. For me however I need more than the 20 post stick notes it provides. I like post its, I've been using them ever since Romy and Michelle came up with the idea (Yes that joke is for the movie buffs out there)These Note dispensers are great; I have one next to my desktop at home, one at work and one I gave to my son. They do what they're supposed to do, which is hold the post it notes in one easy to reach spot.I would just advice you to chose wisely where you place the dispenser, because the adhesive on its back only seems to work good once, it loses its grip if you ever decide to place it elsewhere. I mean, post it packs aren't exactly large, and they're not exactly difficult to pick off of a post it note stack on their own.This is just another way to repackage an item that's already fine the way it is. Well, I am a post it fan..I have post its all over my desk,in many colors and shapes,  and I go through them like water. Sure, the top post it note gets damaged, but as for the post-it holder, its a lot sturdier than I thought it would be, and I have to say, although I am not certain its the greatest deal, it is useful if you need to write a note and give it to someone off your computer, it is pretty handy. These post it notes would work to use by your phone, but also when you are out and about. The post it notes are the typical yellow post-its that, with the same quality you would expect. I love post it notes and have them all over the place. I love these little post it notes. I love post it products! I just keep the post it notes loose on my desk.I suppose if it was very important to be able to attach a post it note dispenser to your laptop, this might be a product that you would need or want.
