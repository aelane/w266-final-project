So, we assembled the box and then used a box cutter to slice it into two sections. I was thinking that when I was opening the box; therefore, I did open it carefully, so now I have 5 instead of 4.Good boxes. The adjustable box consists of four identical pieces, each box four inches thick with two closed and two open sides. So don't throw away the box, (and be careful when you open it up, so that you don't destroy a good packing box), you can get FIVE boxes to use instead of the four that are inside! The box that comes with the items can also be used to ship out so it is like you are getting an extra box. This is a really strange box; it is a four part telescoping box that can be used for something up to 40 x 60 x 4 inches (a really big picture).I was completely stumped on how to use this box until I visited the smooth move website. Essentially the box is four corners. You start by placing one box on a corner. Then slip a second box over the next corner, and run tape down the face to join the two corner boxes. And finally, finish the box with the fourth corner and taping all the loose cardboard down. The box itself comes in four pieces that you can adjust. The box these came in held up quite well in shipping without so much as a dent. This box, which has handles, can also be used for those awkward items. They come folded up in another box - which I also used to pack some art! when you need a large box(s) of unusual sizes, specially heavyweight, its not easy to find them... to get these in a bundle, and shipped from Amazon via Prime, and they have solved this annoying problem...the boxes are well made, heavy duty, could not be more happy.... The box is sturdy, but probably wouldn't be used for multiple moves. Review for adjustable moving box: Excellent way to pack your pictures or mirrors when moving. The adjustable box comes in 2 parts and you just slide them together. This is a nice box. Constructing the box is easily a one person job. The box is easy to hold together while taping the flaps down. Outside of box has lines for labeling each, makes it easy to sort in storage. This box is highly protective and easy to use. This box is very sturdy (and heavier than expected), and offers excellent protection. And, as I mentioned in the other box reviews, be sure to carefully open the box these come in as that is truly a 5th box for your move. Not very exciting, and it feels rather unfortunate to have to buy a box, since so often I'm overflowing the recycling to get rid of all the cardboard that came in the mail that week. Sturdy and hardy box for keeping pictures or canvas photos.
