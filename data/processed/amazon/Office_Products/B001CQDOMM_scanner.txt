This scanner is perfect for on the go scanning of receipts and business cards. If you simply need a scanner - even an iPhone does the trick or most printers come with scanners, however this device has the included software which helps categorize your receipt entries which is the more useful feature.Pros:Handy scanner with a small footprint, great size if you like to take it alongReads receipts nicely, even the faded ones and organizes into receipts or documents (if receipt is non decipherable)Cons:Low resolution, best for black and white scanning of receipts/ business cardsNot meant for photo scanning or even complex document scanningSoftware does not recognize handwritten numbers like additions of tips at the end of restaurant receiptsNot very user friendly for importing into financial software - for Quicken you will have to do some pre-work and organize your own foldersRelatively slow scanning, you have to manually feed in the receipts one by oneOverall this is a useful device if you need a dedicated receipt and business card scanner. If you need a multipurpose scanner to scan books and large documents, all in one scanners will work better with better resolution. This portable scanner works very well to scan receipts and invoices and to store them with tags for easy archiving. It also doubles as a scanner, enabling you to make copies, ready to send in an email, or print them on your networked laser printer that are clean, accurate, and quick. I thought it was just a scanner that sucked down receipts and put them on my laptop in read form. If the scanner cannot read your receipt, you can edit the item. I own both the NeatDesk and now the NeatReceipts scanner as well. But even back when I first installed the NeatDesk scanner, I found the operation of the unit and most software applications to be fairly intuitive.Apparently, they are still refining the software and it appears that it's not ready for Prime Time just yet. The NeatReceipts scanner comes with a soft carrying case, the USB connector, NeatWorks software and mine also came with a handy complimentary ABBYY PDF Transformer Pro 2.0, which allows one to create, edit and convert documents to and from the .pdf format. You can sore this little scanner almost anywhere. The NeatReceipts mobile scanner intends to scan your business cards, receipts, or any document and store in a database (or catalog as NeatReceipts calls it). If you absolutely need a scanner while you travel, this is a great option. The scanner itself is a pretty common USB powered (unfortunately no 'cloud' syncing or wifi scanning) device. I wish the scanner didn't have to be connected to a computer, ie could have a wifi option, or have memory in it that when you opened it on a device (any device) would pull them all in. I needed a basic scanner for the occasional document that had to be scanned and emailed, preferably scanned into pdf format. So far, the scanner has been terrific - it's small and convenient, plugs in easily into a USB port and documents scan quickly and clearly. This is just a scanner, right? I use the scanner, but with other software, because the software that came with it was too cumbersome.I had to purchase something new each time I upgraded my computer, when all I needed was a new driver.I did some research and discovered there are other scanners on the market with better customer support and more streamlined software. But if you don't really need it, this scanner is just clutter. It was a great little scanner, with a great range of functionality. I do it at the scanner, and I now know to do it while the software is loading. Have found that this mobile scanner does a good job scanning even wrinkled receipts that can be exported into Excel and Quicken, and scanning documents that can be exported into searchable PDF files is easy with the supplied NeatWorks 4.0 software.&#9670; Pros:+ Lightweight and compact, weighs less than a pound.+ Fits easily into a notebook or laptop computer case.+ Scans and exports documents into searchable PDF files.+ No external power needed, powered by USB cable (included).+ Performs its scans quickly.&#9670; Cons:- No cons found originally, but see the update below.As an added bonus, found that images can be saved in JPG format, which is a handy plus point for this reviewer, especially when going through old family photos. It's worth considering if you want to keep your scanner and USB cable in a convenient place in about any notebook computer case.&#9670; Summary:Have barely scratched the surface regarding the capabilities of this very handy mobile scanner, and am impressed so far by the capabilities of the NeatWorks 4.0 software. Since this scanner was picked up, it has been used with my Windows 7 notebook and with my Windows 8.1 notebook, and it has become twitchy with both. I have a flatbed scanner that is not convenient to do document scanning since you have to lift the cover, position the page, scan, crop, save, etc. This is a nice portable scanner and the software works well. This scanner was very easy to set up straight from the box. Once it was downloaded and I hooked up the scanner to my computer I found it very easy to use! I recently started using this scanner and am thus far reasonably impressed.I think it is important to manage expectations. I tested the scanner and software on a MacBook Pro, late spring 2008, Mac OS X 10.5.7, with 4 GB RAM.NeatReceipts Mobile Scanner and Digital Filing System for MacNeat Company has an "organized" vision--it starts with their product packaging, which presents the product in stages as you open it. The scanner itself is a bar with a USB cord, just wide enough to accept 8.5" wide paper. The scanner seemed to do a great job of OCR even though it was photographs with magazine callouts overlaid.My wife also has a hard time with our network-connected AIO when she needs to scan, I think she will be very happy with the simplicity of this model. With my other scanner, you need to open Apple's scanner utilityI had previously tested their larger desk scanner, but didnt like all the space it took up, I dont like peripherals laying around in general - but this one takes up no desk space - it fits right under my iMac monitor - and since it has no power adapter, can be quickly unplugged and stuck in a drawer if it really bothers me, while being easily at hand.On the downside, if you dont have the neatworks app open when you press scan, Mac's Image Capture will open instead. I have been meaning to get a scanner for a few years now. Low and behold -- this scanner appeared!It comes with the scanner, the cable, a CD (with already out-of-date software. That said, using the scanner to take care of my messy habits is all I need, and I can back up Neat's documents to my Time Machine and Dropbox.It's as simple as can be - start up Neat's software, feed a receipt into the long slit of the scanner, and press "scan". This scanner is very small and does a pretty decent job.In the box, you find:- The Scanner- Cloth bag- USB cable- CD manual and install disk- Various cleaning and calibration materialsSet up:Put the CD in your computer, run the install program and read the instructions. Be sure to calibrate your scanner when the install instructs you to. The scanner itself is nothing fast or special in my opinion. I need a scanner that will allow me to keep pushing receipts through quickly without stopping, and then manipulate the PDF.If you aren't needing powerful software to extract data and manipulate & organize it, I highly recommend theFujitsu SCANSNAP S1100 CLR 600DPI USB Mobile Scanner (PA03610-B005)simply because it's a little faster, does better at re-aligning a receipt to straight during a scan, and I prefer the paper guides and way it opens. I'll probably stick with this scanner for most of my day to day quick receipt pile scanning.Putting these two scanners head to head, just for hardware functionality, I prefer the Scansnap. The scanner is fine.
