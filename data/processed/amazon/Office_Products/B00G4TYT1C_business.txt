It comes with &#34;business card size&#34; notepaper in the bottom slot, which would be difficult to replace. The lower one holds business cards horizontally and the upper one holds them vertically. I recommend this Swingline business card holder to Amazon shoppers. Swingline's acrylic business card user is a hefty piece of plastic. This business card holder is made of a really thick clear acrylic. I really was surprised when I received this business card holder. This is an absolutely stunning business card holder. This business card holder shines and catches the light almost like cut glass or crystal.It's very stylish and attractive and creates a positive impression on your business.It holds business cards vertically and has a horizontal space for paper notes. I suppose you can also add business cards below as well as small note paper.It's easy to clean and seems very sturdy.Recommended! At first I thought this was one of those cheap simple business card holders but when I got it I noted right away that it was different. This is an elegantly designed business card holder. So, when I first saw this business card holder, I was a bit hesitant, for, it was hard to judge how much space it would take up on a work space/desk. It holds quite a few business cards (sorry, I didn&#8217;t test the limits and count, but I&#8217;d guesstimate around 50&#8230;but that is packing them in there, I&#8217;d think). I find that they are so handy to have there by the business cards so that One doesn&#8217;t have to search in the desk to write that quick note/memo, phone number, email address, or whatever quick little bit of info. The same goes for business cards. This is a great business card holder. This business card is perfect for placing on my table so that people can grab a business card. One up top that I like to use for our own business cards because that's more like a display slot. I can put these face down so it looks neater.Weight- This business card holder has a pretty decent weight to it. This is elegant and simply well done.It holds the business cards at a forward angle, making them easy to read and pick up.
