(Now all they need is a biodegradable, waterproof sticky note with the extra strip & then they'd be ABSOLUTELY perfect! One has to pry up a corner.- Once I had the note out and ready to post, the extra sticky made it difficult to figure out which end of the sheet had the "real" sticky. Most of the entire note felt sticky on the back.- It really didn't make any difference, because the sticky notes do not stick; they begin to come off almost immediately. But I cannot recommend this sticky note package until the product is better. **See my note above about peeling off the note**. The sticky note has become a standard product that we all use. It does help hold the note down more securely and keeps it from curling. It definitely holds the note down tighter, but I didn't have any trouble pulling it back off. Living in Southwest Florida and having every Post-It note placed curl up immediately like a Shrinky Dink from the humidity, the second strip of adhesive is GREAT. As a sticky note junkie, when these came up on Vine, I of course ordered them! One of those is the classic "sticky note. "The classic sticky note, though, has a few drawbacks. Now, the sticky note has two lines of attachment to the surface it's on.Now, the note doesn't curl up and get easily pulled off. Take an adhesive note pad and quickly determine which edge is the top - generally this isn't an issue as one edge is usually somewhat lifted from the rest. Each sticky note is probably stuck to the wall, starting from when written, an average of 4-6 times. The sticky note is a great addition to any home office, study desk or work office. What sets these apart from your average sticky note is that there is a second adhesive strip at the bottom of the note to get rid of the annoying page-curling problem. I don't know why exactly, but the adhesive seems weak and the sticky note paper seems to only want to curl upward, resulting in a maddening curly sticky note that won't stay put. I love to be able to grab a bright note to jot down something important and place it for someone else to read. Finally, a sticky note that has sticky across the top AND bottom. This assures that your note will stay put. Only about the bottom third or fourth of the note will curl upward. When I move the note from 'to do' over to the 'done' page, they just look so nice and tidy. With a traditional sticky note, they curl up all of the time. So when I have a note stuck on say, some travel plans -- the top sticky edge strangely enough curls up. In the past I would tear a sticky note into four vertical strips which had adhesive on one end. The note stays on the page through the printer. Immediately after placing the note, it lays flat but after a few minutes or hours the note starting curling up. I've tried peeling a note off the pad from different angles as well as peeling slower/faster. I've also tried pressing the note more firmly down. The 3M note never started curling or un-sticking during the test. I'm not sure if 3M makes a lay-flat note like this product, however, which could have the same problem if it had the second stick row.Avery's lay-flats are a good idea but implemented poorly. This now requires a second sticky note, which in the line of work I do, means I will be going through more of these than ever until they come out with larger sizes that have the dual glue strips. These differ from a standard sticky note by having a second line of adhesive. As with the standard sticky note there is a line of adhesive between the "top" 2 corners. So the note is still really good at curling up from that point. Anytime you affix a standard post-it note to something, and then leave that note there for any length of time, the paper starts to curl and/or the notes start to flutter in the breeze, fall off, or simply look messy. On a positive note, the paper itself is a good quality, as is used in other Avery sticky notes. The double sticky note is a wonderful product for me. They also stand out when leaving a note on a refrigerator or counter top. Avery has designed a sticky note line with some innovative ideas. The extra adhesive makes the note more secure, far less likely to peel off by accident, and more suitable for uses when the note has to last a longer time. Who would have thought the post-it note could be improved? "Lay Flat" is pretty much not true.Essentially, what we have here is a sticky note with a second strip of sticky near the bottom. But that doesn't mean they won't work if all you need is a common sticky note.
