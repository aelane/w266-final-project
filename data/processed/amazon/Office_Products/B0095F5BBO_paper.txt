The Canon Pro 10 also does not handle roll paper as my R2880 does and that may be relevant if you're printing long panorama style photos that are not standard size. Photo paper isn't cheap, either, but for an enthusiastic amateur or a budget-minded professional, I would suggest this printer. It doesn't come with an onboard paper tray and honestly I wouldn't buy it as a combo photo/regular printer. For me I mostly use photo paper, so this isn't a deal breaker, but it could be for you.Overall this is a great budget photo printer that can do wide printing, and does it well. (Also 13x19 paper looks like a gag gift the first time you see it.) Two-way paper feeding provides a rear tray for most supported media types and a dedicated manual feed in the back of the printer for easy loading of thicker papers. The paper feed on the PRO 10 is centered where the 9000 was off right. The paper alignment is easier to work with on the PRO 10. I used Aperture to print to this paper and the results were a bit dark, but the colors and print quality were great.

The Pro-100 maintained the paper's original high-glare finish, while the Pro-10 matted the gloss down a bit, resulting in a VERY smooth print.

Expect more paper jams with this one.-Can print roll paper for panoramic-Since it is pigment, less variation in finishes as ink sits on top of the paper.-Must be turned on and nozzle check pattern printed 1x/wk to prevent clogging.

Load the top paper tray as that is where it will look for paper.
