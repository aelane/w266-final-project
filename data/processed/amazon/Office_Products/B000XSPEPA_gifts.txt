But being able to wrap gifts without picking up and putting down the tape--and misplacing it--over and over again is the main function of this product, and it definitely does what it's supposed to do. They come in handy (pun intended) especially when wrapping Christmas gifts. Wrapping several gifts under time pressure made me really appreciate this dispenser. This seems perfectly-designed for wrapping Christmas gifts that are a complex shape, where the paper needs one hand to hold it down. I was able to wrap my gifts much faster too. It's small, convenient, and makes wrapping gifts much easier. I found that when wrapping large gifts this 2 inch length is just not enough. I've been wrapping gifts for years and it just isn't too hard to use a normal tape dispenser to justify the need to purchase something like this. But if she ever asks me to help wrap gifts again, next time I'll bring this with me. (I absolutely loathe wrapping gifts. I've wrapped gifts hundreds of times with ordinary tape and wouldn't you know it-the gifts get wrapped just fine!

I wouldn't wrap gifts without it.

I tested it out wrapping some gifts and the performance was good.
