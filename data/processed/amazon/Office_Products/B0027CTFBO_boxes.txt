These boxes are easy to make, extremely sturdy, and reusable many times over. Most boxes you get do not have handles, but this feature makes these even more desirable because they are easier to carry. The boxes also have preprinted sections for writing what room they go in and what the contents are. The boxes are a little pricey, but the convenience, reliability and usability make them a very worthwhile investment. The Fellowes boxes come in various sizes. These boxes are fast to open and durable. There are shipping boxes and the shipping box that UPS delivered to my doorstep - way inside the garage, actually, even though he was TOLD MORE THAN ONCE not to leave anything anyplace the dogs could reach - and there were half a dozen large, heavy, solid boxes inside it.It was my little daughter's birthday today and she thought it was some special surprise present but what we got was half a dozen moving boxes inside a large shipping box. Until then, the boxes get a 5-star rating for design, roominess and quality and they get to go to the basement to be filled up with future yard sale material. These boxes have a clever design that allows you to fold them open to usable shape in seconds. More importantly, they're not the cheapest boxes around (most of the time when I move I manage to find most of my boxes for free). These boxes worked great for moving my office supplies from one floor to another. You could easily use these boxes over and over again without ruining them by the buckling. I'm quite pleased with the boxes. These boxes exceeded my expectations. Unlike the boxes you'll get from the grocery store for your move, you'll want to break these down (which is MUCH easier than breaking down taped boxes) and hang on to them. The boxes are sturdy and easy to fold out and together, with built in fold over lid. These boxes arrived today and are great. We still have 2 boxes left over. If you just want boxes for STORAGE only, I would probably go for banker's boxes. I think if packing up my million boxes for another move, not having that nerve jarring screech of packing tape dispenser would mellow it out- just a little. These no-tape boxes are more difficult to flatten and even after flattening they are very cumbersome to carry to wherever you have to take them for disposal. I have bought boxes from a variety of vendors (U-Haul, etc) and most of them are identical. These boxes are different.To start with, they fold together in such a way that tape is not needed. I found that hard to believe before I saw the boxes, but it's true. More expensive than other boxes but worth it! Many of these free boxes do not have flaps on the top and thus offer no protection for your goods. With the cheaper boxes, an overstuffed box will cause the sides to bulge, making it more likely to spill the contents after lifting.I like the construction of Fellowes 0062801 Medium Smooth Move Moving Box and I like the positive experience that they bring to the packing process. These boxes can actually be used for other purposes besides moving, such as general storage, making them a good multi- purpose box for all of your storage and packing needs. I love these boxes... first off, there's no need for tape and with ordinary boxes, you end up folding the bottom, taping and praying it holds so your stuff doesn't end up coming out the bottom when you move the box - no worries about that with these - just pop that box open, push down the flap at the bottom, load it up and go. These nice boxes are perfect for that storage. (the worst to salvage from)These boxes are strong and self stabilizing so that you dont need to reinforce the bottom with tape, or need to use tape on them at all. Most impressed with how the boxes quickly fold back down once you're done so you can reuse these in the future by conveniently storing them in the closet. They are more solid than the freebie boxes you get so you don't need to worry about the bottoms falling out and damaging your valuables.These boxes are a bit spendy but they are reusable and I highly recommend them! These boxes are broken down as easily as they are set up, all without tape. I'm storing most of these boxes until I need them again; I'm using two for general storage in a closet.Overall, I'm very satisfied. I now have 3 of the 6 boxes filled and neatly stacked in a corner. I can now see how much easier these boxes would have made my last move. These are not your everyday boxes. These smooth moving boxes by Fellowes are pretty neat boxes. I used these boxes to pack my clothes and it's wonderful I don't have to pull out any tape when I am done. You can reuse these boxes often and are durable enough to refold and store away.The rule of thumb for packing is don't pack more in a box than you can carry comfortably by yourself. These big boxes are meant for light items and will not be able to handle the weight of a desktop tower even if it will fit.Fellowes makes small and medium size boxes. It stays securely closed after you load it up.Finally, my boxes were packed inside an outer box of corrugated cardboard. Therefore, my moving boxes arrived clean, unscratched, structurally sound, etc. These boxes are handy, although I'm not sure they're a perfect substitute for traditional moving boxes. However, they don't seem to be quite as strong or sturdy as regular moving boxes that you tape together. these boxes rock. these boxes can be used quite a few times - because while we were moving we were reusing the boxes. These moving boxes are made of heavy duty, partially recycled cardboard, and are also great for storage. Yes, they are more expensive than some moving boxes, but they are very well made and can be used over and over again. Got these boxes for use around my old law office. These boxes were easy to use, held together well and did the job they were intended to do. I hate buying boxes but this is a good choice. I literally LOVE these boxes! These boxes assemble easily and the best part is that no tape is required. The boxes are great for storage of heavy items like books and file folders (I have the small size) but are not so good for frequently accessed items since the top is not that easy to open. As far as moving boxes go, highly recommended. These boxes are also extremely convenient for storage, and the smooth exterior and the symmetrical form factor enable one to efficiently stack several these in the storage space. These boxes made our messy garage storage area into a neat, easily accessible, and roomier space. These are very sturdy boxes that arrived flattened out and well packaged. These boxes are made for moving rather than storage (hence the no-lid assembly) but these are really heavy duty nice sized boxes that I actually use to store more long term items that I won't need to access for long periods of time.The Fellowes BB are easy to assemble without much confusion and they're sturdy so they don't bulge out much even when completely stuffed. I have previously used moving boxes from the likes of Uhaul and Bekins, which were pretty much the same. They are sturdier than other moving boxes I have used and are much better for stacking. These boxes were much bigger than I anticipated. I am very happy with these boxes overall and would use them again for moving. I used these boxes exclusively for storage, but I know I will use them for moving sometime in the early future.They are quite easy to assemble. I've used the lidded Banker's boxes before for filing purposes. Lidded Banker's boxes and copy paper boxes have the issue of the lid coming off or shifting unless taped.I plan to use these for some older books I have in storage. And once the boxes are unloaded, they fold back into a stack and can be re-used again. This compares favorably to normal boxes that require taping because the folded empty boxes travel together easily as a stack. (To do that with normal boxes, one would have to cut open the tapes at the bottom.)2. However, having these boxes is a BIG step up from trying to steal boxes from grocery stores or used moving boxes (though maybe not as economically friendly). The boxes held a lot more than the storage bins and stacked up nicely in my walk-in closet, taking up about half the room of storage bins. All in all, I enjoyed what these boxes brought to the table. They're not sharp like other boxes can be when you lift them. The boxes seem secure, even without tape.I can't find any negatives about this product because I found that it did it's job, and, for me, did its job right! The boxes are really easy to set up and use without any tape. These boxes are very strong and sturdy - not ordinary boxes. I used these boxes for crating up books for my classroom. All I really have to do to get boxes from Amazon is to order a few pieces of glassware. These are great boxes. These boxes are just terrific. These boxes have been a life saver for me. If I didn't have these boxes, I'd have been in trouble, the boxes are made of good cardboard that doesnt have saw powder stuck on it. Something negative about these boxes? These Fellowes Large "Smooth Move" moving boxes are (18" High  x 25" Wide x 18" Depth) - 25" wide if you measure from the outside edge to the outside edge.Yes, fairly sturdy corrugated cardboard walls, double walled for the side panels. But overall I would say these boxes are pretty decent. I have seen cheaper boxes but they are of a thinner cardboard and singular wall construction (no double sides)So, for those in a rush ... these boxes pass "The Professor's" test. I obtained the Fellowes boxes (and I got the medium and small and will include this review with both) as I prepared to move homes across two states and a long stretch of patience. These boxes will be the only one I keep after I'm done with my move. These boxes are expensive, I can purchase 20 medium (though slightly smaller) sized boxes from a warehouse store for the same price and to be honest that's what I will do for the vast majority of the boxes I need (168 according to a moving company quote YIKES). However these are definitely the Cadillac of moving boxes as another reviewer noted, they are strong, sturdy, and ever so easy and quick to open up and seal back up all without that darn tape which is forever getting stuck on itself. These are moving boxes, and very nice ones! For other moving boxes, I still need to do some flipping work to convert them into box form. These boxes are fabulous. These boxes work out great. If I ever need boxes again for moving, these will definitely be my #1 choice. I was immediately impressed with how easy these boxes are to use. The boxes come flattened, but they open up in such a way that you don't need to tape together the bottom of the box. The boxes probably can handle much more weight, but I want to keep it manageable for myself.The lids of the boxes have two flaps that fold into the handle holes to keep the lid closed.

I was really impressed with these boxes.

I was pleasantly surprised when I found how different these boxes were, and I immediately saw some great benefits depending on what you were using them for.Well, these Moving Boxes are NOT Banker's Boxes, and while I think Banker's Boxes excel at the purpose of STORAGE, I think these boxes truly are dedicated to the singular task of MOVING your possessions.Here is a comparison of the two styles:The Banker's Boxes were 16 inches long, 13 inches wide, and 10 inches high.The Moving Boxes were 17 inches long, 12.25 inches wide, and 12.5 inches high.The Banker's Boxes were not as tall, and were slightly shorter lengthwise.

@highlight

Therefore, two boxes on top of each other (long term) might not be quite as stable -especially since they are taller.In addition, because of this fold, and of the way they lock, Moving Boxes don't open quite as easily or quickly as Banker's Boxes -whose tops come off with the flick of a finger.However, the Moving Boxes really shone in a couple  of areas:1) Easy to make: They were SUPER easy to put together; a lot easier than Banker's Boxes, and you can save time using them (over Banker's Boxes) -especially with people who haven't put together boxes before.
