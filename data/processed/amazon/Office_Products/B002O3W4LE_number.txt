I settled for a completely "alien" number. We spoke and found out that she was porting the number to some where else. We've had the same number for over 15 years and wanted to keep it. ).Porting the number took about three days. Fortunately, my former VO IP number was able to be ported.If you have not picked this up yet, "porting" is the term that is used for transferring your current phone number to your Ooma.I would highly recommend that anyone considering an Ooma who does not live near a major city to call Ooma customer support at 1-888-711-6662 and check to see if they are able to assign a local phone number for you, and if not, if they would be able to port your existing phone number. Porting my number took just one week. I can't tell you the number of times my home has lost power (I'm in a bad service area and we loose power at least 4 times a year but rarely more than 20 days total in a given year) but my traditonal landline phones always keep working. Ooma for free only comes with Caller ID number (no name).Note: Caller ID with name outside of my contact list can sometimes be strange - it may say OOMA or the phone exchange city title.You can also select if you want Caller ID outgoing or not and the initial setup of what your Caller ID name will look like. When we setup our temporary number to begin with, the caller ID name was wrong, I guess it takes a few months, but when we ported our number it used that caller ID & so it was correct. I got a new number rather than port over the old one, but that was no big deal for me. I ported by AT&T; number over to Ooma with no problems at all. My number did stop working for a short period of time the day the porting took place, but calls were not lost.Pros:$40 / month savings provide a very quick ROINo more AT&T;!No more long distance chargesVoice quality is decent. They either go straight to VM or get "This number is no longer in service". I needed to port my number ASAP (so I could disconnect my cable service) so I couldn't wait.COMMENTSA service like OOMA is NOT free for them to operate. Porting my old number went without a hitch.

(this was before my number port)-Telo device causes interference to any speakers within a couple of feet.

I got to select online what I call a 'temporary local number' (until I ported my landline number a month later).

FYI Caller ID outgoing will not show this virtual number even if you have two lines.
