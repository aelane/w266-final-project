"&#8213; Kurt VonnegutI need a document scanner to move fully paperless. Although it would slow document transmission down, it would be helpful to be able to share the scanner. A document scanner is a whole other world if all you have used is regular scanners before. I accidentally had scanned a document double-sided when it was single-sided, so I just deleted out the blank pages, rather than rescanning. But, this is a document scanner first and for most. You can choose the document size, or have the software determine the size as it scans. The document trays can both be folded down while not in use, saving precious desktop space. The Epson DS 510 is a document scanner that scans 26 pages per minute.Size: This is a little larger than a loaf a bread and takes up less desk space than most scanners. The document names are limited in size for some reason and you can't put super long names on your scanned files from the included epson software.Overall,  the Epson DS-510 scanner is excellent for workplace and home office projects because it is fast and very good quality.

I have used document scanners since before they were common place.

The document guides are easy to grasp and slide smoothly.

The document catch tray slides out of the bottom of the scanner and optionally has a flip up piece to help control longer documents.
