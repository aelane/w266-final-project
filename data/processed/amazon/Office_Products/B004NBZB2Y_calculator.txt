This has got to be the first calculator I've ever owned that I truly love. This calculator is perfect for what I need. This calculator is 100% by far the best scientific calc made by Ti ever.Hope this helps Maggie Alvarado says: "This is an awesome looking calculator. TI-36X Pro calculator (A non-graphing scientific calculator)I originally reviewed a TI-30XS Multi-View and a Casio FX-115ES when I took the Professional Engineer exam because they were the only ones available at the time that I could use without too much difficulty. So apparently the calculator does run on the CR2032 battery and utilizes some assistance from the solar cells.I am not a big fan of the hard case, as it clips at the bottom and top. You then turn off the calculator. When you turn the calculator back on, you can scroll up and find that calculation saved, results and all. On this calculator, Texas Instruments (the manufacturer of the TI) decided to put in a peculiar take on multi-purpose buttons. Really nice scientific calculator. The TI36 PRO calculator is a solid built calculator that will, I'm sure last as long as my TI 30 which I bought 30 years ago and still works, it even has the original battery :)As for the silver buttons that everyone keeps complaining about, yes it is a design flaw and TI should have known better. It's a calculator what can I say - it adds, subtracts, everything I need for the FE exam.
