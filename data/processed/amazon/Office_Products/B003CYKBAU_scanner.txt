The DS-600 scanner is a super light-weight scanner that barely takes up any room on your desk. The DSmobile scanner comes with two 4x6  sleeves which besides telling that you should clean them, are never described (I'm assuming you should use them to scan photos as that's how I used them). The scanner's options and ability to customize also aren't documented. If you want a scanner that doesn't take up a lot of room and does exactly what it should, check out the DS-600. Obviously, if you're using a mobile scanner, you're in a hurry. Overall, this is a very nice scanner. I've used this scanner to scan documents for work, as well as pictures and drawings. I returned this scanner after one use, and I believe that the one I received had some defects.Installation was fairly easy. My scanner was slow to power up and sometimes the button did not seem to respond, but I believe that's due to a defect.- You can only feed ONE page at a time. The scanner seems to have an especially difficult time with folds and starts pulling through one side of the page quicker than the other.- Most documents do not feed through straight since there is nothing guiding them- Anything you scan has to be clearly printed with dark ink. This scanner does not really detect lighter ink, faded lettering, etc.
