Very quick, even with color and the resolution is unbelievable. )It is also very stylish in rich, black color that is an eye-pleaser.It uses four small cartridges that were easy to install. Printing/Copying double-sided, color, pictures, etc, works well and come out clear. However, it's monochrome only (color laser printers are quite expensive). The color display is crisp and the touchscreen is accurate and trouble free.7. Though the color photos are not, of course, as vivid as color laser output (the best color laser I ever had was an Okidata, but the replacement toner was outrageous), they are quite good.One of the cool features of this product is the inability to directly email the printer. Best of all, the color printing is sharp and vibrant. I like that the color cartridges are separate because I mainly use black and keep color printing to a minimum so I can be frugal  in how much color I use or don't use on projects. Setup was easy, great color touchscreen, fast printing, the duplex printing is a great feature, excellent printing output with great colors, and the ability to print from smartphones and tablets.If you are looking for a quality all-in-one printer, this should be on the short list of choices. Exceptionally nice color, quick printing for an inkjet and the quality of prints are the best. )High Capacity - 126 three color multi-pack =Epson Durabrite Ultra Ink, Color Multi-pack (T126520)High Capacity - 126 Black  =Epson Durabrite Ultra Ink, Black (T127120)High Capacity - 126 Black - Dual Pack =EPSON Durabrite Ultra High Capacity Ink Cartridge, Black Ink Dual Pack (T126120-D2)Ultra High Capacity - 127 three color =Epson Durabrite Ultra Ink, Color Multi-pack (CMY) (T127520)Ultra High Capacity - 127 Black =Epson Durabrite Ultra Ink, Black (T127120)Ultra High Capacity - 127 Black - Dual Pack =EPSON Durabrite Ultra Extra High Capacity Ink Cartridge, Black Ink Dual Pack (T127120-D2)I very highly recommend the Epson WorkForce WF-3540 - for home or business, students and professionals alike as you simply won't go wrong with this machine! It's FAST - much faster than any color inkjet I've used before; the printing is clear; it looks nice; and it has a relatively small footprint. Even if you select Black/Grayscale, some color ink is still being used. This color photo printer features automatic two-sided printing, prints at a speed of three seconds per page, and stores up to 100 numbers in its speed dial directory.The main paper feeder holds 500 sheets so you do not have to reload as often as other models and makes. Epson's WF (as in WonderFul) color printer was a simple to set up thing. Adding a color image to your document really benefits from the premium inkjet paper, as color prints are underwhelming using plain copy paper.Photo print quality is quite acceptable using premium photo paper, but this printer is not designed to be a top quality photo printer.

I don't need color so I change the setting to black and white, but again am prompted to replace the color ink cartridges.

That is to say, I cannot print in black and white until I replace the color ink cartridges.

I haven't done any color printing to speak of so I won't comment on that.
