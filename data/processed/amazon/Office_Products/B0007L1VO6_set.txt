The Bic Mark-It Collection Permanent Marker set has lasted through several months of use during the previous school year and will begin the current school year as they are still going strong. This set allows for that and then some.What I really like about this set is the plastic clamshell packaging- it is not intended as a throw away and it unfolds to beautifully display this veritable rainbow while you work/create.I have always used Sharpie ultra fines for my tags, but these, with a lighter hand in writing, can manage an ultra fine line all the way over to broad (if holding them at a lower angle to the paper)... With this versatility I am considering finally retiring my big drawer of mismatched crappy markers with this sweet neat set.The little rubbery grip just below the cap line, is a nice feature and the thickness and slight tapering of the barrel feel better than my old sharpie ultra fines...All in all I think this is a fantastic set of versatile markers in more colors than I will ever need, or use, but the variety is perfect, especially as an artist and also for school project use by my son (never underestimate the variety desired by a child who recently discovered markers after a lifetime of the crayola big box! I love this set of markers - it has every color you could possible need, and the packaging is reusable so they are easy to carry around. This set contains 36 assorted colors. I really like this set a lot. What a great set of markers! The set includes 36 colors that run the gamut of intense and bold, to subtle and pale. For me, however, this set is fantastic because the variety of hues is inspiring! Because I've been using the set for only a week, I cannot comment on its longevity or how the markers demonstrate that the ink is depleted. It's a great set that I use every day. I've had a set of these for a long time and I adore them. This set is fantastic. This is a nice, affordable set which can be used in a variety of ways. I think you would be hardpressed to find a better set of markers anywhere. I am buying another set for my son who teaches school in Virginia (feel he could make good use of this set as well in his day to day job). It is really a handy set to have. The pen set I was going to buy was over $65, but I saw these and was happy to try them. I think this set would be nice for kids too, to draw with on different paper materials (hopefully not your walls! Great set of colors but 3 of them were just about dried out, I've sent a letter to Bic to see if they will replace them. This set is nice because of the array of colors it provides and the carrying case allows for easy storage. This set of 36 colors of permanent markers and the packaging is excellently set up to make it easy to open and store the markers.

I ended up buying both this BIC set with basic colors and a Sharpie set that had a wider variety of colors.

I bought this set because I thought it had a nice range of softer colors, especially those that look like they could be used for skin tones.

I'm going to have to buy another set for that.
