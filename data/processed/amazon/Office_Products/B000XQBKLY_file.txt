If you need some file folders, these are a nice choice. Not because I'm ECSTATIC about file folders, but because I have no complaints regarding their form or function. There are colorful tabbed file folders, made of stiff cardboard and of reasonable quality. These file folders can make any drab file drawer of manila folders look like a rainbow of colors. If it were, the file folder might not fit in the drawer! They just won't work any better than regular (non-SuperTab) file folders, and I certainly would not pay a premium for these. I needed some file folders to organize my desk drawers better. I have been using file folders for a long time. This will really assist in being able to find the right file faster. However, if you plan on inserting these into larger file folders, the extra tab space will impede the standard tabs on file folders. These file folders are fine. Also, since my file storage system is clear, the colors work well -- I like that you can see them, so you're not looking at plain, boring manilla folders.Within each color, there's a variation on tabbing (left, right, center), so you're not stuck with all the green folders having left tabs, all they yellow ones having right, etc.Good purchase for your home office. They are SMALLER than standard file folders.The tabs are about 4 x 1 inches (as compared to about 3 3/4 x 1/2 inches.) Made in the USA and a sturdy file folder.
