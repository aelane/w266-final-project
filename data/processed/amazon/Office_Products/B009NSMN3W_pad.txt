I've used the SimpleSort pad for about a month and it seems pretty useful. Perhaps Ampad will produce these if the basic pad takes off. To me this pad is revolutionary and brilliant. Right now it is $11 for a single pad of 80 sheets. This pad is not twelve times better than any other pad of paper. One 80-sheet pad is nearly as expensive as the entire original package, and to purchase the equivalent of a ream of 500 sheets would cost over $35.00 at current pricing on Amazon. Overall, this pad is a nice idea, but not so novel or convenient that I find it compelling to own, let alone spending very much for replacement sheets of paper. Also, this pad is not designed to hold much more than the 80 sheets included with it. This is not that pad. I like this pad for the concept, but not for the price. The pad is sturdy enough to walk around with, I didn't need an additional clipboard underneath for support. (No putting it back in the pad after that!) This is a handy pad that easily clips open at the top to install and remove more pads and move dividers around. It is much more sturdy than a standard legal pad which makes it great to take notes on if you are moving around and don't have great surfaces to write on. The pad includes several dividers, so it can be set up like a binder, but with far less bulk. This pad also allows you to add dividers and of course refill with new paper.If you prefer notebooks to binders, then this is a product for you. This is like a legal pad, except the cardboard back is strong enough to write on, so no clipboard necessary. It's must easier (and must less expensive) to have a legal pad with some dividers to section off your notebook. When I saw this pad I thought fantastic idea, that it would be great for work and I'd be able to take notes on the different projects I have going with the handy dividers. I don't know what I was expecting... it's basically a pad of paper with a clipboard built in.I've used it for several meetings, and I have flipped between the tabs and such, and that was a nice feature in a pad rather than a binder.Other than that, nice function, but you still rip off pages, or flip them over the top. I think a regular pad with post-it type tabs is preferable.

This pad has a plastic holder running along its top, which can be popped open in order to add/remove pages.

The pad is actually 80 separate sheets of college-ruled paper.

This pad will substantially reduce the latter and increase the quality of the former.What else can you possibly want?
