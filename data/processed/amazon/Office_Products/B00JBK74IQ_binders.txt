These binders are better for teens and adults. This isn't as sexy as a Trapper Keeper, but then again, few binders are. I was sold on D-Ring binders a couple years ago. I have encountered binders that have closures that do not close evenly and that makes for hard-to-turn pages and eventual tearing of the pages. I'm always using binders for classes and coursework, and while the 1 inch binders are fairly slim, they do hold a fair amount of pages (about 200-250, which is more than the average 1 inch binder).The Mead binders are a good quality. In many binders, this can be loose, even flimsy. These are sturdy, mostly well-made binders. I have used many D-Ring binders and these do not live up to the quality that I am used to. If you are looking for simple utilitarian binders that won't rip pages as they are flipped, these will do the trick!Nice mat finish on front, back, binder and inside pockets. I use these binders for keep my genealogical research organized and use a different binder for each part of my family tree. Mead really does make good binders. This may be true of almost all binders, that when you get the 1 inch size they also cut down the width of the binder, but you need to know when choosing a binder for your project. So if you are contemplating these binders, I would say buy one and see how you like it before you commit to buying a bunch of them. One can never have too many binders, right? The binders are  brightly colored and are very durable. These are decent binders although not at all worth the retail price of $29.94. These are the best binders for the job If you are rough with binders, this one may not be heavy duty enough. These durable binders come in a color I don't ever think I've seen before as a binder color: sky blue. The binders are handled by children and adults and stand up to heavy use. These are great binders. So she not only needs binders that are useful and protective, but also durable over the long-term. I use binders to hold pocketed folders, and clear page protectors filled with patterns and magazine clippings. These binders are nice basic binders. The binders are probably a &#34;better&#34; binder (going by a good, better, best rating scale).
