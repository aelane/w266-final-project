It slides easily under the desk and can be put there after the use. I installed this on a secondary desk in my office (the primary desk has a center drawer making it impossible to install an aftermarket keyboard tray). Don't mistake thisFellowes Professional Series Executive Keyboard Tray (8036101)for just another under the desk keyboard drawer, as it's far better than that. If your desk has a front lip underneath (mine did not), then you may wish to measure and cut a piece of plywood on which the track is to be mounted before you begin.When first unpacking the keyboard tray, look for the instruction sheet for assembly and installation. My desk was plenty deep enough to accommodate the tray and mouse stand, but I can see how smaller (and especially less deep) desks would present a problem.I use a standard width keyboard, so the width issue didn't effect me, but if it's a problem for you, there removable brackets on the side of the keyboard stand that can be removed to accommodate a wider unit.The keyboard tray moves up and down easily and the tilt control (which only lets you tilt back) is a slider just behind the tray. My current desk is so not worthy of this unexpected amazing unit. If you are at your desk a lot, you owe it to yourself to make this small investment. Also, if you have a fancy desk with a deep bull-nose you are not going to be able to attach the tray.That said, if you have an armoire setup like mine, you'll find installation is a breeze and the tray is sturdy and looks professionally awesome. Let me explain.Currently, my desk is a beautiful, hand crafted cherry table.

My desk is a little deeper than that, but there is wood towards the front and back, so I do not have 22 inches of flat surface on the underside of my desk from front to back.There is another problem.

My desk has a front lip.

If the desk does not have a lip, the tray can be adjusted upward.WHAT KIND OF KEYBOARD?I have several keyboards.
