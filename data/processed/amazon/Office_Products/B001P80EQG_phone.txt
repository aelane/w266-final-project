This phone has changed my life. This phone system is ALSO an intercom system----PLUS you can even put a called on hold and then intercom another person to pick up the call on the phone in his/her room.3. So if you have a phone in the baby's room, for instance, you could set the phone in baby's room to not ring at night.7. You can switch between regular phone and speakerphone on any call, back and forth as much as you need. You only need one phone jack for this entire system, the satellite phones only need the AC charger plugged into the wall. IF you can identify which phone is low (maybe there is one you use the most? You will still have to charge them when you insert them in the phone, however and the phone will still tell you to charge then for 7 hours, however you CAN use your phone during the charging phase.If you were not able to reset the phone book before replacing the batteries, try another reset after replacing them, by unplugging and replugging in the base station, and hopefully this will resolve the disappearing phone book problem. With this 5 phone system, that scratching on the nails yelling has stopped: with 5 phones chances are there's one in plain sight of the person looking for a phone.PROS- NO ANTENNA...this phone is compact and has no protruding antenna which makes it very nice- TALKING CALLER ID...this phone speaks the name of the callerID whenever a call comes in which can be very nice. The phone comes with and uses AAA rechargeable batteries. Fresh phone with fresh batterly life. This phone solves that problem. I keep a regular phone in my kitchen and if someone calls, the ringing is loud enough to wake me up in my bedroom but not so much that I get yanked out of sleep. This makes the phone highly useful at night.- YOU ONLY NEED ONE PHONE PORT...this phone plugs into one line jack and from there you get 5 phones (6 if you buy the expansion set).- SPEAKERPHONE...each handset is a speakerphone and the base unit is also a speakerphone complete with keypad (it's like having 5 phones and 1 base speakerphone)- INTERCOM...the intercom feature is nice. Each phone has a number and you can page any phone from any other phone. Also if you should happen to lose a phone in the house, you can use the intercom feature as a location device.....page each phone individually until you've found them all.- LIGHT...these phones are very light and compact. So I have to wipe the phone. Very minor but thought I'd mention.- BASE CENTRIC...if any one phone is in use, you can't add phone numbers or check voicemail or do anything else with any of the other phones in the house. Because this phone doesn't get loud enough I am back to wearing my earphone and it hurts my ears. Especially on the latter phone the interference had been terrible, even through just one wall or floor. Initially I had started to designate one particular phone for each base location (for paging from other sites) but quickly realized that the phones were being swapped for one another so the paging feature has little use for us (but no fault of the phone, of course). It was a 3 phone set. One phone overheats, one has a faulty circuit which makes the phone shut off at will.I am buying this set of phones because I have a similar set at work.I bought the work phones from Amazon and all those other phones that I had trouble with from another store.Hopefully this will be the end of my phone trouble.S
