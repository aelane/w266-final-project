What more could you want in a notebook? This is a decent notebook. This notebook is almost perfect. The notebook is a bit more than I would pay if I saw it on the shelf of a store... but it is a good notebook. This Five-Star notebook is a back-to-school item for my daughter, who is entering fifth grade in the fall.The notebook has a plastic cover that is durable (won't fall off in the winter). This notebook is one of my favorites. College ruled five subject notebook. This is a well-made notebook, which is what I would expect based on my experience with other &#34;Five Star&#34; notebooks I've used. This notebook is about as tough as it gets. This notebook even has a stronger (though not indestructible) wire spine.If you just need an inexpensive normal notebook with no separators, etc., you can get one much cheaper than this one. But this notebook is not expensive given what you get. This is the notebook which can hold it. This is such a nice notebook, particularly for middle school on up. If you're looking for a nice, long-lasting, quality notebook with tons of room to write in, this notebook is for you! This 5 subject notebook is fabulous for students. Great notebook with quality paper. Overall this is a great notebook to carry from class to class. This is a nice notebook for organizing  your various classes. The notebook I received was black and the cover is really nice. This is the same notebook I used when I was in college. Before I had the notebook, I had different pieces of paper all in a large envelope. I love my notebook and the cover can be wiped down and it won't get ruined. This notebook is made to be durable going in and out of backpacks for class and study sessions for an entire semester--for all your classes. That being said, this five subject notebook is pretty good.The pros:- All or most of your class notes for the semester in one place- It's sturdy and won't come apart in your backpack- The folder pockets double as dividers and they don't tear easily at the edges- You can tear out pages using the perforations or have the rough edgesThe cons:- This is not a light notebook and it only gets heavier the more you put in it- The folders only hold so much, and it's probably not enough if you have teachers who love to give handouts- Pages are a bit thin, so depending on pen type, you may get bleeding- The perforations don't always make removing pages easy, though they should.I guess, looking at it that way, each feature has good and bad aspects. I've always kept a notebook here and this will last, well, years. Nice notebook with strong front cover, wont come loose/fall off with use. This is a nice durable notebook, not too heavy or bulky and it contains five divided sections. The notebook can certainly stand up to rugged use.My second impression came from the weight. The notebook is heavy. I definitely think that this notebook is perfect for the high school/college student. He/She can separate the notebook by subject and slip the syllabus or any other sheets into the folders in front of the subject. This notebook has everything you could want:  lots of pages, a big spiral ring to make the pages easy to turn, a heavy duty back cover and a durable plastic front cover. this notebook is HUGE! This 5-subject notebook has a heavy, water-resistant cover, and the pockets between each section are very sturdy. This notebook is an AWESOME deal when you buy it here on Amazon! This is a good notebook for classes or for general purpose.

This is a hefty 5-subject notebook but the paper feels rough and the edges of the 3-holes are jagged.

This is the nicest spiral notebook I've ever seen and simply because it has so many sheets of paper it's fairly heavy, so I wouldn't recommend this is you are going to be needing a notebook to carry around with you a lot.

This, college-ruled, notebook is over an inch thick.
