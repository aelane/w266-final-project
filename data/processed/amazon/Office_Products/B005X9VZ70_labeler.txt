The Dymo labeler is similar in features, use, and end result to P-Touch products. It is a good labeler for putting words on a label!Pros:-nice size with pretty big letter keys-easy access to font size, sideways text, and text modifiers-easier access to foreign letter accents than many labelers I've seen-quick to startup and quick to print-lots of label options-remembers what you last printed when turned off and on-the label maker doesn't waste as much tape as some (not as much waste on both sides of what you print)expected cons: (These are cons but what I would expect for an inexpensive label maker)-6 AAA batteries not included, can use power cord but not included-the screen doesn't show text size. A labeler is something I use about once a month at best. The DYMO LabelManager 160 is a portable, lightweight, and compact labeler. Not so with this labeler; it doesn't waste any tape.- Economical Label RefillsSome of the DYMO label available are1/2" x 13' Black on White, Black on Clear, Black on Red, Black on Yellow,3/8"x23' Black on White, Black on Clear, Blue on White, Red on Whitew,1/4"x23' Black on White. If you need a handheld labeler that prints barcodes, consider the DYMO 420P.---The DYMO meets most of my labeling needs. We are now more organized (our other labeler, a P Touch, had broken). I love this labeler.

The only labeler I've used before is the Brother P-Touch.

This labeler is simple and works well for the price.

I like this labeler, it works great--but it's still not for me.
