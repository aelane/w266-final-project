This binder is a great choice for older students and adults but for elementary ages students I recommend the Wilson Jones Ultra Duty binder because it's much easier to open. This binder can take a hit! Whether you want to spend this much on an individual binder will probably depend on your priorities (if you need a lot of them, for instance), but overall this is a good quality organization tool. I really like the D-ring of this binder because it prevents papers from getting stuck underneath the rings in either the front or the back of the binder when you are trying to pack in a lot in one binder. It's a binder, right. So I need a good binder to hold them. This binder does not have that problem. This is a nice sturdy binder featuring D rings that close securely. You want a binder that is easy to use, but not flimsy. This binder fits these needs. This is a really good binder. I hate when you get a binder and the hinges are slightly misaligned or have gaps, and every time you try to move paper in the binder it snags, rips, etc. Looking closely at the binder, it appears to be no better that some $2.50 binders I have. I do prefer the &#34;D&#34; ring binder over the conventional ring binders that I paid $2.50 for. I'll work with the binder and see if I can discern any advantages it has other than the &#34;D&#34; ring and if I do, I'll update my review. This is good basic binder in a pretty classic style. This particular binder has only one pocket on the inside of the front and back cover, as opposed to two. I am very happy with this binder. I would recommend this binder. This binder is flimsy and has a very cheap feel and look to it. I like this eco-friendly binder. This is a nice, sturdy binder that seems to be constructed well. If this binder is going to be used frequently, I'd pass on this one. It's still a good binder and still usable but worth mentioning. This binder has some really nice features. The binder is a view binder with clear view covers not only on the front but the spine and the back as well. This is a cheap, flimsy binder. .... until I've used this binder for at least a semester.I'm a part-time instructor at a two-year college, and yes, I still keep a pen and paper class record book as a backup record for grades and attendance. I selected this binder for use as a class record book starting in the fall semester, but because of deadlines imposed by the Amazon Vine program I must give my first impressions now that it has just arrived.First, this binder's D-rings are a good idea. My current binder for class records also has a D-ring, and I intend to stay with D-rings because they are more durable and more problem-free than O-rings.Second, I like a binder with views like this so that I can create front covers myself for class records and for lecture notes. This binder would be fine on a shop floor but isn't suited to presentations or school work. This is a durable binder with great features. The binder has thick plastic in the hinges, which should make it last longer.Overall, the binder looks sturdy and durable. This will be a good binder for situation where you need a sturdy binder but will not need to open and close it often. Yes, I can get excited about a binder. Great binder. This seems like a pretty average binder. Also, be aware that this binder has the front and back cover outside pockets so you can label them with a slip of paper, which is nice.Yeah, I'd have to say this is a perfectly reasonable binder, even if I do miss the double pockets. Anyway, this is a fine enough binder, so give it a try if you like! I will use this binder to store documents that are not needed regularly. This binder uses D clips rather than the usual round clips which I think do a better job of holding the contents and not allowing them to get &#34;stuck&#34; on either end of the binder. It's a relatively small binder so it's best for smaller projects of less than 200 pages. The binder's cover is stiff, and hinges feel solid. I was hoping that this binder would be better than the other Wilson Jones binder I selected because it was heavy duty. My red binder is for storing critical documents that need my immediate attention.My red binder is gorgeous. A one-inch binder with D-Rings can store more pages than a one-inch binder with traditional round rings. Furthermore, when dropped, a D-Ring binder is less likely to bust open and spill its contents than a binder with round rings.In order to open the binder, one must press down hard on both metal tabs located at the end of the spine. This is a great binder. It's a pretty generic three ring binder. This is a very nice binder. This binder has D-rings that hold up to 250 sheets of paper, and it supposedly will last ten times longer than a comparable binder made of vinyl. It appears to be a sturdy binder which has good interior pockets and easy to operate hinges. The Wilson Jones Heavy Duty D-Ring binder is a simple, solid binder. The binder is stiff and seems to be holding up to normal wear and tear. This binder isn't fancy by any means, but it functions well, the rings snap open smoothly, and it holds my papers efficiently. This is a wonderful binder, I'm using it for my personal photos project.The front and back are covered in plastic that I can slide photos I've taken into the front and back covers and several pages on the inside, featuring my photographs.It's a really nice and well built binder and I'm really happy with it.There a plastic pockets on the inside that would nicely hold pens, pencils, etc.Good binder! This is a standard D-ring binder of good quality. This binder gave me a solid and visually attractive way to store copies in the church office for anyone to look at. This is a nice binder. This appears to be a well-made binder that will hold up well. This binder is perfect for me to organize all my bills past (due) and present. If you are looking for a binder that will not only last but will hold up then look no further. This Wilson Jones 'Heavy Duty' D-ring binder is your standard sort of school binder and I end up purchasing 3-4 of them every year for my kids. The white binder is constructed the same and the color is white without being blindingly white, nor the purest white. My previous binder was falling apart at the edges so I needed a new one. All that said, I really do like this binder. The binder itself feels solid and durable. This particular binder, the Wilson Jones Heavy Duty D-Ring View Binder with Extra Durable Hinge, 1-Inch, is better than the Wilson Jones Ultra Duty Round Ring View Binder with Extra Durable Hinge, 2-Inch and about the same as the Wilson Jones Heavy Duty D-Ring View Binder with Extra Durable Hinge, 1 1/2-Inch. This binder, on the other hand, offers standard sizing, bland cover material, and a sturdy D-ring that holds 250 sheets. It&#8217;s a good but undistinguished binder at too high a price. Solid binder at a slightly high price point. This is a nicely designed binder with a few features not found in generic binders. To personalize the binder , clear plastic sleeves allow the user to insert full size pictures to make a statement. Standard 3 ring binder with 2 inside pockets which I find are too shallow for heavier stack of papers. This very sturdy binder is only an inch thick, but will hold 250 sheets of paper thanks to its having D-rings instead of the usual O-rings. This is a traditional hard binder that has easy-to use rings and looks to be able to stand up to lots and lots of abuse. I wouldn't bet on that but this binder does seem to be a bit better quality than many others out there on the market. Time will tell but I'd be surprised if these lasted much longer than any other binder out there. I am a binder freak. For them, I have found that a flexible binder in general will make it farther though the school year. However, the binder looks cheap, the cover being wrinkled. When open, the binder lays flat. You can be customize the binder by inserting photos, printout, artwork, etc.T
