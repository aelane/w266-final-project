I was surprised how cleanly these cards separate. I printed the cards up and only had to adjust the alignment a little.This great product should help save money on pro-business cards and might bring calling cards back in style (OK, maybe not-lol). While I normally have my professional cards printed professionally in larger amounts, I enjoy being able to occasionally print up a few "specific" business cards, and I always keep a few around to use.So, when I was given the chance to try this particular card - the new Clean-Edge cards, I was excited.The cards say they are for "inkjet printers" and I know that the heat and pass-through path can be a problem on laser printers, but I thought I'd try using the laser as well. While not as heavy as my professionally printed cards, they are well within the range.I also passed them through my inkjet to make sure there was no problem. These blank cards gave me a clean sharp edge and didn't jam my printer. 10 cards to a page, so a total or 8 sheets in a package. These are great cards. Avery Clean- Edge Business cards have proven to be a good business card for this purpose.So, what are the advantages with Avery Clean Edge Business Cards? You bend the cards and they snap apart with ease. Then these cards could just be what you need.I had no problems setting up the cards to print. Do not tear the cards apart when you are done. The resulting cards have no perforations and the edges are totally clean - impossible to tell your own printed cards from ones that are professionally prepared.Avery has Word templates available for download or by going to [...] it is possible to design your cards with the help of their Avery Design site. I prefer to design my own cards with graphics apps, but having this service available as a no-cost option will be helpful to some.This is an excellent quality product - highly recommended. The cards look great and the instructions are simple, but if I'm looking for new business cards, I'm going to go one of two ways. These cards are fairly easy to use and nice quality (thick and smooth, nice bright white). These are the perfect lightweight cards for use in your average home printer. The cards separate easily from each other yet do not fall part in the printer during the printing process. Sometimes the cards don't come apart clean and it pulls up a little feather of paper on the edge ruining that card. They should take ink very well, and you'll be able to make some decent-looking cards with them if you know what you are doing. These blank cards work hand-in-glove with design templates that you download for free from Avery's website. However, Avery cards turned to be quite something else. So, I used these cards to make up some "calling cards". Most of the cards looked very nice. The only cards I printed which had results that I believe would be equally unsatisfactory on other printers (or this one with better ink) were those with full- card photographic backgrounds. On those cards, the amount of ink used resulted in somewhat warped cards. I've used cards like this in the past, which. I've had many cards printed on line and professional printers will outdo what you will likely do on a $100 ink jet. I like my cards just so. These cards are great!. The cards look like they were printed by a professional print shop rather than at home. They are basic smooth white cards - no special embossed textured look. These cards can help. You don't rip or cut or tear these cards apart, you print them, and snap them apart. Out came some beautiful cards. Now, these cards aren't going to have a sharp edge, like a professionally made card, they will have a soft edge. I always wanted to have some personal calling cards that had the style and quality of business cards. The cards literally pop right out of the sheet with perfectly straight edges. Anytime I need to print some cards, I just open up the file & print the cards. The Avery cards break apart clean, they look professional, and are perfect when a set of cards are needed in a hurry. It's not really cost effective to print several thousand cards using these.Very handy product! I guess if you need a some cards quickly this is for you. These cards are are a great size. The cards are a little thinner than normal but that's probably so that it fits and feeds through your printer properly. I knew the Clean Edge cards printed well and more importantly, separated cleanly (I'm still amazed how clean and sharp the edges are for a preforated sheet). These cards are relatively expensive. I have used these cards many times and find that there is nothing competitive in the market.Pros:* The "clean edge" system for breaking up the printed cards into separate pieces is without equal. The cards break so perfectly that they look like they were cut apart instead of perforated. * These cards take ink really well and print nicely. The cards themselves easily snapped apart, and left absolutely no rough edges. They came out exactly as I would expect professional cards to look, with the exception of the "flatness" of the ink. There isn't too much to say about these cards except that they are great! There are both blank cards and ones with designs available, for all types of businesses. With Digital Image, you can also choose cards that have designs, or are blank so you can add a picture. The cards are beautiful, though not glossy, and easily separate by folding. The cards can be printed on BOTH sides, and each side of the sheet have arrows to show how to insert them into the printer, so you never make a mistake. I prefer glossy finished cards, but the colors come out looking nice and vivid on the matte finish, so this is just as good. I've printed cards up with calendars on one side and clients tend to keep these in their wallets, keeping your company's name in view every time someone looks at a calendar date. If they would make the cards thicker, they would look completely professional and this would make the product perfect! These cards are going to be largely what you make of them -- Do a nice job designing the your card and you'll get a nice card. The cards came out nicely centered on the card stock and the printing and picture is crisp and clean. There is also templates so you can design your own cards from scratch.I
