When I saw these tabs I thought they'd be a perfect solution for this. And they were.The tabs are small two-sided squares. These tabs are as reusable as they claim to be!Bottom line: If you want something that will support the weight of about one sheet of paper, will stick without leaving a residue or messing up paint, and can be reused, this is the product for you and is worth every penny. I used about 16 of these adhesive tabs to hang a long greeting card on a dry, painted surface. It wasn't long before I noticed more than several of the tabs had come loose. These tabs are great for hanging light weight stuff. These tabs don't leave anything behind when you pull them off. The tabs are sticker than two sided tape. These 1/2" tabs were perfect for that purpose. I very much liked that the tabs are restickable so when I didn't get the photograph in exactly the right spot I was easily able to reposition it.Just for fun I tried resticking them on some other items several times to see how long they would retain their stickiness. These tabs are GREAT! I love these little tabs and their stick-to-it-ive-ness! The tabs, which measure roughly a quarter inch on each side, have liners on both sides. Scotch reusable tabs are ideal for sticking notes, photos, lists, and other light items to walls, refrigerators and other appliances, doors, windows, mirrors, and (basically) any smooth surface. Since the tabs are reusable, I can switch them from one poster to another with ease. However, it is good to know that the tabs can be gently washed with soapy water to refresh their stickiness. The clear tabs have a protective sheet on each side. The tabs remove easily from both the hanging surface and the items itself (I tested card stock, paper and photos) and leave absolutely no stickiness or residue. Also, the tabs are thicker than normal two sided tape, so the item you're hanging will not be flush against the wall, but rather slightly raised. I tried these tabs out on the walls, hanging various things to test them out and they performed flawlessly. I even used it to hang stuff up outside, using the tabs to stick signs to the fence, porch, and garbage bins.Unlike with so many of the other products I've tried, *not one thing* fell off during the bustling party, nor was there any damage to my walls or paint.One caveat -- while they are billed as reusable, storing them between use is a bit of a pain, as the container they come in isn't the greatest. I really like these reusable tabs. Unlike other two-sided sticky tabs I've tried, I found it easy to remove the seal on both sides of each tab. These tabs are pretty sweet but my main gripe with them is they are so small! Anyway, I spaced the tabs out along this route and VOILA! I happened across the Scotch Reusable Tabs on Amazon & found the perfect solution.These tabs are fairly thin and very easy to use. These reusable tabs seem like they'd be great for the office - home or work - but they fail in quite a spectacular fashion. I'll use these tabs from here on out. Tried these scotch tabs upon every surface I could think of ranging from paint, wood, metal and glass and they all sucessfully passed my residue test even after a few days of leaving on. The tabs are designed for lightweight mounting with double-sided adhesive for securing objects for hanging artwork, photos, party streamers, greeting cards and other light weight objects. The tabs can be used on most flat surfaces: Stainless steel, plastic, concrete, glass, wood, and painted walls.Another Wonderful Innovation by Scotch Brand Tapes with dozens of possible uses. These little sticky tabs peel off the plastic sheet easily and adhere to most things. These are neat little adhesive tabs that allow you to "tape" a picture to a wall, or a card to wall, etc. The tabs are reusable, but you need to keep track of the pack to keep them together when not in use.We used these on a couple of foam core boards for a display for a memorial service and we were able to remove them from from the board and from the backs of the photos.I would recommend these to people who need a short term solution for displays. I used 6 tabs to mount a 12" square, thin metal "astronaut crossing sigh". The tabs kept the sign in place for about 12 hours. I added more tabs but it still fell off the wall. I was hoping the tabs would work for heavier than paper items. I just apply one of the tabs on the back of the object to be mounted and the press down on the board I'm mounting on. These tabs are quite small, and as I work small, that's totally OK w/ me. The tabs didn't remove the paint on the cd and they are still sticking to the door without falling off.Another use I found for them... We live next to a road and we have had problems of vibrations from traffic making our pictures shift. The tabs are just there to keep them from moving - they are NOT supporting the frames)To me, these tabs are worth their weight in gold - especially since they are reusable. If you need very small reusable tabs that don't damage.....you might try these.T
