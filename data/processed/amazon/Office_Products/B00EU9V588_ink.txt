The Claria Premium ink cartridges make a difference, and are more pigment stable, and the availability of a photo black cartridge makes a difference.The XP-610 has a small, squarish, laser printer like form factor. And, since the ink cartridges are fairly small, I know I better stock-up on ink in advance. Yes, we have bought genuine Epson ink and we cannot get it to print color stuff. (Be prepared to use up about 1/6 of the ink cartridge to do that chore.) Inserting ink cartridges was easy. Ink - There is no getting around it, if the ink for a machine is too expensive and/or it burns through it like mad, it simply is not worth buying the unit. The ink for this little guy (273 ink) runs about $13 for a single black cartridge and $41 for a 4 pack of the photo black and the colors ($10.25/ea) (Amazon Prime price). I feel the ink use is comparable to many other color printers I have own.The individual ink cartridges are convenient and seem like a must have with the cost of replacement cartridges today.The touch screen is easy to use. I was able to find generic compatable ink cartridges right here on Amazon, buying a 5 pack for $20. That is not bad for generic ink cartridges, but it is still about twice as expensive as the generic ink cartridges I have bought for my Brother printers for many years now. Just be careful if you decide to buy generic "compatible" ink cartridges that you read the customer reviews and stick to generic inks with a 4 star rating or better. I haven't used it enough yet to determine ink cartridge life and cost, though through experience I can tell you Epson does pretty well on the ink costs. I just wish the ink didn't cost so much! An ink clog problem resulted in my reliable Cannon printer breaking down. The ink is not cheap but it's about average for the cost of the cartridges. Apparently there's very little ink in each cartridge. The ink cartridges are small, so I think this printer is better suited to a relatively low volume use. Because we are printing so much, we purchased some extra ink, so we'll be prepared.Standard-capacity Color Multi-pack - Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Photo BlackEpson T273520 Epson Claria Premium 273 Standard-capacity Color Multi-pack - Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Photo Black (T273520) InkStandard-capacity Photo Black Ink Cartridge (this also comes in the Multi-pack)Epson T273120 Epson Claria Premium 273 Standard-capacity Photo Black Ink Cartridge (T273120) InkStandard-capacity Black Ink CartridgeEpson T273020 Epson Claria Premium 273 Standard-capacity Black Ink Cartridge (T273020) Ink The ink system is the problem. I can't tell you how many Epson ink cartridges I've thrown out because the printer they were for broke.Do yourself a favor, spend a more and buy a better (probably non-Epson) printer.

The individual ink cartridges do a great job on both plain and photo paper.

The ink cartridges come with caps rather than tape, so the cartridges can be removed from the printer and recapped if there is some reason you want to do that.

It is because the Epson ink is ridiculously expensive.
