The first one I bought, the shavings tray wouldn't stay closed. The shavings are very easy to dispose of; the plastic part on the front slides off so you can take the shavings to the garbage. However, the shavings trap is not firmly secured to the actual machine itself. It's relatively sturdy (considering it's mostly plastic), it sharpens well, and it's easy to clean out the shavings, with a tray that pulls out of the front. The shavings container is big and empties easily, however some spillage occurs from shavings stuck overhead in the gears. The shavings tray is easy to take out, empty, and slide back in. They also fill up with shavings quickly. While sharpening pencils the shavings reservoir seems to move a little bit like it doesn't stay firmly in place but the pencil shavings still stay inside the reservoir and it's not enough that would make you have to hold it (as I read in a previous review). It is easy to remove the shavings reservoir, but sometimes it seems like some of the shavings are trapped up by the blade which is covered with see through plastic. Easy to empty the shavings. The shavings reservoir is also huge compared to any sharpener I've ever owned. The shavings can be seen easily in the reservoir so its easy to see when it needs empting. The shavings reservoir is spacious and made of clear plastic so you can see how much is in there.
