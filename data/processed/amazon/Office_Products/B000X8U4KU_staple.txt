When I first got this staple remover I ripped the paper when I tried to pull a staple out of two pieces of paper. This Swingline staple remover gets that job done quickly and with minimum effort. But getting those staple back off will not be kind to one of those normal staple removers. This staple remover works completely differently. This is a sturdy staple remover made of chrome plated steel and a small part that actually gets under the staple and lifts it out that appears to be heat-treated steel, which is even stronger. This staple remover really isn't that great for removing staples from paper. This staple remover is perfect for that. This is an outstanding staple remover.

What can you say about this Swingline staple remover, except that it works exactly as you'd want it to.An easy to see and use black metal &#34;tongue&#34; slips under the staple.Then, by simply squeezing the handle, as you would a stapler, the &#34;tongue&#34;  easily lifts the staple free.This staple remover is sturdy, and well-designed so that it will rest on a desktop, ready for use.The handle that you use to do the squeezing, is thoughtfully-designed--broad enough to spread the force over your thumb or the palm of your hand without causing straining or fatigue, if you're doing a lot of staple- removing.I guess this was just a detailed way of saying:  &#34;It does very well exactly what it's supposed to do!&#34; I use a staple remover quite often to separate the documents before I feed them into the automatic document feeder (ADF) tray of my scanner. Before I acquired the Swingline staple remover, the pinch style staple remover was the only type of staple remover I had ever used.

I positioned the staple puller on the document, slipped the tongue under the staple, grasped the handle firmly and pressed down. This staple puller works well to pull them out.

Once it is under the staple when I squeeze the handle the paper  around the staple is torn and crumpled as the staple is removed.
