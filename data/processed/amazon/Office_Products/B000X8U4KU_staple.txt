When I first got this staple remover I ripped the paper when I tried to pull a staple out of two pieces of paper. This Swingline staple remover gets that job done quickly and with minimum effort. But getting those staple back off will not be kind to one of those normal staple removers. This staple remover works completely differently. This is a sturdy staple remover made of chrome plated steel and a small part that actually gets under the staple and lifts it out that appears to be heat-treated steel, which is even stronger. This staple remover really isn't that great for removing staples from paper. This staple remover is perfect for that. This is an outstanding staple remover. You may want to have the smaller staple remover for use by the copier, but this one you will want to keep on your desk because it will be used for removing staples from boxes, shipping cartons, and like I said earlier, wood. This staple remover looks like some arcane torture device from the dark ages. So, do use regular staple remover for light duty tasks.This product does what it claims. it only pulls on the staple, not the paper, leaving it pretty much intact besides the two tiny holes. Once you use these, you get spoiled and demand them when a staple needs removal. If you're looking for a staple remover for paper, this is not the tool. If you're just trying to pull a staple from some sheets of paper, use one of the small finger-squeeze staple pullers. But, it's still a good staple remover but between the two types, I would probably grab the fangs first. This staple remover is crafted of solid metal, and made to rock forward, pulling the staples from the surface to which they've been attached. I think I'll never go back to a standard staple remover again. What can you say about this Swingline staple remover, except that it works exactly as you'd want it to.An easy to see and use black metal &#34;tongue&#34; slips under the staple.Then, by simply squeezing the handle, as you would a stapler, the &#34;tongue&#34;  easily lifts the staple free.This staple remover is sturdy, and well-designed so that it will rest on a desktop, ready for use.The handle that you use to do the squeezing, is thoughtfully-designed--broad enough to spread the force over your thumb or the palm of your hand without causing straining or fatigue, if you're doing a lot of staple- removing.I guess this was just a detailed way of saying:  &#34;It does very well exactly what it's supposed to do!&#34; I use a staple remover quite often to separate the documents before I feed them into the automatic document feeder (ADF) tray of my scanner. Before I acquired the Swingline staple remover, the pinch style staple remover was the only type of staple remover I had ever used. It is not a HEAVY DUTY as in long lasting staple remover, but a remover for HEAVY DUTY STAPLES. This staple puller works perfectly to remove even heavy staples. I positioned the staple puller on the document, slipped the tongue under the staple, grasped the handle firmly and pressed down. This staple puller works well to pull them out. But if you must hold the staple remover and get at the staple that way, you will find a design flaw unless you have really huge hands. I don't like it.I'll stick with the old-fashioned staple remover. This is infinitely better than a regular hinge-type staple remover: it uses leverage instead of just picking the staple apart. It's both faster and more effective than a regular staple remover. I used to have one of those simple pinch-type staple removers, must have lost it. If you are considering this staple remover, just know that it is for truly heavy duty staples.Regarding the 4-star rating - if you have a ton of staples to remove from cardboard and that is your primary usage, you would probably give it 5 stars. It's easy to use and pulls the staple right out. This staple remover even works on upholstery staples in furniture- it's that strong.The grip is very comfortable and wide- but not too wide that a small hand can't handle it. The best staple remover I&#8217;ve ever used. I couldn&#8217;t believe how easy it was to use this staple remover. I find this staple remover difficult to use. Once it is under the staple when I squeeze the handle the paper  around the staple is torn and crumpled as the staple is removed. This staple remover is really big it takes up almost the same amount of space as my stapler.O
