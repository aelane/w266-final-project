We love this mouse pad. Love the large mouse pad. I would definitely recommend this as a great mouse pad. Even after optical mouse came out and everyone disregarded mouse pads as dirt accumulators, I stuck to my trusty mouse pad. The SteelSeries Qck mouse pad is just about the best cloth mouse pad I've ever used. This very large mouse pad works perfect, and I like that it has room for both my mouse and touch pad by my computer, so I don't have to move them around. My mouse is really flakey and only works on certain surfaces, but this pad was no issue. Gaming mouse pads usually are jumbo sized for those people who play video games on their PC. Thus, when you move your mouse, the mouse glides easily. For those who don't know, these are much better than the cheap-o $1 mouse pads you can sometimes get for free with advertisements from PC service centers. I decided on the SteelSeries QcK mouse pad as its replacement, but I was a bit wary cloth pads after having used a hard pad after so many years...Pros compared to Ratpad:+ Much smoother gliding, but sometimes I do miss the hard texture of the Ratpad.+ Nice and thin so it doesn't get in the way.Cons compared to the Ratpad:- Despite the rubbery bottom, QcK still slides a bit after a day or so of use. This is important to me because my mouse rests on a slide-out keyboard tray.- The cloth surface isn't as easy to clean.Overall, I would say that it's an excellent mouse pad if you want a cloth pad, but I miss the sturdiness of the Ratpad. This is an excellent mouse pad. It is large as mouse pads go. It does what a mouse pad is supposed to do and that is move the cursor without fail. My previous mouse pads would on occasion miss a beat or did not have proper contact with the pad. Cloth keeps my mouse from sticking and gives it smooth motion. If you also own the G9 mouse, I highly recommend getting this. This mouse pad comes rolled up which speaks to how thin it is. My other mouse pads were pitiful and small, hardly adequate for the job.
