This stapler replaces a traditional stapler like you might find just about anywhere. So far, this little stapler is a jewel. I think I may have finally found a stapler that works for me. Edited 3/26/13: after using this stapler intermittently over the last 2 months, I've changed my opinion. This stapler is brand-brand new... out of the package less than 30 minutes, and it already sticks a bit. It's like a stapler on steriods. LOL I ordered this stapler simply because I thought it perhaps would be easier on my arthritic hands since it stands up and you just need to squeeze rather than press hard with palm. I'd definitely recommend this stapler to all my family and friends. I loved this stapler. The stapler is handy for my computer desk top. This stapler works great it looks great it's cute and it staples with a loud click. I'm a HUGE stapler, because I believe in proper organization of papers and this thing is a Godsend.And it can take 15 pages at a time, just in case you have a legal issue going on or you ran off a long article from the web. !OK, I got carried away, but it's the finest stapler out there in my opinion. This compact stapler is so designed so ergonomically correct - it feels like a baby in the palm of my hand. I would definitely recommend this stapler. This stapler feels great in my hand and staples paper so easily, it almost is effortless. I've  always just accepted a stapler as....well ...a stapler... but this Paper Pro StandOut Standup  Stapler is a great new twist on an old desk tool. I selected this stapler from Amazon Vine because I thought the unique design would be interesting to use. Turns out, it is, and that's why it's an okay stapler to use.Because you actually have to hold it in your hand, the sensation of stapling paper together is different. This is a pretty handy little stapler. I like that the stapler stands for ready access is a great selling point. It is not a stapler for someone with arthritis or similar. The stapler fits in my hand in a very comfortable way. This PaperPro stapler is pretty decent. I think it's worth noting that you can't use this stapler to staple things to a bulletin board. This cute little stapler is a great color and it works like a charm. I took this stapler to work after two of them were taken off my desk no one swipes it since it doesn't look like a stapler standing up. The stapler looks small but takes regular sized staples. However, this stapler does what it claims to do... it makes it a LOT easier to compress the stapler enough to cause it to staple.Although the information says the stapler is smaller and "standup," it is still hard to believe that a little stapler can have any power -- intuitively, you just figure it will be *harder* because there's not as long a lever. I love this stapler. ), and this little stapler helps me conquer the sea of paper without taking up a lot of valuable desk real estate. Because I have this stapler, I can put a photo of my sweetie on my desk. For a stapler, it's great. I've got a PaperPro stapler at my desk that I love. So when I saw this upright PaperPro stapler I thought maybe he would steal that one instead or that I would like this one better since it is smaller and takes up less space.Nope. This stapler is a great value. PaperPro StandOut Standup Stapler, Blue (1451)is a well-rounded stapler. While the stapler is compact (saves space by standing upright), the product uses standard staples (1/4") which is a pro. Unlike a full-sized stapler, this product only uses a half-strip of staples at a setting so that could be a con if you are stapling multiple packets, etc. I have to assume that PaperPro tested the stapler on paper thinner than the 20lb-to-24lb copy/inkjet paper I have on hand.Bottom line: Conserves desk space, perfect for people stapling small stacks of paper on a regular basis, inadequate if you regularly need to staple more than 12 sheets at a time. This is one stapler that I can enthusiastically recommend. This little stapler may not look like a powerful tool, but it is! it's a cute little stapler and it seems to staple easily enough. This little stapler is small enough to not take up allot of room and the way it is designed to stand up on end is even better :) I love it :) So far I have been able to go thru 5 pages haven't used any larger packets yet :) Most of the stapler is constructed of plastic with only the staple holder track being metal. This stapler takes little space because it can stand in its end. This stapler is comfortable in the hand when using. So - not a truly heavy-duty stapler, but then it doesn't pretend to be.The design is clever and the color is refreshing. This is a good stapler for light duty office use since it holds only half the amount of staples as a standard stapler holds, and can staple only up to 15 pages. The stapler is ergonomically shaped to comfortably fit into the palm of your hand, and the spring loaded action makes one handed stapling effortless.2. Just turn the stapler upside down, and pull the centerpiece away from you, which will expose the slot for the staples. The PaperPro stapler can staple up to fifteen pages, the box says - I didn't test it for quite this amount, but the average document size I generate is between 4-9 pages, and it worked fine for all of them. This little stapler fits in your hand, and yet packs a wallop with each staple. You don't have to worry about having the stapler slam back down onto your fingers while loading. I found this to be a nifty stapler for home use. The stapler is supposed to staple up to 15 sheets at a time, but I think 10 pages is more like it, though I guess it would depend on the thickness of the paper.It works quite differently than a regular stapler and the staples are loaded in a different manner too, though this is not much of a problem, and users just need to get used to it.J
