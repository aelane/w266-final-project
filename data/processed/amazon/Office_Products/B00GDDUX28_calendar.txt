It is a sun-sat calendar (personally I prefer Mon-Sun format, but that's me.) It is a working calendar - well designed and well executed. With this new calendar, we are able to start it when we want (ie the beginning of the school year), and have plenty of room for everyone's events, work schedules and appointments! The calendar is nice and large and designed for families. Second, this calendar is rather clunky and unattractive. Unless you happen to find yourself needing a new calendar in, say, April, I don&#8217;t get what the benefit of this calendar is. Like any other calendar, this one is only good for one year, so I&#8217;m really not understanding what the benefit is of having to fill in the months and days yourself.With all of that said, assuming you want or need to fill in your own months and days, this calendar does offer plenty of space for appointments, including separate sections for &#8220;yours&#8221; and &#8220;theirs&#8221; so women on the go can keep their own and their family&#8217;s schedule straight. This calendar is very easy to hang on any convenient nail or hook and it&#8217;s easy enough to flip to the next month when the time comes.I&#8217;m not really thrilled with this calendar, but my husband did helpfully fill out the months and days and hang it up for me, so I guess I&#8217;ll be using it. If you&#8217;re starting your calendar in some other month besides January, I guess I can see the use, but otherwise, any other calendar will probably do just as well. The calendar has tabs that make it simple to find any of the 12 months.A message section also allows you to write and wipe but also has a cork area where notes can be pinned. The calendar is 0.4 inches thick, 12 inches wide and 19.5 inches long.This product is great for organized people, obviously, but it&#8217;s also great for more mature people like me who have problems remembering where they should be at any given point. This calendar is big so it can handle a lot of entries. With this calendar I have the space to organize everyone's schedules, plus since I am writing the dates in, then I can even add the extra week of the new month at the bottom. This calendar has really helped us to all, literally, get onto the same page. The calendar has metal spiral binding so it hangs on the wall fine too. This calendar isn't intended to be THE calendar so don't expect to be able to write all the info you need for a particular date. And while I did complain about it before, at least you only have to fill out this calendar completely one time.
