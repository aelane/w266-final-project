You can wear it around your hand just under your knuckles, or around your wrist, (I like to wear it around my hand) and is secured with a flexible, soft elastic band, which is adjustable to fit a very small hand or a large man sized hand. The old one used to slip off my hand all the time, which made it so frustrating that I'd end up going back to the regular tape dispenser. But I'm not going to buy it for myself since I'm cheap!On the other hand, if you do a LOT of wrapping, then the time savings could make up for the expense. Simply hang on with one hand and reach over to grab tape with the other, and you're all set!It's a simple thing really, and of course it's not a necessary item. It attaches to your hand or wrist, making it impossible to misplace. Instead of on the hand, I prefer to wear mine on the wrist and it fits very comfortably. It was so difficult to open that I sliced my hand open on it when it finally released. Designed to give you an extra hand free while wrapping gifts, the Scotch Pop-up Tape Handband Dispenser is a clever idea. It fits neatly on your hand so you can dispense tape quickly and efficiently while wrapping or doing projects. It slides onto my hand easily and is far easier to use than a standard roll of tape. This makes wrapping SO much easier, since one hand is usually holding the paper on the box so you only have one free hand. It can also be worn on the hand (across the palm or fingers), but I found that a bit cumbersome.If you find yourself needing to wrap packages (or otherwise use a lot of tape) and for whatever reason don't want to buy a desk dispenser, this is the perfect solution. It easily fits over one hand with a comfortable stretchy material, and makes wrapping mass quantities of presents a snap. It's very easy to use since it's right there on your hand. But, strap this to my hand? As you wrap, it allows you to keep your hand on the wrapping paper, keeping neat and tight. It is simple and easy to use, by just wrapping it around your hand. Your hand could then get acclimated to pulling the tape and using it respectively in the same manner. On the other hand (which is the problem--I'd like to reserve it for other uses), a "headband" dispenser might be even better. Though I prefer wearing this on my wrist instead of across my hand, this is a great way to package without having to go far for small, pre-cut pieces of tape! It sits on one hand, and dispenses pre-measured pieces of tape, enabling the user to work one-handed with the other.
