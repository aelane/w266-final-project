I use this paper as my all purpose paper in my law office. It is not as cheap as the cheapest paper but it is more presentable, and yet it is inexpensive enough that I now use it for almost everything. This is my favorite paper for printing documents and just all-around everyday printing on an inkjet printer. This 22lb paper can get a little wavy if soaked with ink from a very dense image. I really am picky about the inkjet paper I use. Also, the paper allows you to write on it without bleeding...another big plus. The paper isn't too light, and is a good consistency. This paper works well with our HP Photosmart printer. the last several printing paper orders came from amazon and for a free two day delivery service, it actually came the very next day. The HP All-in-One Printing paper is the best for the money. I would recommend this paper very highly!I find that Amazon.com is a wonderful site and I would recommend buying from them any time you can, whether it be for this printing paper or anything else. I do find that using HP paper in an HP printer results in less jambing. neaded a paper that was a little heavier for a project and this works great thank you thank you norm But given it isn't that easy to find good-quality 22-lb paper (in my experience, 20-lb paper is too thin and color bleeds through; 24-lb paper is a little too heavy and more prone to jamming in inkjet and all-in-one printers, though color does not bleed through), I can't really complain. 22# paper is not so easy to find however I have gotten 12 packs here at Amazon over time. It is the only paper I have used that will work in 3 printers and 2 faxes I have without a single jam and has not yet left any buildup on any of them.

This is quality paper that feels a little thicker than the printer paper I have used before.

It's paper and it's white.

What more can I say about inkjet paper?
