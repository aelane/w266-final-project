We own an older, full-sized Fiskars paper trimmer, so we're already sold on the reliable job it does, but liked the idea of a lighter, portable version that's easy (and safe) to pack up and take with you.At first glance the Fiskars 12-in Portable SureCut Paper Trimmer would appear to be a cut above the rest--the Titanium blade slides easily over as many as seven sheets of paper at a time (although, if you're dealing with a higher grade of paper, five would probably be advisable)making clean cuts along the wire rail.There's also a handy swing-out extension arm that allows you to accurately measure sheets as long as 14.25 in. I've used a small Fiskars paper trimmer (Model 95907797 - still available here and elsewhere) for about 10 years. I really like this paper cutter. I'm used to paper cutters that are so heavy you get a workout moving them around, but this is lightweight and portable and does a great job. This paper cutter is awesome. The Fiskars paper cutter advertises itself as lightweight and portable, and that definitely is correct. So if you're after a paper trimmer that can be used "on the go" this unit will meet that need. If you do paper crafts as a hobby, or want to make up some notepads from time to time, or similar uses, this unit will work for you. I mostly use this paper trimmer to cut adhesive labels, trim photos, and miscellaneous home office tasks. If you need just the occasional paper trimming, this cutter will do the job. This paper trimmer appears to work well for the intended uses of trimming sheets of paper or photographs.
