Still the pencil feeds in at a relatively uniform rate, and pencil after pencil comes out razor sharp. This pencil sharpener is on the small side and I like the less bulky, rounded design. Electric pencil sharpeners are pretty low-tech items in today's world, so I thought one can't be all that different from the next one - and that's largely true.The electric X-Acto sharpener is a no-nonsense implementation...pretty simple to use: set it up, it stays put, and when you put a pencil in, it comes out sharp. It appears to be well built and heavy enough to sharpen a pencil decently. However, upon sharpening a pencil, the motor seems to be straining and it took longer to sharpen a pencil than with other electric sharpeners I've used. The pencil once sharpened, was evenly sharpened and the point was good. I had only ONE pencil out of the 120 that did that whole "sharpen-break-sharpen-break..." cycle that annoys you by using up half of the pencil. But I really think that had simple been a defective pencil with an already-broken internal lead, since the other 119 worked perfectly.This gives me a NICE sharp point -- VERY sharp! I have owned and reviewed quite a few pencil sharpeners. For an electric pencil sharpener, this X-ACTO Workpro has very little power. The pencil would have been much smaller had I not pulled it out. If you push the pencil deeper, the motor stops.The shaving receptacle is big enough for several pencils before emptying up. I don't know about the "pencil saver" feature....  unless I really finesse with the pencil, it just eats it up. It does sharpen the pencil, but it does so slowly. Seriously - they can sharpen a pencil in a few seconds. There is just one pencil size the sharpener accepts, but how often do you have a thinner or wider pencil? You can push it harder to restart, but you certainly know when the pencil is sharpened.
