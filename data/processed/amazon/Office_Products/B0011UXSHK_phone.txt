I also purchased a small phone and plugged the unit into the usb ports in the hotel computers that I stayed at. This phone comes with all the services you could want -- those that the phone company charges $6-$8 monthly for each one. I wanted to have my own phone line in my house. Loving the phone bill cost. This drives me absolutely crazy when having a phone conversation. I just purchased an Obi VOIP phone adapter to try out with google voice. The phone didn't work at all in my area, so I tried to get customer service on the phone for return - nada. This means that you can't hear the phone ring and andwer it from the computer - you have to reconfigure three sub-devices, which means that the person who called you has given up and hung up by the time you can say hello.Now it will probably work for most people in a simple home configuration. I plugged in an old phone to the MJ and it all worked extremely well. You attach a normal phone line on the other end and that's it. It also allows your phone to use its own voice mail. If you press the phone "on" button once or twice the dial tone will come on. The phone we are using is just a normal (cheap) phone. It was not the phone and it was not the internet connection, so the only other thing is the unit itself. It so happens Magic Jack phone device doesn't work.

That's all....no other phone bills.

Then it assigns you a phone number with the area code of your choice and you can then start to call people.

No premium phone calls allowed unless you prepay - so it is safe to put the phone where anyone can use it.I plugged it in - and it didn't work.
