And printers just don't last that long with us. I've been using Epson printers for years now, and I've found them highly reliable and very user friendly, and this Work Force 3520 is no exception.~Set up~For the most part, this is the most complicated process for most people, since setting up a wireless printer for the first time can seem confusing. Many printers claim to handle duplex print, but really amount to having you print on one side then turn the paper around yourself.What I don't like about the printer: Nothing major. We can't get printers to last very long around our house before we're having to replace them. I guess with all the printers we've had, this is our first Epson. Some of the other printers require you to buy an adaptor to use the WIFI, this one does not. Automatic Duplex (Double-Sided) Printing, Scanning, and Copying.I say 'automatic' because some printers have duplex features but you have to manually put the paper through the printer/scanner/copier again after the first pass in order to get the other side printed/scanned/copied. It is not always as intuitive as other printers (such as the back paper load tray it doesn't seem to like you use for anything I've found yet. Like most other printers, there is no USB lead. I wish printers would remedy that issue. I've had Epson printers in the past and I can say that they are durable from a mechanical and electronic standpoint. Something else my HP didn't do.They claim it's the fastest all in one - I haven't timed all printers in existence, but I can say based on every all-in-one printer I've ever used, nothing printed documents this fast.I fired up the Epson software on my iPhone 5, and it found the printer immediately. I used to sell printers. The printers control panel is easy to understand and use, with nice size icons that you don't need a magnifying glass to see. As with other Epson printers the cartridges come fully loaded and last longer than the ink from other brands of printers. I Have three other printers which have the paper top-loaded at an angle. On some printers if you run out of one color you're dead in the water.Yes ,the ink is expensive, as with all printers, but you can save a little by shopping around and buying the higher capacity size. Sometimes I wonder if it would be more practical to just toss the printers when the ink runs out and buy another printer with it's ink included.
