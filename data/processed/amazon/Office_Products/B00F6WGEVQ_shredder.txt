This isn't the fastest shredder I've used and definitely not the quietest, but for a compact basic personal shredder I was surprised at how well it worked. This shredder from Swingline is exactly what I was looking for.First, it's powerful. Overall this shredder is everything you could want for the home or small business environment. When the shredder is on, it has a green light indicator.Some of the features I didn&#8217;t like was although this model will shred credit cards, it shreds them directly into the paper basket. I usually leave my shredder in my &#34;office&#34; at home (unused third bedroom) and I pull it out into the great room when it comes time to shred things. I found that the shredder slowed down & struggled a bit when I shredded unopened junk mail...(most of these envelopes had more than one sheet of paper in them.) The shredder handled all of them...just slowly & in  a struggling manner. If you'd like your shredder to last a while, you probably would have better results following the instructions in the manual.This shredder has a separate bin & shredding area for CDs, DVDs & credit cards. If you're interested in this shredder, give Swingline Customer Service a call & ask them about the discrepancies.I was ready to give the shredder 4 stars, but have removed a star because the product description doesn't match the instructions in the manual. I like this shredder for several reasons. I am reviewing a personal shredder and not a high volume, high dollar shredder. I promise you can find a personal shredder for half the price but I also promise you will get what you pay for. It's a small shredder for small jobs. This is a good shredder for minimal shredding functions. This shredder is a confetti cut, also known as cross-cut, and is the most popular type of paper shredder, because they offer a higher level of security. I put the shredder top on, plugged it in, put the shredder on automatic. The shredder has a slider switch for "off", "on", "forward", and "back" operations, with one green indicator that lights for the last three slider switch positions. The shredder also has a smaller 4 and 3/4 inch second shredder hole on top for shredding CDs and DVDs (cut into three pieces) and credit cards (cut in half) into a small internal bucket that can be attached to the larger bucket to keep the plastic separated from the paper. My previous shredder, the Fellowes W-11C 11 sheet, has been my main shredder for some years. The shredder bowed it out and fell right inside when I put it on almost squarely perfect. Nice, relatively inexpensive shredder, though I wouldn't try to shove 12 pages into it in a single group. That said, this is not a big shredder and it is certainly not a heavy duty shredder. It's too loud and I prefer a confetti shredder. While it is a lovely shredder, we did not want to spend another $200 for a second shredder for our other home office.Enter this cute little shredder from Swingline.
