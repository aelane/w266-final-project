Since I did not need Ooma Premier I decided to stop forwarding calls from my Google voice number to my home phone. I can now make calls with my Google voice number showing on the caller ID. Outgoing calls from our obivoice service are configured to send our Google Voice Home phone number for Caller ID.There is a lot included in the:"BYOD home phone service for $39.99/year for your OBI - obivoice".[... I setup Callcentric on SP2 and could only make outgoing calls. Now I have unlimited free calls to anywhere in the US and Canada. Google automatically filters all calls identified as spam directly to a spam voicemail folder, so they do not ring my phone. I receive all the calls I want, when I want, where I want, and NONE of the junk. Now, I can't get calls in.So I try to log into my Google Voice (Google is now = evil). ************** Update 2 *********Decided this is very unreliable for remote calls. I've placed & received calls. I make international calls often and also had a land-line, but I was able to port it to Google Voice after porting to T-Mobile Prepaid. #2 Google Voice for incoming and outgoing calls (technically if you don't want to use Google voice but want to have two different VOIP providers you can do that as well). When the OBi wasn't picking up the calls, the calls still went directly to Google Voice Voicemail, so it wasn't too big an issue for me, especially since I don't use the number much.
