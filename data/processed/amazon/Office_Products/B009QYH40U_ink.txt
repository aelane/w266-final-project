the ink here does erase with a slight imprint where the writing was. They are also have seperate ink so you can buy replacement ink for it. The ink disappears immediately when the marks come in contact with an iron. They erase well providing you wait for the ink to dry. The ink is also erasable, which is really a good feature for when scrap booking with children, who always need to "fix" their writing. The ink will disappear when ironed. They definitely erased, but the ink was not very permanent and would even rub off when your hand passed over the page.Welcome to erasable pens 2.0. The ink is truly removed by the friction of rubbing the knob over the ink. And when I say fine, I mean that you can't see the ink...no ghosting. I like it because of how easy it is to write and erase with the ink. The ink on these is the same- it's relatively light and see-through, which is fine by me. The ink does seem to have durability despite being removable, and disappears with friction.The main advantage of the clicker vs. non-clicker is you can't lose the cap, and the eraser is always available.
