They aren't thin little white boards with magnets on the back, they are substantial and solid. The boards are worth the price alone, after all the pen is going to eventually dry out anyway, but the boards will last for a long, long time. With two boards, I think there should be two markers, assuming they are used in different places.It sounds like others did not have this problem of poor magnetization, so maybe mine are an exception. These are nice little &#34;white boards&#34; that are great for making notes on the fridge at home. These boards are great! The boards and the magnets are thick enough to allow excellent adherence to our refrigerator.The problem was that there was no magnet on the pen. The boards are easy to write on smoothly and erase easily. The boards are GREAT. And they almost are.The boards are a very convenient size. The boards are backed with magnets so that they can be attached to a refrigerator or other metal surface. I did find that the boards could be wiped clean with a paper towel, but an eraser would have been nice to have. There are two white boards. These boards work well on the side of the fridge for a few notes. Overall the boards are good and sturdy, they are replacing several post it notes. These boards are very handy if you like writing little notes for correspondence between family members, taking quick notes, small grocery lists, reminders, etc..

I had some cheap RoseArt magnetic boards for our refrigerator, but they're starting to de-laminate so I've been searching for replacements.

Both boards have designs on some of the edges.

Keep the boards, ditch the pen.
