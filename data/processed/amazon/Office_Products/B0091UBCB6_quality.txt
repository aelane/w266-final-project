I have longed for a quality wireless printer that allows for all of the computers on my network to print via our wireless network. The quality of printer is excellent. * Print quality: while clearly ink not toner, the results are very crisp and look close to toner for images. Truly a quality printer that I hope stays on the market for a long time and they get the one major flaw worked out. Easy set up, great quality and a slick package, I can't believe this much power comes in at this price!! This is another quality printer from Epson. The quality is very good and it is quite a nice in home printer. The quality of the scan was simply amazing. Print quality was excellent. Not CRAZY fast but quality was perfect - no errors or splotches or missing pixels.I don't know what they mean by "2x durability" on the box. Has high quality color printing. Print quality and speeds are comparable to similar units and I just plain prefer the way that Epson has the menu navigation set-up. Print quality is superb.
