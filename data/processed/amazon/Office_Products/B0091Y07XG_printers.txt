Unlike the some other printers of this size, this printer uses five individual ink cartridges -- including two black for both document and photo printing.As with most Epson All-in-One printers, it works wonderfully with the Epson mobile app to use with iPads, iPhones, and other devices. All the Epson printers I've used have been easy to set up, have had fantastic print quality, and lots of great features. Most printers have pull-out output trays for the prints to rest on. While most printers tend to have a user-hostile interface, this one is very easy to use that even your kid will be able to figure it out. I have several Canon printers each with large numbers of color ink cartridges. I don't plan to look any further or try any more similar printers. Not as sharp as you would get from other high-end larger printers but the results were good enough to satisfy my needs. I have experience with many printers and all in ones from many different manufacturer lines. This printers USB connection allowed me to install within minutes. I've got two other Epson printers, as well as an HP. I already own three Epson Inkjet printers, the WorkForce Pro WP-4020, the Artisan 800 and the WorkForce WF-2540. Epson printers - they print out really nice documents and photos, but there always seems to be a problem with them in some way. I have several printers that I use in various situations, some connected to a network and some dedicated to specific machines. This is among the smaller printers I have used and it is nice to have more room on the desk with this printer in place.The front panel of the printer is an LCD touchscreen that provides access to many of the functions available to the user. We aren't heavy printers in our house, so it could take me 6mos or more to find out if this is the case - on the older Artisan 837, we printed so rarely that I only had to replace the ink once in a year. I have setup numerous printers, pcs. Indeed, all 4 of these printers I've had offer AirPrint and Wi-Fi. Oh if this could be incorporated on all printers it would be heaven. Almost all printers for years have have offered real nice printing quality. Even though printers try and be all things for all jobs, I have found, in my limited experience that is usually not a good idea, as something usually suffers in the trying.

Both printers have a front located USB port but the XP800 also has memory card slots providing wider accommodation for alternative data storage/transfer options.

You know, I love my Canon printers.

(This is not unusual in printers that utilize individual color cartridges but it can be extremely frustrating.)
