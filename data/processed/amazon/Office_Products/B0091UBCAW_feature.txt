I really wanted to test this feature out, but there are literally no phone jacks in my home, so, I couldn't Fax even if I wanted to. But, it's an awesome feature to have, and works well. Too bad, seems it would be a good feature for many people even if it needed an accessory purchase.I'd be happy to have the film holder device rather than the FAX part of this, myself. I first loved this feature on Brother printers, as those three color cartridges always seem to use up one of the colors faster. That feature, no tray to pull out and wrestle with, is a big plus for me. But the feature I never had on any of my other printers, and sorely needed, was the automatic document feeder. It is so much more compact and feature rich. Awesome feature.

As well, you can use as a stand-alone photocopier.The second best feature for scanning is the automatic document feeder (ADF).

Still, ADF's are a great feature for an inexpensive all-in-one unit like this.

I believe it, and I really needed this feature.
