The color is true to what claims to be, which is a bright pink. It is a pretty color but the cover has wrinkles and it is flimsy compared to what I expected. The color is cute (bright pink) but on the whole, I think I would spend a little more for a better binder or a little less for a comparable one. Bright color bold stands out. I like the bright color. The color looks like it does in on my screen. First off, the color is so pretty! The color is very nice, bright and bold. I like the color!

It's a great color, although we've had some durability issues with this binder in the past.

I really like the bright color of this binder as it makes it easy to keep track of and lets me have a little fun with decorating it.
