The files labels perform as billed, which makes them not only a more flexible labeling solution, but a money saver. We also change files as some get worn out or we need something larger to handling a growing file. They work well on temporary files that I must set up also. I put them on my files and best yet I can just pull the sticky labels up when I want to change the files. This saves my files instead of having to get new ones and write on the new files. The files look neat and clean. I reuse my files all the time and got tired of old labels peeking through or the surface of the folder coming off with the label. Most of my files folders are handwritten or from before I started. These will be really handy for the files that I only need for a little while. These will stay on your files for years unless you decide to take them off, and then Voila! Your files are like new again. I like to reuse my files however I also do not want to stack label on top of label or tear a regular label off a file and have an unsightly torn mess.I love these labels because1. This inspires me to get rid of those old files that have several layers of labels on a tab. I like to keep my files neat and when I realized I had lost of plastic tabs and no more inserts, I was faced with the unpleasant notion of having to hand-write the labels and stick them in the plastic. I just finished setting up my files for the new year in about half the time it took me last year. Someday I may convert to "paperless" files (if I ever find a great scanner) but for now I'm just thrilled with these removeable file folder labels.
