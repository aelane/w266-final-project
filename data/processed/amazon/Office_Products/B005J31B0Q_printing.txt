The printing is clear and crisp.I will just add that the two-sided printing feature is VERY slow. Standard printing is fast, but allow plenty of time for two-sided. For two sided printing on the 4020, the driver on the Mac does not allow for that from the Layout page. You must instead go to the Two-Sided printing page while in the print driver. Even though the printing capacity is lower the black inks cost significantly less if you shop around.Print quality is excellent in normal or higher quality, but economy ink saving prints very faint and isn't really clear enough for easy reading and certainly not suitable for anything but quick draft printing. Double sided printing is fantastic and you have a lot of control of things like print density and can also set drying time manually before it turns the paper over.The wireless printing is very easy to set up and I had no problems printing from my cell phone.If you get a good quality inkjet printer paper, the images come out bright and sharp and dry fast with no paper sag. Also supports Apple Airprint.+ Full-duplex printing!Cons:- The starting kit is a bit stingy. However, having said that, if you are looking for clear, fast, and economical two sided printing, then this machine is for you. The two-sided printing feature is especially useful and is easily turned on and off through the interface There are numerous settings for handling different types of documents and the printer has the ability to create custom shortcut settings. Duplex printing is especially useful and is easily turned on and off through the driver. ; Two sided printing is another great feature allowing saving of paper if desired.AIRPRINTJust a word to fellow iPhone / iPad owners out there - this IS an AirPrint printer!
