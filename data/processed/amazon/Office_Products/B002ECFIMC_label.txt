Just make sure the label is dried all the way before you stick it on...a couple blows does the trick. The Avery label pad is very convenient to store. One might say a label is just a label. While somewhat insignificant each label is colored. These would require you to place another label over or toss the folder. ProsThe label pad is easier to fit in my desk drawer than a sheet of labels.The labels are less prone to getting wrinkled & ruined b/c of the thickness of the pad.Nice size - both the pad (about 4"w x 3"h) and the labels (about 3.5"w x 5/8"h)ConsIf you have a need for a lot of one color vs. another, it can be awkward to flip through the pad for that color on each page.I only needed 3 colors (vs. the 4 colors provided on each page) for one filing project, so I had many pages left over with only 1 label per page. They peel off easily and stay stuck -- you can always place another label over the top if the folder contents are changing again. They stick well and ink does not run on the label. I found them to be the perfect label for organizing my studio, so that now I don't have to look in several boxes for what I need. Each label has a small blue, red, green or yellow stripe along the top of the label. This label pad is new to me, and I found it very useful, for when I am organizing things when I am not at home on my computer. You just write on the label, peel and stick!

They cost around $0.02 a label which is a little pricey.

I can hardly imagine what a 5-star label would be like?

Even when I use a larger label it always looks honky.
