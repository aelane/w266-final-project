The handy hand grips are perfect too... There is a hand hole on two sides of each box to assist in lifting. The hand holes made me concerned that spiders might want to crawl in and make the boxes their home. On the other hand if you are one that would normally purchase boxes for your whole move anyway, then these would be fine. The hand holes and lid tabs would also cause a problem using them for shipping but you could cut the tabs off and not punch out the hand holes and tape over them. These hand holds are thickly padded and easy to grab on to. On the other hand, if you were using these around the house, or using them to transfile papers, non-valuables, etc. The hand holes provide ventilation, but the top can be secured so the cat doesn't escape. One hand I was opening the door, other free hand I went to pick up the boxes (all folded nice in plastic and wrapping.

The Moving Boxes, on the other hand were a little larger and probably wouldn't fit the way I would want in my closet, and for all storage related purposes I would probably go for the Banker's Boxes.

The built-in hand holes are actually very well thought out.

Compare to the hand holes in normal boxes, assuming there are hand holes to begin with, the tabs wrap around the hand hole to prevent the box "cutting" into your hands.3.
