It also forms well to the wrist. I've not been completely happy with the usual gel-based wrist supporting pads I've been able to find. The Fellowes I-Spire wrist rocker has a nice design, is comfortable, and has a very sleek mousepad that is good for gaming. They typically only raise the wrist slightly. It's quite comfortable and I've grown to like it fairly quickly as I can truly rest my wrist there rather than have it hover over the pad. This is a nice wrist rest that conforms to your wrist better than most foam products. I have had wrist surgery for carpel tunnel and Dequervain's syndrome, and I still wear a light wrist brace to protect my wrist. This helps the wrist, in my experience.The slight drawback for some users may be the lack of a grip to the surface of the pad itself. The wrist rocker is a nice add on. My wrist and hand got tingly from loss of blood circulation. It keeps the wrist and hand at a good angle and feels nice with a little 'bounce' to it to help keep your wrist happy.The mousing surface itself is very slippery, and my Microsoft Wireless mouse glides over it very smoothly, sometimes too smooth. This one comes with a very comfortable wrist pad that is designed to help keep you more comfortable if you do a lot of mousing over long periods of time. I also am not too impressed with the wrist guard - I GUESS it is supportive on my wrist, but it sure doesn't look all that nice. I have been concerned about excessive wrist fatigue and possible Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. The wrist support itself feels much more sturdy than the flat portion.

So far, it feels pretty nice on my wrist and I'll probably continue to use it.

Some wrist rests have a covering that will eventually fray over time, and this one doesn't.

Normally my wrist would be hurting, but my hand is not fatigued at all.
