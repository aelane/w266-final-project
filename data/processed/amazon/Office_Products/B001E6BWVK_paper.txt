She likes the heavier paper and separate areas on the pages. The paper is of a good quality and the cover will definitely help to protect the interior but this product wasn't as mobile friendly as I was hoping it would be. Bright white paper on the top 2/3 results in easy-to-read contrasts with dark pens. I like the slightly wider-than-normal, slightly heavier paper that Mead often includes in its notebooks. They use quality paper which is great- just writing something on the quick notes you can tell.They sent me a white cover instead of a black one which was strange but I like the white better so I am happy. It has lined paper, with a place for the date and page at the top. The paper is perhaps a little thicker than the cheapest school notebooks, but nothing special. The paper is oddly printed into separate white and yellow sections which are both labeled &#34;Quick Notes&#34;. This is just a paper notebook. )The paper is standard; a bit too absorbent for wet inks like fountain pens or markers, but stands up to ballpoint and gel inks just fine. Heavier paper would have been nice but, would have boosted the price and, isn't necessary. I found that the paper stock (20lb) is sufficient to stop page bleed from my favorite Sharpie brand pens. The only pens that bled through this paper in my experiments were sharpies and whiteboard pens. It's ultra-white paper with highlighter-yellow 'QuickNotes' sections at the bottom.
