My board is now even!Then, I started to hang things on the board. It hadn't.Would I pay $12 for this board? I'd look for a board with thicker cork. This is a very small board (the size of a legal size piece of paper). The board pictured is a bigger board and it looks like there is a lot more cork than there actually is. to be able to hang much on this board. I love this board, the reason it did not get a five star review is because the mounting pieces that came with it were cheap and I couldn't use them. Its also an attractive little board, with a nice looking frame, so I think you could put up anywhere and be happy with its appearance. Included with the board is two metal hanging brakets, two screws, and two hollow wall anchors. I mounted this board near the desk/phone area in my "office" and it has proven to be a very convenient placement - it helps me organize project plans and projections for the next quarter. I am not even sure what I would use a board this small for - I am sure somebody needs one this size - and if you do, it will be perfect. Otherwise, get a bigger board, or one with a smaller frame. This legal paper-sized board is just what I needed to post notes and scraps of papers in order to keep my desk from becoming cluttered. I need a board for important information, tasks, etc. this board has a VERY thick black frame, which takes up a lot of surface area.you are left with approximately the size of a legal sized sheet of paper worth of corkboard area.it's not heavy (weight), so it stays where you hang it.it's functional, just very small.if this is what your space can allow, then this is a good product. This board is small and light enough that the 3M hangers work well. I am actually sitting here looking at this board as I write this. Previously, I had a much bigger white board for names of clients and tasks, but it ended up hidden behind an office chair. Beware that while the total board is indeed 11x17, the actual cork part of it is far smaller than it appears in the product picture. The board looks nothing like it did before we received it. It's a nice board but it would have been better to have the cork thick enough to avoid push pins from almost poking through.
