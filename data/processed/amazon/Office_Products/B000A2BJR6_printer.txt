Unfortunately my printer decided to give up the ghost, but my husband can use it in his. I have a Canon printer so I use their ink. I have a Pro9000 Mark II printer so I'm picky about the ink I use. Some of that might have to do with the printer cleaning its print head automatically but I suspect that the ink just sloooowly drains out over time. That happened to my printer and that is why I bought the replacement tanks. Don't see that with the HP printer! When I bought a printer last year, I purposely purchased a printer that had separate ink tanks so that I wasn't wasting my money throwing out whole ink cartridges that still had ink left in one color but not another. I have a 13X 19 printer and I think the ink tanks are lasting pretty long, considering I sometimes print 13x 36 prints. soooo small and pro9000 printer wastes last bit of it. I ruined a printer by using generic ink. Although this costs more it's not as much as a new printer. If you have a 5-tank printer, chances are the CLI-8PC and CLI-8PM aren't compatible with your printer!Value-----I stint on ink and print my documents almost exclusive in grayscale at the DRAFT quality mode (my Canon IP4200 printer uses the CLI-8 color cartridges even though I don't print in color). I love my printer, really. I absolutely love this printer. I have noticed that the printer alerts me to change the cartridge way before it's time.

I bought a high-rated printer to get good pictures, so why go with ink that is a couple of dollars cheaper?

It isn't worth damaging my printer for the generic inks that aren't as good anyway.

My current printer (and this ink) seems to last for about 25-50 pages, and only persuades me not to print very much in color.
