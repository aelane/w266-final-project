I have to admit, I love having this pen stand on my desk. The stand is definitely a bonus so you can organize the pens. With this stand you don't have to waste time searching a container or risk losing your pens. They came with the nice stand; we just leave the stand with the 44 pens at the center of the dining table, and they use them for everything. I also like how securely they sit in the stand. The stand makes for a nice addition to any art/craft area. The stand is sturdy and makes it easy to choose the color you want quickly. The stand for displaying the pens is awesome as well.The only reason why I give these pens 4 stars is because the ink bleeds through the paper. The stand is pretty cool if you have a desk to set it on. The five-tiered stand is sturdy and functional, and you can arrange the pens in any order you like. With the stand, it's easy to organize them by pen type or by color, or simply go random and discover! The stand is pretty cool too.

The stand is well crafted and set up so that it takes up very little room on my desk.
