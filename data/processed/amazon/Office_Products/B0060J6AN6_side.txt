It is on the side, so if you have the box stored so you see the end, you still have to pull it out to look in the window. The side holes are permanently open. (DVD's,on their side, come right up to the top of the side of the box)The boxes feel nice and sturdy, and should last for quite awhile if used for storage and not for everyday use. However, on the side of the box near the bottom, they put their brand "Bankers Box" and thus it somewhat detracts from the look of the box.These cardboard boxes have a plastic handles that easily slip into the box. The clear side makes it quite easy for me to see what is stored so I do not have to bring down the entire closet every time I am looking for a certain item.The handles are both a pro and a con. *The large clear side panel is nice, you can see inside of each box even when stacked several high. The down side would be over time they would get kind of dirty and dingy however, and they're not particularly big, but they are a good tall size and you can put all kinds of things inside! But I had to  force it on.The clear side panel is a nice feature. On the plus side, the see through windows are a nice touch, the storage handle make lifting an awkward size box easy, for cardboard the boxes are actually pretty sturdy, and when you are not using them you could collapse them and store them flat somewhere.

I had to hold one side while pushing the other side, at an awkward angle, so it took several tries.

The clear front side window make it easy to spot what's inside, or even have an index sheet showing through so you don't have to rifle through the contents when you need to put your hands on something quickly.

However, one side of the box has two windows cut into it and there's a clear plastic strip to drop in before folding this side in place so that you can see what's in front.
