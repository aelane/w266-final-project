I was easily able to insert the paper, photo, or several pages of paper, straighten them, and then manually clamp them down. I like the paper clamp option, so you can keep your pictures or paper locked in place. What's paper cutter good for? And it won't bend the paper even for cutting a small fraction of a inch.Inserting the paper under the aluminum bar was easy for one sheet, but it's won't be easy for multiple sheets.It has a paper clamp option to keep your paper locked in place. If you're more the "this looks like I just put the paper in and slide" type (or even the "I'll read the directions and follow them to the letter type), you should probably skip this paper cutter.In short, I read the directions and tried to cut a piece of cover-sheet weight paper; after 10 minutes with no cutting action going on, I was about to throw this thing against a wall. At first, I couldn't get any paper under the bar that holds the blade. With the paper clamp in place, it was no problem if I didn't cut through all the sheets -- the ones that had been cut fell away, and the others stayed in place. Great paper cutter. I think that is a major inconvenience.Inserting the paper under the aluminum bar was easy for one sheet, a bit more of a challenge for multiple sheets. This paper cutter is like the kind you might see at Kinko's or at your local school but instead of the huge cleaver blade that can chop off your finger, this one has an enclosed blade that only cuts when you put pressure on the plastic guard.The blade then comes out of the guard and cuts the paper, safely away from your fingers or whatever body part.The blade cuts very well and you can replace the blades as needed.It does hold about 15 sheets of paper and can cut cardboard about that thickness with no problem.Only downside is that you must apply downward pressure during cutting to engage the blade so this could get tiring if you are cutting a lot of paper. Don't load too much paper at once. This lightweight paper trimmer is a functional piece of gear that does exactly what it says it will.
