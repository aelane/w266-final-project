When this cutter arrived and I opened the box, I found a cutter that was plastic....How long? But compared to a wooden cutter, the price is reasonable. If I were using the cutter more often and to cut more than paper (say, thicker paper or cardboard stock), I'd think about getting a more sturdy model. This is a great cutter and works amazingly! As such the cutter works well enough. So I need a cutter that can do the job. All in all, an affordable cutter that works well. I really wish I had this cutter at the time.For the price (~35), I really like the functionality for the value of this product. This isn't the biggest, heaviest or sturdiest guillotine cutter in the world, for sure. The entire cutter, aside from the blade, is made of plastic... it's extremely lightweight, however it's also very sturdy. Was looking for a lightweight cutter that wasn't too bulky but could still handle several sheets. I love this cutter.I
