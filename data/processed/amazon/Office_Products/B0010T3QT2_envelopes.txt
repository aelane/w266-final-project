I hate licking envelopes and prefer using security ones to protect confidential information from prying eyes, so I thought I would really like these. They also are more convenient than licking envelopes, so they are handy if you find yourself stuck with a sudden need to mail a bunch of stuff and don't already have a professional service in place. The envelopes have a flap that protects all the glue. These are fairly standard, self-seal, business-sized, white envelopes. "These Home Office envelopes have a couple of excellent features:#1 is that they are "reveal and seal," meaning you don't have to rip off any paper strip, or lick some awful gluey substance, but just "lift here" where it tells you on the bottom flap of the opening, to reveal some very strong adhesive that looks like it will really do the job for a long time, should you be mailing your letter to Antarctica or beyond.#2 is that its blue and white checkered design on the inside covers the identity of the contents well, if you are mailing a check or anything private. These are easy to use, self-stick envelopes with a privacy blue print on the inside. I hate licking envelopes. I love these envelopes. These envelopes won't necessarily keep someone from illegal or unauthorized snooping, but they will increase your odds of knowing it happened. As envelopes these are fairly sturdy and good quality. Secondly, to seal these envelopes you just lift the folded flap and seal, no strip to throw away and nothing to lick. These are really nice envelopes for every day mailing and I can easily send them through my ink jet printer to fancy them up. These envelopes seem fine to me. These envelopes are really wonderful. I really do love these envelopes!! !I can always use envelopes. These envelopes will definitely get used!! After sealing 3 envelopes, I placed them inside. I found these envelopes while searching for envelopes to use for international mail. I sealed one of these envelopes and let it set for a couple of hours, and I feel that it is tamper proof. so these envelopes are perfect for someone like me. Number ten envelopes are business standards and these remain securely sealed. The envelopes themselves are made of a nice albeit not staionery quality paper.They are inexpensive without being cheap.These are perfect for safe, secure everyday use. I can't really compare this to other adhesive envelopes since I rarely use envelopes. These envelopes definitely accomplish their job. These envelopes have improved communication between home and school. Self sealing envelopes are not a new idea. The envelopes do not feel flimsy at all. I'm happy with these envelopes. These envelopes seal very effectively, though it takes some practice to get used to them.You have to lift the edge of a small flap on the back of an envelope (picture above), then fold it out of the way to expose and adhesive that attaches to the flap of the envelope itself. The envelopes are of a very nice quality. These are very nice envelopes. ...envelopes are becoming quite amazing and just in time to be nearly obsolete. These envelopes take away most of the hassle and waste when mailing letters, thanks to the self- adhesive closure and the fact that there is no pull- off strip.The main attraction of these envelopes is the way they seal. The envelopes will tear if any effort is made to open them.Envelopes are not all the same, in spite of what some believe. These envelopes work as expected. These envelopes are sturdy and self-adhesive. I picture all we Vine folks out there, testing our envelopes, and I must say I find the image funny.On the bad side.The box these envelopes came is is made of very thin cardboard that tore easily as I was trying to open it. Yes, if you hold these envelopes up to the light, and the check or letter etc.. is not covered, you can read the information, with maybe a little more trouble than with a regular thinner envelope.When I deplete the free box from Amazon/Vine, I would buy these envelopes, but at a cost of approximately 14 cents per envelope, I would only be using them when something important is inside and I want to make use of the tamper feature. These envelopes are so easy to use. These "Reveal-N-Seal" envelopes are good enough for daily use, but are far from being high quality "security" envelopes. When we ran out of our normal envelopes, I tried these hoping to find a similar envelope that recommended by Amazon. The envelopes themselves are pretty standard weight and paper quality--not at all fancy, but not thinner than average, either. What makes these envelopes great is that they seem to be pretty tamper-proof. These envelopes are nice overall. These envelopes were supposed to show a red warning if they had been opened. Use of the above envelopes will not ever guarantee that it gets there or somebody saying I opened it by mistake. The envelopes shipped to me were reasonably opaque; on casual handling nothing showed through except the general outline of the contents if held up to a window or a ceiling light. No more licking envelopes (yucky) or using a wet sponge (messy and leaves the envelopes soggy and wrinkled if you use too much water.) With these self-sealing envelopes none of that is necessary. Unlike most envelopes that have a triangular assembly pattern that can interfere with writing on them, these are smooth on front and back. These envelopes seal tight and protect your information by not letting people see thru. These are standard #10 envelopes with a security background inside so that contents cannot be read through the envelope. I think I may stick with the regular cheap envelopes that you have to wet the glue, I think they are more secure in not being able to open them easily at the glue point. And not sure how long those envelopes been around but the box was never opened. They should ban those envelopes!! Seriously!So, with that being said, I said that I'm going to start using envelopes with adhesives. No more licking yucking envelopes or accidental paper cuts on your tongue and here we are with Quality Park's Reveal-N-Seal Envelopes. If there are cheaper envelopes with these same features then I would buy them instead. These envelopes are good enough for what I want but if there was a cheaper alternative I would get those instead. Nice, sturdy envelopes. Great envelopes made from high-quality paper. These are the only envelopes I use any more and I have no problem in recommending them to my friends, family and other businessmen. The envelopes will be great, but several were severely wrinkled due the to package Amazon Vine chose to use for shipment. Solid envelopes with secure imprinting so nothing shows through once inside. Nice, practical envelopes. I don't particularly like licking envelopes, so I really like that these are self-sticking. The envelopes have a darker security pattern than the Mead brand that I have been using. But with these envelopes there is nothing to worry about. These envelopes would be especially good for mass mailings. These envelopes are fairly user friendly, you just lift up the folded down bottom tab which exposes the adhesive and fold the flap down. These are great envelopes. These envelopes are great for everyday use, and I really like the feature where there isn't a strip of paper to reveal the adhesive. Thank you for these great envelopes on Amazon Vine! Unlike other envelopes I have used, the adhesive here is protected by a small secondary flap. I know I will be buying these envelopes again in the future. These are simple envelopes with some moderate security features. I am used to just using regular envelopes to pay bills and I am not all that concerned about the transparency of envelopes. These business-sized envelopes feature self-adhesive glue and patented (US 6,732,491 B1) tamper resistence. (My old self-adhesive envelopes, bought at Staples, were really easy to re-open.) When I received the envelopes, I enlisted my children (15 and 9) to help me test them. First, we sealed three envelopes. Then we resealed all the envelopes and examined them. With these envelopes you have to lift a bottom flap, and then pull-down the top flap. These are nice envelopes. I won't hesitate to re-order these envelopes. These envelopes offer an added layer of security. While envelopes are not a product one would likely get enthused over, I can say that these are an improvement over self-stick envelopes I've purchased in the past. I really like these envelopes. These envelopes makes sealing quite faster.Another feature is the way the ink turns red if the envelope has been opened,which would allow the recipient (if familiar with this) to detect the crime of opening one's mail. Some envelopes may require a bit of tape to fully secure the seal, but nothing that an ordinary envelope wouldn't sometimes need, without the hassle of a wet seal. I usually get my envelopes at the dollar store, so I thought I would try these out to see what the difference was. I've used 40 of these envelopes over the last month and have found the "Reveal-n-Seal" strip to be workable, so no complaints there. These envelopes are designed to give a little extra security when you mail important, private, or valuable items. This seems effective.I'm keeping these envelopes for sending of bills and medical information. I needed envelopes so I picked these up. I hate licking envelopes!! These envelopes are a standard legal size, no window, security envelope that you do not have to lick in order to seal.They have a self adhesive strip that you fold up part of the envelope to reveal then press the top flap down onto it. Sometimes, one must use his/her own #10 envelopes for mailing and depositing personal checks. Also, the Reveal-N-Seal envelopes are not any more water resistant than my standard Mead envelopes.I
