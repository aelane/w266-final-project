The machine does put off an odor, which is to be expected with a product meant to melt plastic, but I didn't find it overpowering and it dissipated not long after the machine was off.I have only used the laminator so far with 3-mil pouches. This machine doesn't disappoint in that regard. As with the Saturn 2, this Fellowes machine is great for laminating sheets that you want to write on and wipe off. I recommend this machine for personal use or a home office that needs more than an occasional lamination using a maximum of 4 mil pouches. I have wanted a laminating machine for awhile now, but the ones I saw at most stores looked cheap and cost too much. This was expensive.This machine is heavy duty. However, when using the machine, you will want to make sure there is enough space in front and in the back of it so that the sleeves can glide through it. This machine came with the laminating sheets to use. I like the machine and find it very easy to use as well as very useful. I've wanted a laminating machine for some time now.

This machine can be used by caterers and restaurants for all sorts of things, from menus to table-talkers, to place settings.I have never used a cold laminating setting, so I did a search and came up with this: "Cold laminating film (sometimes called tape laminating) uses pressure sensitive adhesives to bind the film to the material being laminated.

Once you select it the machine flashes while it's warming up.

The machine takes only a few minutes to warm up for heat lamination and produces a few beeps when it is ready.
