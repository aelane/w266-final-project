The arm was very, very easy to install. Overall, a great arm. My right arm actually became unusable. Lifting my right arm in a reverse curl was nearly impossible (which is what happens when you type) so I did it with my left hand and propped it on a wrist pad. So what does all of this have to do with the 3M Dual-Swivel Monitor arm? Although this doesn't look as clean as an enclosed arm, such enclosures can be too small for all the cables if you have the monitor connected so it can be switched between two (or more) computers. The arm can be mounted in two ways: through a grommet (default) or clamped to the side of the table top. This arm is very well made and sturdy. This arm is perfect for my 22" Viewsonic VM2223 monitor that I purchased back in 2010 from Dell. Our arm is clamped off center and we found we only needed the one arm to center the monitor on the desk and have it swing out a good foot from the wall if needed. The arm itself adjust easily and the tension can be adjusted.You can swing the arm and monitor in multiple directions. I chose to use clamp.Putting the arm together was a breeze. You can choose not to tighten the arm joints and are then able to freely move the monitor pretty much any angle left / right, tilt left / right, push in / out from your viewing position. That then snaps to the arm via a ball joint swivel piece -- again with a button to release from the arm. If you are looking for a sturdy and well-built arm this is definitely one to consider. I have my 21-inch Cintiq on a Ergotron LX arm that I can adjust much more than this one by 3M. I have the 3M Dual-Swivel Monitor arm mounted to my 5' Ikea Galant desk and it's working perfectly.
