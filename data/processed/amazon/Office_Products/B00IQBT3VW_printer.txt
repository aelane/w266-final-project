I love this printer. With this printer I'm able to do that in minutes.The wireless feature works perfectly. This printer is fast, convenient, works fairly well, is surprisingly quick, etc. )Overall, it's a decent printer, and fortunately those set-up quirks only happen once. Basically the printer prints out the page, pauses a second while it changes the path and then pulls the paper back in from the output tray to print the opposite side. This printer is surprisingly difficult to get on my home wifi network. I know it's possible but using the printer config menu is like stepping back in time about ten years. And the Samsung doesn't send a manual with the printer. This is a fast printer. For this printer, you want toner #MLT-D116L. This printer is easy to use, easy to install on a mobile device or computer, and prints with superior quality. It functions as a printer, copier, and scanner. It only prints one-sided and it's a black and white printer (it's two biggest limitations). Granted, the printer I have been using is at least 10 years old, but this thing is easily 10x faster and I'm thrilled about that.
