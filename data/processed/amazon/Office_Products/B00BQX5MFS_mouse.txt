But even for using the mouse occasionally, this is a Godsend!The lower part is a squishy and movable wrist rest. The mouse pad area has a good amount of room as well. Good height.Highly recommended if you use a mouse with your computer. (I use a Logitech M-510 optical mouse, in case that matters to you.) The mouse slides on it without issue. This is my favorite mouse pad with wrist guard. I currently use a cheap little mouse pad without a wrist rest that I got for free. The mouse pad section of the Wrist Rocker is paper thin, which doesn't impact its effectiveness, but makes the Rocker feel sort of cheap. So, we switched out her mouse pad with the gel insert and got this one for her. Compared to the Fellowes foam-flexible wrist-friendly mouse pad, how does this wrist-rocker rate? This may be because I have grown so accustomed to using the mouse without a trackpad, and the change was uncomfortable for that reason.I'm sure someone with wrist problems would benefit from this device, it allows your wrist to rest while using the mouse, but for me it was simply uncomfortable and strange. The mouse pad is very thin but good enough. I'm much more comfortable with a normal mouse pad with the heel of my hand wristing on the pad. I have tried other mouse pads with wrist rests, but this has proved to be my favorite so far. If you have been using a fabric-based mouse pad previously you will notice that the mouse will be more responsive and you will need to get used to this responsiveness or go into the mouse adjustment menu in Windows to recalibrate it. The mouse pad is not especially attractive (dark and light gray stripes)and the base is plain white cardboard. I tend to keep mouse pads on average three years. Got this to review and I noticed it is LOUD when I move the mouse around. The mouse tracking is excellent. This is my new favorite mouse pad. It is truly the best mouse pad I have used. The mouse moves easily and precisely on the smooth Fellowes surface. Especially when I first started using it, the mouse would slip around and I would miss what I was trying to click on.
