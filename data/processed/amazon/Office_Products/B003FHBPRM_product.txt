So when I saw this product I thought it was an interesting idea and decided to give them a try. I have to say that unfortunately this product is NOT WORTH IT.First complaint is that there is NO readily available instructions for "installation" it may seem like a simple idea but I couldn't figure out which flaps were suppose to go where. I think the product is a bit pricey, however. This product seems more born of marketing than of necessity. With this product you get 3 light cardboard dispensers that hold an accordion-like line of 3-inch square yellow post-it notes. But is this product really needed? This product is probably best suited for the mobile office types or conferences where these can put inside program folders. Post-it Laptop Notebook Dispensers may be the most innovative product to emerge from the 3M laboratories in quite some time. This product works as advertised. It just didn't look like a very good product. Given this product is pretty inexpensive, this product may still be viewed as a good deal after considering the very marginal benefit that this dispenser provides. I like this product. I cannot recommend this product, the quality is poor and the reasoning behind the entire idea seems faulty to me. This product is a really neat concept, but you can't write on the whole post-it until you remove it from the dispenser and apply it to something. It is a convenient product, but not wholly functional. This product is the equivalent of putting bumper stickers on your laptop. This product isn't going to change the world or anything, but it is useful and I can see myself using it often. This product is not an exception.There is always the good old notepad application on your computer, you might say. That's exactly what this product is.In fact, I need a post-it right now...There! Ahhh!This particular product is troublesome on three counts. I am giving this product 4 stars as a compromise. They are truly a wonderful product and it's too bad my local stores don't carry more of their innovative products. This product is just OK. It is not a product for, say, protecting the supply of Post-its you carry in your pocket unless you first  attach it to something else (which could be just a thin piece of cardboard!) This product works as advertised. Having this Post-It product in the top corner of my tray is *so* convenient!The package comes with three dispensers, either to have 3 locations for your Post-Its, or to just choose your design of preference. I think this product is great for those people who are not sitting at a desk each day. I really like this product. This product is called a "laptop notes dispenser," but really, it can be stuck to most any flat, smooth surface. This product comes with three small sticky pads and three dispensers. They can be placed just about anywhere, and that is what I love about this product. While it is not the most complicated product, you have to remove the adhesive strip on the back in order to get to the instructions. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this product. I guess this product could be helpful for some people... but it was a bit annoying to have something stuck to my laptop lid..and it seemed to get in the way. This product seems to be a stretch.... This has to be the most ill-conceived product from Post-It yet. Is this a product that I like using? What I like about this product the most is that it's recyclable---no plastic, it's all paperWhat I don't like: It's cheap and you could do approx the same by separating standard blocks of PostIts...and probably at a cheaper price!What can I say? This is a very useful product! While this particular product did what it was supposed to do, marginally, I kept asking myself why it was needed. The product includes 3 dispensers-fuscia, gray, lime green, and 3 20-page accordian pads.
