I use this laptop lift with my Mac Book Pro 13'' and it fits just perfectly. It is a comfortable lift that acts similarly to an 'ergonomic' keyboard as your wrists are angled up and not resting on edges of your palms. This allows the lift to be lightweight however it certainly does not feel worth near 30$.- Because of the unit being completely plastic, there is no 'rubber' platforms so that it holds the laptop firmly and securely on. If you tilt the lift, the notebook will slide off. This laptop lift by Fellowes works well, elevating my laptop to a decent viewing height on the desk, and the keyboard to a decent typing angle when I'm hanging out on the couch and have the computer on a side table (no that isn't the use it was designed for, but realistically that is how I use my laptop). I decided to try this laptop lift and I have to say that I am impressed. This is a nice sturdy laptop lift though. Fellowes I-Spire Series Laptop lift works great. I LOVE this laptop lift. The laptop lift is very sturdy.

This laptop lift helps keep your laptop elevated so that you dont need to "look down" on the screen. This laptop lift nicely positions my laptop about the same height as my external monitor so that I can convenient view both of them. So the lift helps that part. since the lift sits completely under your laptop, it does not block any ports on the sides either.

I believe you could construct a simple lift of your own for a fraction of the cost - it might not appear as smooth and stylish as this device but it would suffice if appearance is not an issue.
