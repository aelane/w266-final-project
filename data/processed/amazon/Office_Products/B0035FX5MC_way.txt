This simple yet very effective way of dispensing them solves my problem perfectly. It enables a very nice way to use the post-it notes, so it's really not a fault, or rather won't be once I buy a giant stack of these type and use them solely.Great idea, and eventually when I run out of the other post it notes, I'll use it, but it might be sitting unused for awhile. The only way that I could recommend these are for people that are constantly moving their post-it's or the ones who seem to always misplace them. A way to tie the pen to the holder might be a good upgrade. Thumbs way up! Very convienent way to keep post its. This is a very nice and handy way to keep Post-it Notes within reach in unusual places. Its a convenient way to store these, and they come out with ease! So, I guess the way you would tend to use this most often would make you want to choose one style over the other. If you're looking for a way to have Post-It notes handy on say, the fridge door (or in my case, the side of an external hard drive) - or really any flat surface, then this is for you. A great way to keep those Post-its AND a pen handy (what good would it be to have a post-it handy without a pen? That way you can actually *find* the notes when you want them again.There is a little place for a writing tool, not really deep enough for the jostling it takes in the camper, so I really don't keep a pen in there while driving, but once settled you can put on in and it stays. This is a very clever and convenient way to easily remove one post-it note at a time. I know its not the ideal way to deal with my mess..but it does add a bit of class to using post-it notes on a regular basis.
