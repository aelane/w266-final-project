Overall, the phone quality is very good, though not as good as C__cast. Just remember that canceling the phone in a bundled internet-phone package will cause the internet price to go up --- but it's still cheaper this way :-) The phone number I got from OOMA was being used by someone else. I am away from my phone right now and work late so by the time i get home you guys are out. They don't want to be bothered with repairing the phone all of the time. They have had reliable phone service all of their life. To port the phone number to another phone company, you need to provide this information.Phone Company - OOMAAccount number - Your phone number with OOMAAccount holder nameYour addressYour phone number Ooma is the best phone service I've ever used, no doubt about it. !I was so sick of my overpriced phone service. They established that I had a functioning phone line to the house (check!) Cutting the phone was the easiest option to cut and migrate to VoIP.I had looked at the Ooma Telo back in 2010 but really wondered how a company like Ooma could sustain with their current business model ... especially after seeing the company Sunrocket go out of business?! Voila, I now have phone service at all my jacks within the house. Our current phone service didn't include Caller ID and we've been inundated with unwanted sales calls. What this amounts to is that when I set up my Ooma I had to be assigned a phone number from Eastern Maryland, which is a long distance call for my next door neighbor. Otherwise, you will be stuck with a phone number that is long distance to everyone in your calling area.Another problem that I ran into had to do with the actual process of getting my phone number ported. That's all I want from a phone system. I was able to obtain a phone number in the new area code where we will be living. I can now begin to give out the new phone number and answer the phone as if we were already moved to the new house.I'll check back here after we move and have some time using the system.Update March 4, 2011Still in the old house with 3Mbs DSL and 756Kbs upload speed. After hooking up the Uniden phone system to it the problem of entering digits is gone. The phone is installed between your cable/DSL modem and your router or computer so that it can manage internet traffic and optimize call performance.Now that it's connected it works satisfactorily. No actual phone is included with the device but it is easy to hook up your existing home wiring and existing phones via a single telephone cord plugged between the OOMA telo device and any telephone jack. The phone voice quality was superior to our landline even while using it on our crappy DSL. Porting the phone number means I didn't have to update any directories. I also get two phone numbers, conference calling, caller I.D. Our local phone company, AT&T;, was charging $40 for basic phone & caller ID & the prices kept going up. Caller ID means only phone number display.Caller ID outgoingKeep your own phone equipmentVoice MailConsistent monthly charge, no annual fees, increases or annual fee to keep my own numberReasonable overage or call limite911 - VoIP version of being able to call 911 and have your phone number, name and addressCall quality & reliabilityCall friends/family in another state for freeGood customer serviceRated well by others & not a Fail grade with the BBB.Ooma's features does all this list and more.Setup:Setup for the Telo was very easy. We have been thinking about the Wireless Adapter so that the phone doesn't have to be close to the modem - a great option if desired. They even have a phone you can buy that will display a photo of who's calling.FAVORITE FEATURESCaller ID Contacts List:Ooma has a great way of managing Caller ID. I'm so happy we switched to a superior phone company that offers amazing features and is so much cheaper. Nice having free phone service for a change !!! I would call it slightly better than mobile phone, and maybe slightly inferior to a really good land line. I will say it sounds good enough that I would find it advantageous to use it over my mobile phone for quality. I use my phone rarely enough that it's simply not a big deal. I encounter delay more frequently when I am calling IP phone to IP phone. A second phone line requires an special Ooma handset (plus the $10/month "Premier" subscription), so it won't work with 2-line phones.
