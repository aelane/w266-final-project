I absolutely LOVE this dispenser! )but the new dispenser makes everything so convenient and user friendly! This is a great little dispenser for Post-it Notes... just grab one of the Pop-up style Notes, pull, and you're ready to write! The dispenser is sturdy and uses a fantastic non-marking adhesive that you can attach just about anywhere - I actually stuck it on an unfinished wooden shelf in my damp basement with no problems - and has a little compartment for you to stick a pen in too.As well as this is designed, I have to admit that I still prefer my regular old pad of Post-it Notes for most uses. I successfully attached the 2nd dispenser to a vertical plastic in-box. The dispenser saves desk space and looks tidy with colors that match the Post-it Notes. With this handy little dispenser you won't misplace your note pads again. This is much more than just a cheap dispenser (two actually)! This dispenser pack comes with two packages of brightly colored notes (one package was blue, one package was pink), a dispenser with pen holder and Command adhesive strips for mounting.Put one on your fridge, put one on your desk and stop digging through drawers for them in a pinch.The Command mounting strips allow you to take the dispenser on and off the mounting point, so it's not stuck in one place. This is a great dispenser to hang on the refrigerator or side of your desk!! They pulled out very easily without the dispenser coming off every time you pulled one out. This sturdy dispenser has a pen holder and comes with a standard supply of pop-up notes. I haven't tried it because I'm not planning on removing the dispenser, however.The pen holder is short, perhaps allowing for easy pen removal should the dispenser need to fit in short spaces, but a standard pen dangles and sways, giving the appearance it may fall out. If post-it had a dispenser to wear like a bracelet, I would have one in all the colors. There isn't much to note about the dispenser; it serves its purpose of holding Post-It notes, letting you pull them out one at a time, always having one ready to grab. Additionally, I am worried that when I remove the dispenser, it may also damage the paint on the wall. When I saw this wall-mount Pop-Up dispenser, that utilizes the 3M Command adhesive strips for instant removal that wouldn't damage my walls, I knew I found another item I had to have! The dispenser even comes with a holder for your pen or pencil so it makes it easier to write whenever you need to. It is the best dispenser we've used for "accordion" type notes. This allows the dispenser to always have a fresh post-it available for use, but probably means a more expensive, specialized purchase for the consumer. The dispenser and the adhesive are held together by two tiny, interlocking pieces of Velcro. By putting the dispenser on the wall (or any other uncluttered vertical surface) I am sure that the post-it notes will be both visible and accessible at all times. This is a clever little dispenser that is easy to attach to a wall or computer desk or whatever. The dispenser is offered in green, blue, and pink but where is the ubiquitous yellow?The convenience yielded by this product is sure to be minimal for most. I received two dispenser, one blue and one pink. The dispenser looks and feels nice and the notes are held secure inside. The dispenser has a place for a pen, but it is not good, it is shorter then the dispenser height, just over one and a half inch tall inside, so regular size pens do not stay secure inside. I'm happy to do that, except - the dispenser? The dispenser and place to put a pen don't add much value for me as I'd rather buy a pack of Post-its and take them with me as needed. Each dispenser has a pad of sticky notes, and a place for a pen. The dispenser is small and compact, easy to mount, pretty sturdy (it holds up in a classroom with repeated use). I chose to install the dispenser next to my alarm's keypad which, if you are standing inside my private stairwell, is located on the wall to the left of my front door. However, the dispenser was relatively easy for me to install.Read the warnings; do not hang the dispenser on wallpaper or anything that is an antique or considered an heirloom. This dispenser is highly recommended for conveniently storing Post-it notes that can be used as reminders.Joseph B. Hoyos This allows the dispenser to have a sort of pop up effect, like a tissue box. This new dispenser is ever so handy and so simple to use. This dispenser uses the "popup" Notes so you just pull out one and the next one is ready to go.The mounting process is very easy. I've got this Post-It dispenser stuck to my desk and, ok, it's a handy little thing. I thought this looked like a handy dispenser that I might be able to mount unobtrusively for the standard size pop-up squares . This little dispenser works great! This dispenser can be hung on a wall or other vertical surface, and allows one to pull out Post-Its in pop-up form. The dispenser sticks to the wall with adhesive tabs that have velcro on one side, and are sticky on the other. This new dispenser is great for anywhere you want to have paper & a pen handy in a compact spot. The dispenser is not cost-prohibitive for a one-time expense and will save all kinds of aggravation when you need a Post-It handy. POST-it Pop-up Note with dispenser is poorly engineered. The dispenser itself works quite well, however, you have to buy the accordion-style Post-its to refill it. It comes with Command Strips if you choose to mount it.The dispenser also has a place for a pen which is nice. The pen dispenser is a nice feature as well seeing as this product would lose all of its importance without the pen hanging there along with it.The product lost a star because it uses non standard post its. The dispenser attaches to the wall with a 3M version of velcro. This pop-up dispenser from Post-it is no different. This dispenser is intended for the pop-up variety (which without a dispenser are truly annoying). To permenantly remove the dispenser, you pull a tab at the end of a strip which releases the adhesive. The dispenser comes with 2 pads of post it notes in the 3" x 3" size. Used as directed, they hold the dispenser very securely but if you decide you don't like it where it is and want to take it down, the strips can be removed without damaging the surface to which they were applied. The dispenser can be removed from the wall without having to remove the adhesive and then stuck back onto the wall. This is a handy dispenser for Post-it notes. The dispenser has a receptacle to hold a pen or pencil. You attach the dispenser and use it to keep your post-its off your cluttered desk. The dispenser includes a pen caddy.I liked this product, but ironically I still find myself using the traditional post-its which are scattered around my desk more. This dispenser now creates a central location for each of us where we know our paper and pen will always be handy. It doesn't "pop up" at you, but it works.This dispenser turned out to be very helpful for my elderly, arthritic parent who has difficulty grabbing small things. I would preferr to have a more neutral dispenser as well as neutral colored post it pad. It comes as a stylish white dispenser that can be easily affixed to most walls and various places; the fixative strips are part of the kit you get.The dispenser holds a pen of your choice, and a pack of Post-Its that are manufactured to be, as best I can explain it, sort of zig-zag: they are not like ordinary pads of Post-Its but are continuously attached so you can pull them out conveniently, one by one. This attachable dispenser is both easy to use, and not so difficult to set up. They use the dispenser setup, where notes are put in alternating orientations, each one's sticky part attached to next one's plain one, thus allowing to pick them easily. The dispenser comes with mounting strips, which are easy to use and quite convenient.These handy little dispensers also have a pen holder built in. 3M has designed a great dispenser for it's post-it notes. The dispenser lets you pull off one post-it note at a time, as they are accordian folded- one note comes off to the left, then the next one comes off to the right. This is a handy little dispenser. You can velcro the dispenser to a convenient spot and pull out your post-its quickly and easily. With this little dispenser you can now attach it to any surface and be sure that the post-it pop-ups will always be there unlike before where someone would walk off with them!T
