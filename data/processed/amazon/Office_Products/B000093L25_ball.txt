I like this ball. I have one ball at home. I find the ball all over the house and not in my office where it belongs Was happy when this arrived and even surprised to find out that it actually could bounce like a ball :)  Anyway, I've always been frustrated when looking for a rubber band...now as long as I don't lose this ball, I will always have a rubber band handy. The baseball-sized ball is reportedly made up of about 275 rubber bands. The ball is comprised of excellent wide rubber bands in a rainbow of colors, so it looks attractive should you want to keep it on your desk to be handy. Plus having them in a ball makes it kind of fun and quirky. This ball is the size of a small baseball and it's extremely solid. So .... it is nice to have a prefabricated ball for me to play with ... yes, I bounced it as soon as I received it. Here we have your typical ball of rubber bands. Much more convenient to have them in ball form instead of in a box where they can get tangled, spilled or extra rubber bands come out when you try to select one. The ball makes them convenient to store. The ball is nice and bright color wise, and the size of a baseball or a bit smaller. Obviously, a ball of them. As far as a ball of rubber bands goes, this rubber band ball is quite lovely. It's nice having this ball and I don't think we'll ever run out of rubber bands anymore. I haven't taken off that many and don't intend to because once I do I know I'll be too lazy to try and reform the ball, and I will also probably misplace all the rubber bands I took off. I am curious, though, as to just how they make a ball like this in the first place. A ball of rubber bands in a variety of colors. I though this was going to be a brightly colored ball that looked like a toy. It looks like what it is, which is an uninteresting ball of thin, dull-colored rubber bands made in Thailand. I'd worried that having them stretched into a ball might have made them less strong, but that didn't seem to be the case at all. The ball is just the right size to fit into the desk and still give you room to add more bands to it. I bounced the ball which really isn't part of its product description but it seemed reasonable.
