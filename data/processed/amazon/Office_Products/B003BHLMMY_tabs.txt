Secondly, the tabs are only colored on one side--this isn't a big deal, but that means that when using them in books, some of the tabs will face backwards, and the color will not be visible. Finally, I had initially planned on using the tabs in the side margins, but then I realized that I would not be able to store my cookbooks in my cabinet this way or the tabs would be crushed (this would also be true of anyone using the tabs in books that will go in a bookcase). These little tabs are good for organizing my daily planner. I can use them for tabs that I don't want to make permanent. The green and blue tabs are easy to see which makes finding what I'm looking for quickly a breeze. I like the colored tabs and the lines. I love to use these post-it tabs for my cookbooks. These tabs stick securely in a notebook and hold up to use very well. I've been using these tabs for 10 days, mainly at work. These Post-it Note Tabs have much sturdier tabs and so far, have never disconnected from a page.I use the lined note section only for reminders; since I move these tabs, they don't work for me for any note taking I may need to refer to again (that's what the note book is for!). Because of this, I find the tabs too large; I cut them in half so they take up less room on the note book pages. These tabs allow you to add a tab to any looseleaf notebook page or planner or any set of papers. They are sturdy enough to use as tabs for a document that isn't handled a great deal. These tabs are great. I've tried both these sticky tabs and the Avery ones. The colored tabs are not sticky; therefore these notes would be ideal for organizing a notebook or making notations in a book.The designers of these notes thought carefully about this product. You never have to worry about these falling off and going missing.The tabs themselves are very useful for organizational purposes. The tabs are heavy weight, they adhere well, they're large enough to hold just about as much information as you'll need to make a quick note of, and they can be repositioned. They are larger than usual tabs, and lined for indexing. I like this better than the plastic tabs. I'm going to stick with underlining and the clear-based tabs-- for me the additional convenience of note taking isn't worth the hassle of pulling the tab off over and over again.Perhaps they would be more convenient if your purpose was to divide a binder and not ruin the dividers by writing on them, but in that case I think it might just be cheaper to buy new dividers. However, you can't really put these tabs on a piece of paper that has writing on it -- at least if you want to read the writing without removing the tab.

You can write on the Avery tabs, and they are clear so they don't block the text underneath.These Post-it tabs are useful for binders, planners, and paper piles (according to the product packaging).

I really love Post-it's tabs for all my note-taking.

These particular tabs are useful for cases in which you are concerned that you may forget why exactly you marked a page.
