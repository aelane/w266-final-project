), place the comb, move a lever, place the materials, move the long handle, and voila -- a binding job with a professional look!I would like to see  some improvement, though -1)I used a marker, drawing a line to indicate where to place the papaers and covers for proper punching. We have all seen comb combined reports before just many of us didn't know how they were made. I wasn't sure exactly how to insert the comb into the machine. You place the comb and open it with one handle. Then move the comb's handle to close it, and it's done!Regarding size and storage:The device is as large as a typical computer printer if you were thinking of keeping it out on your desk be forewarned you'll need to have a fair amount of space. Correct this by flipping the comb lengthwise from left to right and try again. If you already know how to use a comb binder, the Fellowes is perfect for small jobs. After the comb is pulled apart, the user simply places the pages onto the comb and then slowly pushes back the smaller handle. If you're too fast, the comb sometimes detaches from the pages, requiring the user to re-do the comb process.Overall, this is a nice comb binding machine. Once the Fellowes comb binder arrived, things changed.The binder is a breeze to use. I have this comb binder at home and the family has been using it for a variety of projects.
