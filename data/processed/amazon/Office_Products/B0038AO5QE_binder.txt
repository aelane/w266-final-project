in this binder for 2011, and it's going to look great after I finish designing the cover. I buy a new 2" binder at the end of every semester to keep important/relevant school papers in, and was intrigued by the idea of this eco-friendly version. One of the binder covers is already bent in the middle from my putting a book on top, so the construction overall is not very sturdy. Creating a recycled binder is a great idea in theory, but I find it lacking in execution and probably wouldn't purchase another. The binder appearance is rougher than I expected. I like this binder a lot because of the weight--it's quite light. Love this binder. Because it's a binder, there's not a whole lot of demanding performance criteria, and the ReBinder certainly meets the essential requirements: It holds 3-hole punched paper well, and the binder clips open and close easily. What more can you want in a binder?If you're worried that the description of the binder as being made of corrugated recycled cardboard means the flaps are flimsy or may not offer good protection, put that fear to rest. This is a good binder. Imagine a binder - with a cheap cardboard outer cover and that is all. This binder is literally cardboard - equally as sturdy as the box in which it was shipped. This is not a binder that would work for daily office use (and for sure not for school kids).
