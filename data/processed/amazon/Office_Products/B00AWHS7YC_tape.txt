This tape worked well. The tape is easy to tear and use. This tape functions as it should. I thought this tape might be for removing fingerprints from phone faces and iPads etc..  Duh. This tape worked well and was easier to use than regular packing tape. To use this tape correctly, wear gloves - very inexpensive to get a box of disposable gloves. Slowly remove tape and make a written record. The tape is clear and reminds me of packing tape but it seems to tear from the roll much easier. I used this tape for a school project involving lifting prints from a glass using hot chocolate mix and a make-up powder brush. The tape lifted the print excellently. I got this tape to use in a forensic science unit study in our homeschool. The tape tears easily and there was minimal tangling.The prints lifted by this tape were so clear that I was able to blow them up using a not terribly good projector. The tape can be used by anyone for this or similar purposes. I got the tape for a little iphone fingerprint sensor test to see if I could pull someones fingerprint using the tape and trick an iPhone 5 into unlocking. The tape tears easily by hand, but starting that tear is not as easy as it is once the edge has been started. However, the adhesive itself does seem to be thicker than regular tape. Once you do that, it is really hard to wrangle the tape without getting your own fingerprints all over it. The tape is easy to work with and lifts prints quickly and well. The tape does NOT stick to the layer underneath it, and rolls off fairly easily, and there's a lot of tape in this pack so there's little waste. Which is why they can sell this absolutely unexceptional tape for triple the price they'd get if they didn't use the word "fingerprint" on it.Most any clear tape is fine for lifting prints. Great tape, makes a great project for science class, or on a rainy day. Although this tape is known have applications in fingerprint-lifting and forensic evidences, it looks no different from any regular packaging tape. This tape lifts fingerprints from glass and printing paper, but not from my phone or living room wall (unless one has a very sweaty hand). This tape is a good replacement for the sheets that come in the fingerprint kits provided by forensics labs, and is dramatically cheaper than they what they charge, particularly if you go through a lot of them.Despite the current picture on the product details page, this tape comes on six 10 yard rolls, not on sheets, like you are probably used to. The tape is easy to tear and does a good job lifting prints , especially from smooth flat surfaces. The tape works even better with a sprinkling of flour or powder on the tape.A coworker of mine, working out of her field , has a degree in forensic anthropology. She also used the tape and had a very favorable impression of it as she made impressions of fingerprints. Most effective if you use an appropriately sized tape dispenser in conjunction with this, as it's a lot easier to work with than just using your hands and tearing off what you need. The tape does tear fairly easily, but a dispenser would make it easier. The tape does pick up fingerprints, as well as any dust or debris in the area When the tape arrived, I thought the rolls would be bigger.

This tape resembles the scotch tape we all use for wrapping gifts and sealing envelopes, but this tape is very clear and built to retain the integrity of the prints (or other materials) for which it's used.

If you do, I'll know it because I have fingerprint-lifting tape.

Both the tape and the Chromebook could be used to lift fingerprints even though you should keep in mind that you are also lifting the 2 lbs Chromebook when you do it with the HP but the Scotch tape is a lot lighter.
