I hung this cork board on my wall yesterday. This is a very sturdy cork board frame. This means that the usable cork space is only 8 inches by 13.75 inches -not at all the 11 inches by 17 inches as you'd think. Shrink the cork about 33% and that is more realistic. Great cork board, especially for the price. The cork board itself seems to be pretty good quality. This black-framed cork board is the size of a legal piece of paper.My tween has it in her bedroom for pictures of friends, cards, and to hang a calendar from.The frame is sturdy wood, and the cork is firmly in place.The hanging kit, included with the board, consists of two screws, three plastic wall anchors, and two metal brackets. I have attached this cork board to the inside of one of my kitchen cabinets so that I can pin up notes that I want to keep handy, but don't want floating around the kitchen, making it cluttered. This is a great little cork board, but it's shrink-wrapped and I live in a very warm region. What are you looking for in a cork board? The cork portion is about 9x15, so if you need a lot of cork space, don't get this one. If you simply want cork, look elsewhere. The cork is thick and fine-grained so it holds well.The size is great--big enough to hold several items but small enough to fit in tight spaces. This a nice, lightweight cork board that is in a convenient small size. If you need a small cork board to fit into a small space and have a classier, slightly more elegant look than the typical board, you might really like this one. I wanted a petite cork bulletin board to match my new motif in my office. I realized I can make it even more attractive by covering the cork with scrapbook or other paper. This cork board measures 11x17 inches which you probably see in the description so for perspective, it's the size of a legal sheet of paper. This cork board is smaller than shown in the picture and the cork is not 11X17 inches because the fram is wide. The cork is actually about 8X13 inches and is too small for most uses. Surprised at how small the cork area is, 13 3/4 x 7 3/4 inches. So having a great solid well build cork board is a must in my house. Too bad the cork board is such poor quality. The cork wouldn't hold the pushpin after about ten times. When I think of a cork board, I envision something larger, so keep in mind that this has a small footprint. It also works as a little cork lap desk, because of the size and construction. I love this cork bulletin board. This is a very tasteful cork board. The cork is nice and thick and holds stick pins well.It is handy to use for reminders, notes, cards and art work. The actual cork part works fine though. The cork area is only 8&#34; x 13-1/2&#34; which is a little larger than a piece of computer paper (possibly legal paper sized), so this isn't going to hold many notes/pictures. The cork is average with a corrugated cardboard back that the tacks go into. I'd like for the cork to be a little thicker, but honestly, it will suffice for normal use. The actual cork portion if this cork board is much smaller than what appears in the picture.It looks nice and feels sturdy enough.
