(It does have a carrying handle, but I would be hard pressed to imagine any high schooler utilizing that to carry it).-The internal mesh pocket is okay for holding pens, pencils and small items, but would have been more effective on the outside of the binder so that you don't have to unzip the entire thing to grab something quickly.Now, for a business person, I think it might work differently. It has a very convenient carrying handle. The handle is a little awkward, but not bad. It has a sturdy handle (nylon with a slightly padded grip) sewn into the exterior spine of the binder. The handle is great for carrying. That's OK; just use the reinforced handle for carrying.This would make a great gift for someone in outside sales, education, or any other occupation that requires easy access to lots of paper records, forms, or manuals. Finally, the handle is so tight that large hands might have difficulty getting fingers under it.Still, worth a try. It has a nice handle so I can carry it like a briefcase.

is it has a carrying handle.

The handle makes it look as a modern briefcase and depending of one's line of work, it's looks good enough to carry around to meetings and interviews.

I like the carrying handle, which is extremely practical.Another excellent feature is that you can access the file area separately from the inside binder area which contains binder paper and the various inside pockets.
