Pretty good, the paper tray feels flimsy and doesn't hold a lot of paper. It has a top paper feed and the regular front paper feed. What it doesn't have is a paper tray (it does have a flimsy paper holder. So your paper supply is subject to external forces (breezes from AC and people walking by bumping it). Ink and paper are easy to change and replace from the front of the printer. I like that the paper is front loaded because I can put it on a shelf and push it up against the wall unlike others that the paper feed tray sticks out of the back. The front-loading paper trays can also be a concern: to prevent the printer outputs from falling too easily onto the floor, you have to fully extend the output tray's rather short "tab" as well as the one for the paper feeder underneath the output tray. The inbound paper feeder itself can only hold a limited number of sheets at a time, so anything other than relatively small print jobs can become a hassle (thankfully, two-sided printing is supported !).

It is chronically afflicted with difficult-to-clear paper jams and print cartridges require regular  alignment/nozzle cleaning.

Also with the front load paper I can not close up the front like I can on the older one & still keep paper in it.Canon is a great brand, and from the HP's we use at my work to my canon I would keep the canon hands down any day.
