This board definitely fits that bill!It has so many potential purposes:1) Date/Weather announcement board2) Daily Event Board:3) Typing Practice Holder4) Writing holder for when my children need to type up a story or report they've written5) Easy to use spot for vocabulary word of the day6) Picture holder for diagram for science or social studiesAnd I can imagine many more...It will be easy to move so that all of my children can see it at the same time. The board slips in and then tilts back. The board weighs around 12oz and the Clip weighs 1oz.There are no instructions in the package or on its box, but it is very easy to assemble. The board serves as the spine of the document lift. The board is a dry erase board. You can only install the dry-erase board facing towards you. You can easily grab the board with clip, use that, and then come back and attach it to the base again. This easy-to-assemble board can be used as a document holder, a clipboard or a dry-erase board. The board can be quickly changed from landscape to portrait. It also has a white board on it so that when you are done for the day (or out to lunch, or off for the day) you can put a note to desk visitors, "Back on Monday" or "Back at 12p". A white board, a weighted base, and a clip. Likewise, the board effortlessly slides and locks into the base in portrait or landscape orientation. The board itself is ever so slightly larger than a standard 8.5" x 11" sheet of paper, so you'll always be able to write on the entire page without the paper resting above the raised frame. Also, the I-Spire Document Lift's board WORKS WITH MAGNETS! If using it as a dry-erase board, you could get a double-piece of velcro and velcro it to the edge or buy the dry erase markers that have a magnet (because the writing surface is magnetic). You can place the board in the holder/base in either portrait or landscape orientation. This would allow the board to lean over the viewer somewhat. The board's border rises about an inch from the surface, as measured above the surface itself. The board can be lifted off the base and carried as a clipboard. Secure enough, the board stays intact within the base, unless you really force it to become unattached or you don't secure it strongly enough.All in all, there is little to criticize about this product. Now, I can write on the board and stick memo papers to it as well.I also discovered that this is perfect for holding my iPad. Best of all is the white board. The board can be displayed either vertically or horizontally, and no tools are required for assembly. You have the main board, a clip on the top and a base. You can use it by itself, or use just the board and base to make a "sign". The board can be used horizontally or vertically.
