The staples end up right where I need them and it countersinks them nicely. You can even load staples while wearing gloves. However, if you only need staples, this is a great choice! All staples that were driven by either gun were driven nicely. The staples shot in without incident and were nicely countersunk. I can't believe how easy it was to use this and loading the staples took about 10 seconds. It came with staples and a great case to keep it in when not being used which is always a plus. It also can handle different sized staples which increases the number of jobs you can get done with it. Therefore if the only staples you have are in partial strips loading the magazine to full capacity are not possible. The staples did not misfire and at no time did the gun jam. Loading staples is easy, adjusting the exhaust nozzle is too.This thing had no problem shooting the 3/8&#34; staples into softwood of all types, even into their knots. The staples had enough force. It puts staples deeply into pressure treated wood, which I could hardly even do with a handheld stapler.It's a great price on this awesome little tool. The staples went in perfectly and it was really easy to use, even if it is a bit bulky. The staples are easy to load and don't jam. Loaded the staples incorrectly the first time, but the directions soon set me straight. It comes with staples and oil.
