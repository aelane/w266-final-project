The pencil is quickly sharpened to a fine, exact point, without being wasted. Very basic pencil sharpener that works exactly like I would expect it should. The electric pencil sharpener is one of those items you never thought you needed until you got one.Up until now we were content to use those, cheap hand-held manual sharpeners that tended to break more points than they actually sharpened. By that I mean you are suppose to gently but firmly place the pencil in the sharpener and let it work for you. They will invariably cram the pencil in as hard as their little hands will allow and see how much pencil they can eat up before you tell them to stop. I can sharpen a pencil within 3 - 7 seconds, and get it nice and pointy, without a wooden foreskin happening. It takes longer to sharpen a pencil. It may occasionally sharpen uneven if I insert a pencil at too hard an angle (up or down), however, if I use any care at all when sharpening, the results are perfect. I have used a Hunt Boston pencil sharpener for years. Thus, I was excited to try a pencil sharpener from X-Acto.The pencil sharpener looks like a high quality product. It is possible that my pencil sharpener is defective. This pencil sharpener by X-Acto definitely sharpens pencils well;  and I like that! If you really want a fine pencil sharpener, keep looking and be prepared for the possibility that you may have to pay a little bit more for the pencil sharpener you want. You'll also need to be cognizant of pulling the pencil out to check it (you can SORT of feel when the sharpener may not be working so hard to cut through wood casings any more, but you'll have to pay close attention to notice that). I had been using a small hand-twist pencil sharpener for a long time -- I don't know why because I do pencil art and constantly hand-sharpening pencils certainly slowed my progress. Now all I do is stick the pencil in the hole and it's instantly super-sharp. I was able to grind down a new pencil to half its size with no problem.Noticed that with "ridged" pencils (as opposed to round) sometimes catch on the sides of the hole when sharpening, as if the hole were a tiny bit too small. X-Acto Electric Pencil Sharpener (1818)is a nice, sturdy, powerful pencil sharpener for both household and office use. I bought this pencil sharpener based on its good reviews as a gift for my nephew. I have been searching for a pencil sharpener that could keep up with my girls for some time.
