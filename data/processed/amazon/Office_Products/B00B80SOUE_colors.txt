I like the colors. There are so many colors, some of which are metallic, glittery and fluorescent. And there are so many colors! They write really smooth, don't smear and the colors are bright and vibrant. I love the colors. There's not actually 100 colors (there are duplicates), but there are lots of choices. The colors show up well. The colors or the gel pens are quite nice and vary appropriately. Some pen colors will be clearer seen on dark paper but overall I am satisfied with this lovely set and will use it for a photo organizing project I have been working on. All colors, glitter and non-glitter. So many different colors! The metallic colors didn't seems to resist as well as many of the colors did. The other colors show up better too whether painted over with watercolor or drawn over the applied watercolor after it's dry.When using a consistent pressure they are so much fun to sketch with.
