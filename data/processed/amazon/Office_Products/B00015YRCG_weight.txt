These are a fine weight, but not as heavy weight as other page protectors I have used. These heavy weight sheet protectors feel nicely secure and provide a beautiful, clear view with no glare for both documents and pictures. Heavy weight pages are much sturdier than the lighter weight ones. I'm considering replacing the lighter weight pages I have because these are so much nicer. These are nice, clear, and heavy weight. I also use heavy weight paper back to back and it works great in these sheet protectors.I think these heavy weight sheet protectors are the best of the best. When I think of heavy weight I expect a heavy-grade thick plastic that will be more durable than their 'regular' counterparts. They are:&#8226; clear&#8226; heavy weight so that they don't rip easily (having used the lighter ones in the past I know how inconvenient lesser quality sheet protectors can be)&#8226; the print of the document won't stick to these after a while which is also very important, especially when you're trying to remove a document from the sheet protector.&#8226; it's archival safe too; acid-free; and, top loadingAll in all, if you're looking for reliable quality sheet protectors, you can't go wrong with this.

These "heavy weight" protectors are actually a little thinner than some sheet protectors, but adequately durable for most applications.They will not tear.

Heavy weight is the only way to go when you want to protect those precious photos, important documents, etc.

I don't know why these are classed as heavy weight protectors.
