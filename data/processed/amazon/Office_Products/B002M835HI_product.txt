This product made that process much easier by adding some incentive or me to the online shipping process, I simply used the UPS website, and printed the labels to one of these sheets and slapped them on the box. I couldn't be happier with this product, and already can't imagine going back to the old way of printing online postage labels. Good product and although a little cost prohibitive if you use a lot of them, it still might be worth it for your time. This product seemed perfectly suited for me.I used an HP LaserJet 4+ to print first to these labels, and it worked great. so that I can use this product. Anyway, I like this product for what I need it for. When it runs out, I can see splurging for this product, for the convenience's sake. This is a terrific product for anyone who has a home based or small business and needs to not only keep track of info, but also do it quickly and efficiently. They're accuratelyrepresented and a good product. Excellent product. I will keep this product on hand all the time, as we ship a lot of products using the Paypal label printing. This is one product I do recommend for convience. While I like this product, and it definitely makes my life easier since I ship a lot, I have trouble justifying spending that much money for labels! Right product to get the job done with less waste. Summary:  Good product but $0.50 per label makes it a little too pricey.
