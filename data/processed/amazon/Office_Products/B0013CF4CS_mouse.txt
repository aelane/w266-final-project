While I have my mouse set to be super sensitive and don't need much room, I'm sure others will be annoyed by the cramped quarters. The mouse has not "jumped" off the pad, so there is sufficient room. The mouse glides smoothly over the leatherette with no hesitations or interferes with tracking performance. Or you're looking for a new mouse pad then this may be a good one for you.It offers a comfortable wrist rest, though it does take a little bit to get used to. I had never used a mouse pad with a wrist support before. This means that if you have been using a mouse pad for some time that has more friction on the surface, you will overshoot your targets on the screen for a while until you get used to the fact that you are moving the mouse farther than you think you are. This could potentially lead to a broken mouse if it slides off and falls a few feet to hit the floor. Since I often leave my mouse-pad and mouse on the curved arm of my easy chair, this happened to me. Luckily the mouse survived its fall undamaged. If you are looking for a basic mouse pad with built-in wrist support, this is it!Seems like a fair value as well. This 3M mouse pad is a good basic mouse pad. First, if you have a mouse with a high profile, one that typically is dedicated for righties or lefties and has strong ergonomic curves, this pad will not work well for you. But if you have a low-profile mouse, which are typically ambidextrous, this could be the perfect pad for you. The 3M Foam Mouse Pad with Wrist Rest is an exceptionally comfortable mouse pad with a pleasantly plump wrist rest that feels like it has some type of silicone gel inside for added comfort. This little mouse pad is too small be effective even with my Logitech VX Revolution, a fairly compact notebook mouse. I found that using this with a normal sized mouse was a bit uncomfortable as you have to keep having to pick up the mouse to get back on the pad. But with the small mouse, you have much more control, and your wrist is actually resting. This mouse pad has the kind of wrist rest that is just high enough to make using the mouse very comfortable.The material it is made of allows the mouse not to skid and not to go in the wrong direction with a minimal effort. I don't normally use mouse pads that have wrist rests because they are always too puffy or tall for my liking, but this one is a pleasant surprise. I got this mouse pad to replace one that slipped around on my desk too much. When I'm writing I don't need my mouse as much, but when I'm editing photos it's all about the clicking. I hoped that it would help me to use my mouse with less pain.While the wrist rest part works well, I do not like the mouse pad itself. If not that, it does work rather nicely with any generic mouse and the wrist rest is a nice bonus. This mouse pad gives you the option of being on your computer for hours if you choose while allowing your wrist to relax. The mouse pad is sooo uncomfortable to me. I cannot use this mouse pad for longer than 10 minutes as my hand goes numb. Could hardly wait to replace my nasty flat mouse pad with this one with a nice firm wrist rest. This mouse pad has a no-slide mat that does keep it in place. This is a fine mouse pad. And, the flat mouse pad allowed me to move the mouse wherever I wanted to. This is a nice, compact, comfortable mouse pad that does everything I want a mouse pad to do and nothing I don't.I
