The product cleans easily and seems to wear well.The bottom is a molded rubber/plastic that is slightly flexible. It does not slide/skid at all which is nice.I would suggest this product for someone seeking a quality wrist rest! I wasn't expecting much from this product, but I'm pleasantly surprised. As such, I can really tell when a product designed to help CTS really helps, and this does not. If, like me, you just care about finding a product that works, this could be the wrist rest for you!Overall, I'd say this is a great product that I will continue using! and I find the product lives up to the information. When I received this product, I used it with theLogitech Wireless Desktop MK320 with Keyboard and Mouseand was pleased with the level of comfort. Great product. This a great product. Overall I am happy with this product and would definetly recommend it. There is an anti-microbial product protection feature that will impress many people. The product comes with a one year warranty. 3M also makes a similar product that is attached to a plastic board that the keyboard rests on that you can elevate giving you an angle for the keyboard.These both work with a standard rectangular keyboard. Because of this I stopped using n it, but I am not sure if I should blame the product or  myself.One thing I do not like about any of these is they are dirt  magnets. )Overall, it's a great product! This is a well made and solid product. This product is 25 inches long, which is far longer than most keyboards. I was VERY happy when I received this product. Very impressed with the product. I've used this product in the past and have always been satisfied with the comfort and quality. All in all, a good product that does what it's supposed to do. The 3M Gel Wrist Rest is a very comfortable product for resting your wrists as you type at your keyboard. Overall I find myself liking this product. This is a nice product - it is more than long enough to stretch across my keyboard shelf and it's heavy enough to stay in place. I am really pleased with this product and will be checking into whether or not there is an accompanying wrist rest for the keyboard as well. The product is thinner than some older wrist rests. For this product, some customer images show a rectangle, but it is actually straight along the top and bottom is thinner at the sides (like a smile). The product can slide around a little when bumped, but stays perfectly in place as long as my wrists are resting in it. If it wasn't as wide, this would have been the perfect product for me.So as long as your have plenty of space where you keep your keyboard, this will be a wonderful product for you and your wrists. Maybe it can be washed off.All in all, a product I wasn't sure I wanted but now don't want to do without. This product is quality and an easy recommendation as opposed to my old one, which feels like a rotted length of sausage that has started to take on a life of it's own. This is an easy product to clean, I useClorox Disinfecting Wipesfor mine.As far as customer service goes, 3M was EXCELLENT.I wrote an email at 9:34am asking about their return policy, and they advised me there was a 24-48 hour response time. This is a long product!)
