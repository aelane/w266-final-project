The paper itself is relatively glossy so some writing instruments may not work as well but this also means there is less chance of bleeding from inks. The special paper doesn't seem to really help in the picture taking and I used a normal note pad and it seemed to do just as good as this pad without the high cost. The paper is thick enough that my fine tipped ballpoint and gel pens do not bleed through. The paper is quite thin so those who enjoy using fountain pens or even some wet gel pens will see bleedthrough on the back of the page. Lastly, the paper for the Whitelines Link notebook is fountain pen friendly so you do not have to worry about bleedthrough and you can write on the back of each page. Need more copy paper? It doesn't require any special paper or ink type, and the scans become PDF files that can be combined, loaded into Evernote or Dropbox, etc.My bottom line:  This is a good idea, but it's not very well implemented here. And why can't I use my much cheaper paper I already have and take a photo of that with my Apple devices. It'd be nice to save paper if you could use both sides of the paper with the app, but since the guides are only on one side, it's going to work on one side of the paper.Regarding the App:- The app is free.- I hoped that it had character recognition, but it doesn't. The paper is better quality that I have seen on most note pads. You can tear the paper into quarters, or even just tear the corners off, and position the markers at the corners of whatever you want to scan. This paper worked fine for me, but the benefit it provides me is not worth what it cost. To get around that somewhat, I tried photocopying the paper to see if that would work. It may help you align the paper for taking a picture, but it doesn't solve zoom/blur issues very well.- You can get better results with a simple scanner- Only includes 40 sheets- Not the best size- Firm flap makes it difficult to take notes (it's always getting in the way)Overall: even if was just a simple notepad, I'd give it a low rating. The awkward flat and poor paper quality makes it inferior to even the cheapest pad at the dollar store.
