I will say though that the box for these folders is a feather weight at best, in that it fell apartment once I took it out the shipment box. This box of Smead Heavyweight "SuperTab" folders consists of 50 letter-size folders with 1/3-cut tabs in yellow, green, blue and red. The box claims they are 4X stronger, followed by an asterisk. When I got my box in the mail, it was raining hard outside. The box sat outside for a few hours in the rain. You notice immediately how much heavier a box of these file folders is than a box of regular paper file folders. Each box contains fifty folders in four bright colors (red, yellow, green, and blue). SMEAD SUPER-TAB HEAVYWEIGHT FOLDERS, LETTER SIZE, box of 50 can be a godsend if you have suddenly found yourself in the center of an archiving/filing job as I recently did. This box of 50 heavyweight folders will be an asset to an office that still uses file folders. I intend to donate a box of these folders to my local elementary school. I recently purchased a box of folders from Staples and was shocked to get them home and see how flimsy they were. This box is the letter size file folders, so make sure your file container or cabinet is designed for letter size rather than legal size if you want a good fit. Admittedly, I was surprised (and disappointed) initially when I first opened the box and discovered that they weren't as thick and heavy as I expected - they're certainly not more than double the weight of an ordinary folder, if that.
