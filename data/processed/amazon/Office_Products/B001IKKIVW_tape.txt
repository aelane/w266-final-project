Since the tape is installed in a cassette you can switch between sizes as needed.The only downside I see to the unit is the 1.5 cm bit of labelling tape that is snipped off every time you make a label. I may just be lucky, but so far the tape has not jammed on me once, knock on wood, a frequent occurrence with prior models I've used.It's a bit pricey, but I think it'd be worth it for anyone who likes being organized, and whose handwriting, like mine, is indecipherable. The tape isn't too expensive, though, and comes in a good variety of styles.Lastly, the printer comes with a USB cord, which is nice. I still think it should waste less tape and only cut off a small sliver of blank tape (if it really has to at all), but that is really my only complaint. You can see how much tape is left in your spool and the automatic cutter works very well.In all, the P-Touch is a versatile tool that will quickly have you wanting (nay, needing) to label everything around your house and with the massive array of label types that you can order, the sky's the limit. It still wastes about 1.5cm tape at the beginning of each print. There is even tape available that can be ironed onto clothing.the program that come with the label maker allows import of various logo's, as well as gif files and pictures.the nice thing about this model is that you can put batteries in it, and switch it to &#34;internal&#34; program and use it away from home with a laptop and the internal label program it has. tape loss for each print job. The wasted tape issue can be worked around though, if you have to print several labels at once, by setting the label maker to chain print the labels, then only the very first time a one-inch leader will be cut, and all labels after that will be printed and cut without additional tape waste. It was easy to figure out how to put the tape in and to set it up.With the software already on the label maker, it can print out very simple labels. All in all, it does what it is advertised, if only it can cut back on spitting out wasted tape. I sucks that it wastes some tape, but w/e.

The tape seems to be laminated and this gives it strength and durability.

I suppose with the acid free tape I could use it for scrapbooking, but the acid free tapes only come in black on clear or black on white, so it is limited in colors.

wide tape which has, so far, has worked well for me.
