I use it in scrapbooking and cardmaking all the time but also when I want to glue something quickly as this is a breeze. We use it all the time and never regret giving up the double-sided tape. Since it's glue, I had an easier time adjusting and flattening the poster than I did with tape. Only time will tell. Oh, the time & headaches it would've saved me...well, maybe I'm exaggerating just a tiny bit, but I envy all you craftaholics who are out there now...cause theScotch Adhesive Dot Roller, 0.33 x 49 Feet (6055)is awesome! It also takes no time at all to dry (I wouldn't even really say that the dots are damp...just sticky). I won't know how long it stands up over time (scrapbooks you want to have for decades) but for school projects it isn't a problem. And I'm definitely going to invest in a few to use when it's time to wrap Christmas presents this winter! Over time the adhesion may become permanent, but I did not test that. This came at a wonderful time.

Now while those both work well, they do take a bit more time to apply and can sometimes be messy.

Mine arrived just in time for me to decorate for my newly five year old daughter's fairy-themed birthday party, and I found many, many uses for it, some quite unexpected.

I've been scrapbooking for a long time and I've always found the double-sided runner tapes from similar dispensers to be invaluable.
