This little roll is precisely what I'm trying to make - a little label that needs to be removable at will. I already used up my first roll and will certainly order more. This is a roll of paper tape with a built-in cutter (like a roll of scotch tape). The roll format fits in a drawer better than a sheet of labels, and it means you can choose the length of label you need.Likes:- Stores easily in a drawer.- Can cut any length.- Built-in cutter.- High visibility.- Easy to write on.- Removable if you don't wait too long.Dislikes:- More expensive than, say, masking tape.Overall, I prefer this to using something like masking tape, as it is more compact and has the built-in cutter. We use this roll a lot. This works just like a roll of tape. This "roll" is quite a workhorse. Even now, I have a roll in a drawer next to my computer. The roll is 1" wide and 58' long - that's a lot of labels.At first I didn't like the color... bright green, but actually it makes for a very visible label. The are about equal.The roll is nice because you can make the label any length you want. It's exactly what you expect--post-it on a roll. I am impressed enough to buy another roll for our family and perhaps a stocking stuffer for Christmas. Keeping the roll handy lends itself to many uses. Post-it Super Sticky Removeable Label Roll is a roll of 1-inch-wide sticky blank paper on a plastic tape dispenser and you can cut it however long you like. I realize this is just a roll of labels, but I'm amazed someone didn't think of doing this sooner. This roll of stick-on removable labels is eminently handy. It works like a roll of tape, you can cut it to any length you need, and it is easy to stick to any smooth surface, easy to write on, easy to remove. Get yourself a roll, you'll see. Love this roll of tape! Exactly what you'd think it would be - it's just like a roll of sticky tape and as easy to use, but it sticks and re-sticks like a Post-it. I do not personally write very large (nor very tiny) so this roll turned out to feel... well, wasteful. So basically  this roll isn't suited for everyone. This is a roll of Post-it note - removable sticky-label, on paper, so that you can write on it (much more easily than the plastic labels). This particular roll is kind of a neon green, which makes it highly visible.Personally, I would have chosen a more subtle shade of color, but that's not really a problem. I keep a roll in several different places -- office, storage room, craft room, even in the laundry room for when I want to leave signs and notes on the freezer door about what's inside for my significant other. Just roll, stick, label and later, remove. It looks like a large roll of scotch tape only better. My roll is currently in the kitchen for marking containers....but will use for lots of projects. It is a one-inch wide roll of post-it note paper. This is essentially a continuous roll of PostIt material with a super-strong backing adhesive. I plan always to have a roll on hand. It is dispensed out of a roll that has a plastic serrated edge like you would find on gift wrap tape. I love this roll of tape - it is easier to write on (compared to masking tape), comes on a roll which makes it easy for me to cut (or I can tear off), plus there is a lot on the roll.
