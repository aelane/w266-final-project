Our board has had a slight red cast to it, and the spray did get it white again. If you have a pretty new board, you don't need to use the cleaner. A four by six foot white board has been on the wall of my office for years. As easy as the white board is to use, I still miss the look of the old slate chalk boards. Until now, I have been usingExpo white board markerson my board. They write well on the board, but I don't know whether or not it's my white board that's the issue or the markers or the cleanser, but they're difficult to erase cleanly.The cleanser - this cleanser works wonders on erasing difficult to erase marks, or marks left over by other markers of mine written over weeks ago. I use a white board daily in my homeschooling and this cleaner and eraser gets my very dirty board looking almost new. I have a large old white board at my work, and it has never really looked "clean". It gets my white board really nice and clean looking.

It glided easily over the board and a huge plus is that the eraser is refillable so when it gets too far gone, I can get a replacement.Spray cleaner:  By far the most valuable piece of this entire unit as the markers do stain sooner rather than later.

On a board that someone had decorated a couple of months ago with a Christmas theme, it got a lot off, but not everything.

I don't think the board looked that clean when it was brand new.Overall, it's a nice starter pack.
