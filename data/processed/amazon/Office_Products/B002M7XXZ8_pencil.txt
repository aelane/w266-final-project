I also used a pencil on the surface. But I was able to write legibly with both pen and #2 pencil. If you use a pencil, you can erase it, too. I could even erase the pencil marks. I find that the pencil marks don't come off completely due to the textured writing surface. I tested pencil, as that is what I will likely use to write on these with and the pencil writing can be erased completely. All worked well, but I found pencil to be the most useful -- you can erase your notes, and reuse the tab elsewhere.I've been using mine to mark sections of my home-owners association CC&Rs; and by-laws -- I was just appointed treasurer and I need to make sure I can find the legalities quickly, and make my own notes where needed. Finally, I tested my 0.4mm drafting pencil and it actually wrote much better than my pen; better color and smoother line. The pencil also erased cleanly with no destruction to the Note Tab. The pencil & erasable gel pen (the latter is erased with a rubber "nub" on the end of the pen via the heat of friction) both erased completely & the erased spot could be easily written over. I wrote on them with a pencil and was able to erase as well.
