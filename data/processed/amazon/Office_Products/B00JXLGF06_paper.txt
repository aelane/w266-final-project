That still means I seldom have to reload the paper tray. The Xerox refuses to feed paper that's not straight out of the package. The paper tray is a little awkward and even a bit flimsy...the cover for it seems to fall off every time I use it. Even if the the WF-3640 were $20-$40 more, I would still get the WF-3640 to get double the paper capacity and the larger touch screen control panel on the front.This WF-3620 is a fantastic printer, but I have some qualms with it.First the good:* The print quality is great. * Disappointed with the paper trays. But truthfully, I haven't had paper jams with a WorkForce printer, so I'm quite pleased with this printer after several weeks of use!Scanning was easy and is wireless. If you need dual paper trays, then get the WF-3640.With that being said, for 2014, the best Epson WorkForce printer I have reviewed and is simply the best WorkForce printer is the WF-7610/7620. It is about $50+ more but you can utilize larger paper sizes and the scanner is much bigger. Grabs paper easy and had no issues at all. Plain paper copies are very hard to tell apart from original (original was rumpled, so that was a dead giveaway). The paper capacity of 250 is too low for high-volume office or home use. You may want to consider getting the WF-3640 however, due to the larger paper tray (500 instead of 250).After a month of regular use we have not yet had to replace ink, so I cannot speak to how quickly the ink runs out. First this only has one paper tray. The paper tray holds half a ream of paper. It has a real paper cartridge that keeps the paper flat and perfect (as compared to printers where the paper lays at an angle in the back and gets warped before you print). I'm guessing this would be greatly better on photo paper, but I didn't have any at the time of this review to test. Even on regular paper, they absolutely blow away the output from the laser printers.Connectivity. It's definitely quick.The rear paper tray for special media only holds one envelope or sheet of card stock at a time so be aware that while it handles those things perfectly, you will need to feed them individually, one at a time.One disappointment for me was that Epson includes what they labeled as Initial Print Cartridges. It does have a much smaller paper tray, so I will have to fill it more frequently, but for my home use, this is not a big deal.The touchscreen is very easy to follow and use. Not as good as on premium paper, but fine for home use.
