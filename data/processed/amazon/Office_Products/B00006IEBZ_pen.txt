I LOVE this pen. I almost hate to be this excited about a pen, but I am. This pen is great as far as gel pens go. If you lend out this pen to someone, keep your eyes on it as you might not get it back! I've had this pen for several years but have only really been using it heavy duty since June, 2012, for almost six months now. I have used this pen for over 4 years, probably more. I absolutely love this pen and would recommend to anyone who likes smooth writing. When my Dr recomended this pen to me and told me to wrap one of my address lables around the barrel, I thought he was kidding (he said it would walk away from my desk). On the average one pen will last me about 3 years of daily use before something breaks or falls apart (usually the area where the pen unscrews towards the middle). The pen is larger than most, but the size makes it easier to write and hold onto. The ONLY pen I have ever insisted on keeping.

This pen is my absolute favorite and for so many reasons, the nice soft grip (recommended by the arthritis foundation), the super smooth writing and the pretty mauve metallic barrel, sure to keep hubby from making this his favorite pen too....no worries though, they come in a lot of other great colors too!

I use this pen for everything from journaling to scrapbooking to letters.
