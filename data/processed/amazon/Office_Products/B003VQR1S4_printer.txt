With that being said, not having to have the printer close enough to my computer for the USB cable to reach is fantastic.Software:The software is not very impressive but adequate. Low and behold, this printer at $59, including ink and wireless features was a no brainer.The installation was a breeze on my Toshiba Windows 7 PC. Finally a printer that doesn't make you buy this separately. I guess it depends on how efficient the printer will be over the long run in its use of the color cartridge vs. previous models.Replacements:Canon PG-210 XL Cartridge (Black) = about $17Canon CL-211 XL Cartridge (Color) = about $225) Scanning = disappointed. My old printer (MP520) is mostly a flat grey silver, but this nice high glossy printer looks sleek.OVERALL:- Much of the "features" highlighted are so-so software driven enhancements.- I love how it's wireless!- I don't see why scanning couldn't be made wireless too, but with the right 3rd party software the quality and manipulation of the scan are good.- Only time will tell if the move to a single color cartridge will be less or more expensive.- I'm overall happy with the speed and quality. This printer is a good printer for the money. But again, a wireless all-in-one printer for this price is a good deal. Our most expensive personal printer at that time cost $3,000; printed at 600 dpi; and it did nothing but print in black. A really good printer like you would have in an office cost much more and printed at maybe 1200 dpi.Thirteen years later we have the Canon PIXMA MP495. Without it, this printer would still be an outrageously good deal, and scanner without the printing would also be an outrageously good deal.As someone who has mounds of old photographs in his closet, I can't help but appreciate the ability to save them all digitally and toss all that paper. Canon is aiming this printer at owners of EOS SLR Cameras, claiming wireless capability, yet not including the assumed basic feature of duplex printing? I wouldn't want to have purchased an additional printer for convenience only, just to have it expensive to run.I'm not having a noise problem. I don't think I would use a printer in this price/feature range for a workhorse but, for moderate home use, it gets the job done. This is a good printer. The printer works well with other programs e.g.

The PIXMA MP495 is a fine printer with all-in-one features and WiFi capabilities.

I have not owned the printer long enough to verify the accuracy of their claim.Scanning:I don't scan very often, but it's a very useful feature to have when you need it.

But since the printer has no controls on the device itself for configuring the connection to your likely secured WiFi access point, it must be configured through software installed on one of the computers on the network.
