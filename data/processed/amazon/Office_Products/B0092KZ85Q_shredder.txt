But this shredder is wonderful because it is much more powerful and doesn't get stuck when I stuff it with unopened envelopes, unlike the others. This is a great compact shredder if you don't have the space for an industrial strength unit. And I feel that this shredder is very adequate for that job. My old shredder would only do one sheet at a time, so I'm very happy with 7.The other thing I love about it is they way it looks. Our old shredder basically looked like a trash can, but this sits sideways and really kind of looks like a computer sitting by our desk. The first shredder I've owned that I didn't have to baby. Update 11/5/2013: I have been using this shredder for about 6 months. This shredder has a small opening and even my 2 year old couldn't fit her fingers in the slot, which is nice. I'm so glad I have this cross-cut shredder that I can put in several whole sheets or thin unopened envelopes and it zips right though them. We were very pleased to get this new shredder and to to find how well it works. Runs so much quieter and more smoothly than our previous shredder.... This Fellowes shredder is replacing an older model, which has served me well for many years. Unlike my old shredder, it will tell me with a light when that happens.The top comes off easily for emptying. I purchased this shredder after my 8-sheet Aurora bit the dust. My last shredder said it could handle 8 sheets, but clearly couldn't. I use the shredder for small shredding batches and it seems like it will hold up well. This shredder is excellent for moderate household use. Our shredder died a bit ago and we are drowning in mail. It did not groan as our older shredder had done. The shredder groaned and painfully chugged along. The shredder will shut down in that instance.

The shredder's noise output is about what I would expect, neither super loud or super quiet.

Any shredder makes it impossible for someone to take your old checks and "just use them".

This shredder turns a full sheet of paper into about 400 pieces.
