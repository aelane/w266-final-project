And this tape is geared for lighter jobs. This tape unrolls very nice. This is good, sturdy tape, and I think it's a good product - but it's a thinner than I like to use. So, I suggest Scotch's 142 tape for this class of tape due to the extra width. For even sturdier tape, I suggest Scotch filament or bi-directional filament (for very heavy packages) tape. I love keeping tape around the house for when I need it. I was pleased to hear back that the tape acquitted itself well in its role of keeping the packages securely closed.~A_E~ This tape is fine. It is difficult to do so, and may warp the tape a bit, and the oils in your fingers reduce the gripping ability &#8211;so I recommend cutting it with scissors. This is decent tape. This tape does tear by hand but not as easily as masking tape or painters tape. I normally use 2 inch wide tape and this stuff works just as well for most applications. I have heard that also means your tape is thicker and this is thick tape. Although the tape itself is just an inch wide, it comes on a three inch core, so it can be used in a tape gun or similar tape dispenser which makes it much easier to work with.It has a distinct yellow color when you look at the roll, but the tape itself is clear when applied.No complaints at all &#8211; great (albeit pricey) tape. It doesn't look like there is that much tape on the roll but there is. The tape is really strong and fairly adhesive. This tape can be used for many different things and its heat resistant up to 300 degrees. This is great tape, but it is overkill for many household jobs. This tape, however, adheres well and can stand heat up to 300 degrees. I really like this tape, the color orange gives it an unexpected unique look, and even though I do not anticipate to test it up to temperatures of 300 degrees, it is always a plus to know the capability is there. As to how I cut this tape, I must say I always use scissors to do the cutting, but sometimes the old faithful teeth, if speed is of an essence, either way the tape is thin but sturdy, easy to cut, and once used is apparent that any packing job is secure. I find this tape sturdy, and half in between the wider formats like regular packing tape, so the uses for this Scotch Light Duty Packaging Tape 610 Clear Heat Resistant, are plenty and varied. It is not a cheap-type tape that you can buy three at a time in a flimsy dispenser. You wouldn't use this tape to gift wrap with. I've been using this tape to box up Christmas gifts and eBay sales for shipping, and it works great. With this tape, I just need a few small pieces at the seams to hold things together.The price might seem a little high, but at 1 in x 72 yards, this roll gives you a lot more tape than you would get from the regular packing tape with the plastic dispensers. The tape as marketed as &#34;easy to tear&#34; - with a sharp blade. This is a very nice, strong tape. It feels like the tape of years past and the amber color reminded me of the days I spent in Dad's office, trying to be his secretary. This tape holds, but be forewarned that it is not removable tape. It's a good tape and because it is on a large core so that it can be used in my tape gun, it will have a lot of use in this place. The tape holds and it holds well.Overall, this is a well made roll of tape and has found its special place in the house to handle almost any and all tape jobs that require wider and stronger applications.One aside if I may. This tape is perfect for smaller applications. Still, this is an excellent tape, and it has a three hundred degree temperature rating, so it can withstand the most sweltering of attics.This one-inch tape is perfectly suitable for my small package needs. I used this tape to package up my boxes for my last move- It did a great job keeping everything together- Very sturdy and strong- On some boxes I had to use a knife to take the boxes apart, it is very strong! This is excellent tape for sealing packages or manilla envelopes, the main uses I have for it. I always try to buy Scotch tape for every need. I have been using this tape for shipping small boxes with USPS. This tape is only 1 inch across which is JUST enough to provide coverage for a light weight item. You will want your tape to be 100% clear, and this tape is not 100% clear. The tape will be slightly yellowish when used on white surfaces or on white/light colored gift wrapping. While this tape may be more expensive than what you are used to using, you will notice the difference.The tape is very easy to work with and sticks very well on nearly every surface and even in recent weather extremes. Though not clear, the tape has only a slight yellowish tint noticeable against white backgrounds. This tape is not 1&#34; wide, I get 7/8&#34;. I think this tape would hold but I like more width over taped seams. This is strong tape, tears easily with dispenser, holds well. We don't need to double tape our boxes.We can't tear the tape with our fingers so we purchased the following tape dispenser to make this very easy to use:Scotch Heavy Duty Dispenser C25This Scotch tape dispenser is nice and heavy and we can use just one hand to pull and cut the tape.Here's a less costly tape dispenser, which I probably would have purchased if I had seen it first:Tartan Tabletop Tape Dispenser HB900 Black, 1 in This is a strong tape that I have used on packages I have mailed in conjunction with packing tape. I found I almost had to twist the tape slightly and pull it rather than tear it. I think 3M makes the best tape around, and this packing tape is no exception. I found the tape fairly easy to dispense. The tape has fairly admirable stickiness and will stick to things it touches and can leave a residue on light colored surfaces, so think about what you are intending to use it for and whether it will need to eventually be removed. Scotch always makes great tape. Overall, I'm quite satisfied with this tape and it holds the packaging in well. I was pleased to find that this tape exceeded my low expectations by a wide margin. I mounted the tape on my standard 3M tape dispense. I found this tape worked just as well as my normal 2 inch rolls. Scotch Light Duty Packaging Tape is good tape! I then pulled it off and this tape was much harder to remove from the cardboard than the other no-name packing tape. I often add extra tape to packages simply because I don't trust them. I would not do that with this tape because it feels so strong and sticky. However, I would not hesitate to use this tape my packages. Nothing special, just very good tape for packing presents or mailing parcels.One inch wide and a good sized roll, which makes it good value.Good adhesive and staying power. It is a thick tough tape with excellent adhesion. It is not a tape in which you will lose the end and spend time and frustration peeling off slivers of tape to finally get the end. This tape is strong and sturdy--exactly what I needed for shipping boxes. Scotch tape is  very useful for packaging small packages and wrapping presents. This 3M tape is high quality. I mostly use 2&#34; 3M with tape guns, but thought to reduce cost a bit and be good to the environment by using this smaller tape for the labels. This tape is perfect for sealing boxes for moving too.
