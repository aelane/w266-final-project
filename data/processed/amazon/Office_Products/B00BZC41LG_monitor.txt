Well, this monitor list was the perfect answer! I have my Acer 24" monitor sitting on this and it fits perfectly with no flex.Aesthetics wise, Fellowes should go one more step and do away with the grey/gray color branding on the riser and go with a slightly more subdued (if that fits) etched lettering. The monitor seemed unsteady lifted on books, and my chair just didn't adjust to a height where I was comfortable with both monitor and keyboard. I was SO disappointed, as I was excited that I was going to get my Samsung monitor up a few inches higher for my back, shoulders and neck health. When I remove the monitor from the lift and place it directly on the table, the monitor does not wobble, so the effect is amplified by the construction of the lift. If you have a large monitor and table that transmits vibrations like mine, your monitor may wobble when you use it. The monitor lift seems to be very sturdy, and stands like a rock. My 19" monitor stands on it nicely, and I can see it much better now it is higher. I like using monitor stands for a few reasons. It is sturdy, and holds an LCD monitor well. My 20" Acer monitor has an 8" x 8" base that fits perfectly on the riser with lots of room to spare on either side. This lifts up a monitor so it's easier to view on a desk. This monitor stand is solid and well made. I like this monitor lift a lot. It raises my monitor to a perfect level to reduce the stress on my neck and shoulders.The monitor stand is wide enough to accommodate most monitors. You need to make sure that your monitor base isn't wider than 14 inches, or it will not fit in the monitor lift.I had hoped it would work with my HP All-In-One but this lift is too small for those devices. I have a 29-inch monitor (and yes, it's under 25 pounds...it's about 20 lbs) and I was looking forward to opening up a little desk space. It gets the monitor up at eye level, which helps my neck and keeps me from slouching. My monitor fits flat between the curved ends. My monitor base does not fit on it solidly so I can't really use it. Raising the monitor does two things for the user. Obviously, it puts the monitor at a better height for better ergonomics, but by using the open design, Fellows has made it possible to stash stuff under the stand. This monitor lift has rubber on the 4 bottom corners for stability, so it doesn't slide or move around.The main thing you need to know is to make certain your monitor base is no wider than 12 inches and not deeper than 8 inches, so it fits on the curved base.
