They aren't as aromatic as most white board pens and the have good coverage. They write well, even on a board that's covered in finger grease, which many other dry-erase pens have trouble with. What I'd written on the board remained and I compared the colors with my new Quartet EnduraGlide Fine Tip Dry-Erase Markers. I have a small white board that I keep in my kitchen for writing notes and the EnduraGlide work fine for that purpose. (I occasionally clean my white board off with a baby wipe, which works great.) This Quartet EnduraGlide Dry Erase Markers are really nice, especially if you are using them for a personal white board. They were actually dry-erase, but if left on the white board they just didn't erase that well typically requiring me to pull out the miracle spray cleaner to get the ink off the board.I've not had the time to really see how erasable these markers really are, but I will hopefully come back later and update that information once some additional time has passed.Smell wise, I would note that these were certainly less irritating to get a whiff of compared to the competing products. I have a dry-erase board in my office where I track important project facts.

When I teach, I like to use the white board (rather than relying solely on powerpoint presentations).

I keep a dry board and use the board and the pens to play Hangman...

These are better than my last generic white board markers I had.
