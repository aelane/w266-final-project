It is fairly priced and the only sharpener you will ever need or want to use. Depending on how much you want to spend, this sharpener would probably be adequate for use in most homes, but I honestly don't have faith that it will be very long lived. I want them sharp but I don't want a sharpener that's going to whittle too far down each time and cause me to buy pencils more often. The X-Acto SharpX classic sharpener is a most welcome addition to our home office. I don't think I've ever had an electric sharpener that produced such pointy pencils. I tested this sharpener out on Smencils and regular pencils. I was skeptical at first because it's pretty light compared to the old heavy sharpener I had before. It is a very simple electric sharpener. This X-ACTO sharpener does well with its primary task - which is getting pencils sharp. This sharpener is half the size of that one, so the four non-slip disks at the bottom are able to do their job pretty well. This is a relatively low-end sharpener, lightly built with a small motor, but I am surprised by how well it is working so far. this is a great sharpener i love it it sharpens the pencils perfect every time i would recommend this for anyone weather it be an office or for home use this is a wonderful sharpener and a great gift for anyone anyone who gets this sharpener will love it it was worth every penny i paid for it

No sharpener has been better than the one my father brought back from Japan while on a business trip when I was a kid.

I'm grateful for this free one, and this sharpener may be decent enough to deserve a 3-star if I didn't have some standards for an electric pencil sharpener, but honestly, I don't like it very much.

I'm sorely missing my old sharpener right now.
