I use a wavy keyboard so it's not a perfect fit, but the rest is still comfortable, and the unit is very usable. Other keyboard trays that mount and stay under the desk are too low for a transcriptionest to use because using the pedal causes them to hit their knees on the top. When you adjust the keyboard on this one, the fixed full sized wrist support is always in the proper place. This keyboard tray setup solves all of that. Once installed, wherever you adjust your keyboard in the height setting, it will stay there. So with all of that, you have an ideally adjustable keyboard height, and angle, so you can fine tune it to your bodies delight. So having the ultimate in keyboard adjustment is critical.Think of the real problem in using a keyboard continually. This keyboard tray is more sturdy and well-made than others I have used in the past. Anyway I did have my keyboard up their which is a bad idea but I couldn't find a sturdy keyboard tray that fits in the corner.This Tray is a godsend. The keyboard tilt feature was nice, my son used it while he was leaning back in (ruining, ha) the office chair and found it useful, but it wasn't something I would use.Overall, this was a sturdy, very nice product, one that added some nice features to our desk, once we got over a few little details that weren't present with our old keyboard tray. The keyboard tray is high quality, and seems built to last. You dont have to bend and slump over when you can bring the keyboard to you. This keyboard tray can easily be installed on the corner (like shown in the picture), or on the parallel. This is an excellent keyboard shelf. After typing with my keyboard on top of my desk for almost 20 years, I thought I'd give the Keyboard Holder a try. Actually, the keyboard, which now extend via the slider attached to the underside of the desk, is closer to my hands and set lower, both of which make the keyboard much more accessible and keep me from having to lean forward and down.It's surprising how much difference keyboard position can make, especially if you're prone to back problems. The Fellowes Professional Executive Adjustable Tray is my third keyboard tray (that has not come pre-installed) and my second from Fellowes. It fit my keyboard well, but will little room to spare. You need this keyboard tray if your desk's height does not allow upright comfortable back posture or your wrists & fingers feel the strain or people of different heights work at the desk or you just need some more room on the desk.This keyboard tray requires installation by getting under the table and attaching telescopic glide tray track by screws to the underside of your desk.

The keyboard platform can slide in and out of the track as needed and comes with a thick layer of heavy grease to allow it to slide back and forth easily.

A keyboard no longer than nine inches is ideal.Most desks built today seem stuck in the last century so a good, ergonomic keyboard tray is a must.

I needed to get my keyboard off my desk and this seemed to be a good solution.
