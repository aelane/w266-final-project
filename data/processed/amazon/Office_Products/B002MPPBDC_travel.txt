The travel organizer looks good, however I don&#8217;t know how practical it is going to be. This travel organizer has 3 dividers and the pocket. I'm not too sure how good it would be for personal travel, as it wouldn't fit in my purse and I wouldn't want to carry it. This travel organizer works well for those that still print out planes tickets, hotel reservations, car rentals, etc.It measures 10 x 11.5 inches, so it can hold most paper printouts with the exception of any legal size paper, unless you fold it.It is completed made of plastic with 3 clear dividers and a clear velcro-secured pouch in the front. The travel travel organizer is a great idea. This certainly is not enough for any but the thinnest travel guide. However, I'm glad that Smead packaged two of these travel organizers together, since the one thing I don't like about this product is that it isn't very sturdy. Pricey but I like these for travel.

We received the travel organizer 2 days before a scheduled trip to Washington, DC, and it is proving to be a great help.We have our plane tickets, event tickets and show tickets in advance and this planner has pockets that will accommodate items of different sizes.

Right.I used to just stuff all my travel related junk - tickets, address, maps, reservation confirmation numbers for hotels and cars - into a manila folder on trips.

The Smead travel organizer includes two letter size folders, and a small ticket-sized velcro-closure pouch.
