I'm a big fan of Logitech products, so I was anxious to try this one out. The fan is very quiet (I'll have to remind myself to turn it off), and it not only keeps the computer cool, it also circulates a little air to your legs so your lap doesn't get overheated. The fan is nice and silent while still moving a pretty decent amount of air, the speakers were nice and loud didn't really notice much of a difference in my laptop's battery life either, which is a big plus.Problems? The fan is very quiet and turns off automatically when you turn the computer off. (You can also turn off the fan manually) Two rubber tabs are included to raise the computer even more to let additional air circulate.The base raises the laptop to a comfortable level for typing and viewing the screen whether you're using it on your lap or setting it on the floor. He happily tested out the cooling fan feature on this lapdesk and reports that it works well. I bought this specifically for the fan. One can disable the fan and speakers, though, to save one's computer battery.I have no complaints about this desk. You can turn the fan on or off, control the volume, and mute the speakers using the controls.With the USB cord attached to the lapdesk, there's no danger of misplacing the cord.Two lift up pieces on the unit keep the computer secure on the lapdesk.At first I was disappointed with the quality of the lapdesk's speakers. What's even more stunning is the fan's nearly inaudible operation. The fan is pure heaven--I can't even hear it. The fan noise is hardly noticeable, and it keeps the computer cool enough. There isn't a light on to show you the fan is running; though there is a red light on when you have the speakers on mute.
