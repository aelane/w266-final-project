The files are a mellow soft shade of green (the box calls it "moss"), including the attached tabs. However, unlike some other files, this one is not reinforce with plastic coating at top and bottom... that's the one improvement I would make.I also like the fact that the pockets are made with paper certified under the Sustainable Forestry Initiative and that they contain at least 10% recycled material. These would be for those files that you do not want to print tab labels for. This makes creating files faster and easier. The files expand about 2 inches. I would restrict using them for files you use a great deal. For files you access often, these folders work quite well. I have many files that are just hanging there and it is hard to keep them contained, they are not pockets.These folders are one large pocket, just put your items in the pocket and that is where they stay.

as "suspense files" to hold documents that are in process, or awaiting additional information.

When redoing my files, I think I'd actually prefer a box of all the same color.

If I continue to prefer these, I'll probably use them for all of my files in the future.These are great, sturdy, well-designed folders that give a unified look to my file drawer.
