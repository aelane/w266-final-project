After using them, I could see this size would be necessary for certain types of documents; however, I think the sticky side could be cut down a bit so it doesn't take up quite as much room.As advertised, the sticky portion does not remove text. The size is adequate for most purposes. I definitely prefer this size over the round edge NoteTabs, also because the rectangular tab offers more writing space than the rounded edge ones. You could conceivably use them anywhere you might use a Post-it; they are a handy size, they stick well, and are easy to remove; although their intended use is for books and notebooks. The size helps allow the tabs to stick securely and gives plenty of room to write. The size of the NoteTabs (3 X 3.5) are a little larger than I am used to, but I find this size to be unexpectedly useful and convenient. I also like the bigger size since it gives me more room to write than those little ones I usually get. This particular size has 2 inches of writing space on the tab itself but a ton more room (3" x 3")down on the stick-on portion. I feel this size (3" x 3.5") is a good size for marking pages in smaller books, just using as a divider, or pointing to items on smaller pages...but if you have a larger page and want to point to specific items, go with the larger size as you can tear them at the perforates and make them smaller.In short, a total MUST for any college student, clerical worker, or sticky-note addict like myself. They are this size of a square Post-It note (3"x3.5") but it isn't really long enough to highlight a line of text. The large size does allow a solid hold, however.This seems to be a quality product with no flaws and good performance. This particular size and configuration just seems to be a solution looking for a problem. It is the same size as a "medium" PostIt Note (i.e., 3" x 3"), with the addition of the 1/2" index tab. )5) The size of the tabs, 3"x3 1/2", allows them to be used in anything from text books to day-planners to notebooks.The reason I gave four stars instead of five stars is because you can only write on one side of the tab's tip, so you can't read tabs set on a left-sided page.Still, I recommend these to anyone who loves every detail to be organized.
