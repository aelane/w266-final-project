This little product is a fair example of why I started buying 3M stock thirty years ago. I admit I was skeptical about this product. I definitely recommend this product. This product is not something I 'needed', but I appreciate the convenience of having a dispenser of the precut Scotch tape. With a few product tweaks, it would be a fantastic buy.There is no sticky stuff on the bottom of this product. I just don't really find this product useful. This product is convenient though. As such, I cannot really recommend this product for everyone. I wouldn't normally review a product such as this, but since I received it via the Vines program, I am obligated.The tape strips are indeed convenient, but the dispenser, not so much... This product's deskgrip dispenser makes it very convenient to wrap gifts or tape other items. However, while this product makes the process more convenient, the user will have to pay the price for this convenience. This product gets an A+ for convenience, but I can't help but wonder if it's worth the cost of the refills. Overall I would recommend this product as a tape dispenser which can double as an amusing distraction for slow days at the office or home. ...This is still a fairly useful little product. If this product worked perfectly, I might have given it one more star, but it didn't. This is a great product, do not make the mistake of judging it by price. Another great product from Scotch brand. This is an incredibly ingenious and useful product. This product is an all around winner, for a number of different reasons. While I think this product is more expensive than the standard roll of tape, it's a great tape dispenser for children who have issues w/ figuring out how much tape to pull for their asundry projects. It would be a much better product if it stuck vertically and to any surface type. This product is more expensive than traditional dispensers, as the refills are much smaller than a tape roll. I love this product. Good product. A good product, in my opinion. I was so excited to try this product, it seems like such an excellent idea and I would not longer have to cut tape myself. I like this product as it is convenient and ingenious.Convenient because you have pre-cut tape in just the right length for just about any wrapping or mending need. I love a product designed to offer a clear advantage over the market leader, but unfortunately this tape dispenser does not fit the description. I am sure this product would be helpful for the elderly and the disabled as well.Although this is a nice product, I don't think we need it. But upon using the product, I was impressed that it *did* hold tightly to the flat surface, while still being easy to remove if necessary.The dispenser releases one 2-inch strip at a time. This product makes it a breeze to quickly and efficiently provide you with the right amount of tape (in most cases) for any project. lol  The product is good so I would have given it 5 stars but because of the price vs quanity I cannot give it more than three stars. Who knew that a little product from Scotch Tape could be a marriage helper? First, this product is given four stars simply because it works as advertised. While I do not find the product astounding or extremely useful, it does work and it for those that might need the product that's all that matters. I was expecting it to just pop right off but the product stayed on my desk securely through several times pulling the tape. I give this product four stars. I don't use tape too much but this is a great product. So when I saw this new product, I was truly a happy camper. I like this product because with me, the edge of the tape usually gets pressed down on the roll, making it basically invisible and, once I do find the edge, very difficult to peel back. The product contained within is perfect for most applications. All in all, it is a great product. This is a product I never would have  bought, but I received gratis through the Amazon Vine program.It's a nifty little pod-like affair, very ergonomically designed, that sits on your desk and quickly dispenses small pieces of tape.Frankly, I have never thought tearing bits of scotch tape a hardship, but now that this cheerful gadget sits nearby, I have the luxury of taping things effortlessly...at least, until they invent a mini-robot to do it for me. The product is nice, but a bit unnecessary. I didn't care for this product right from the time I started to try and figure out how to load it, the cover was quite difficult to slide open and the unit slides around on smooth surfaces like formica. This is a very inventive product and great for any desk. This is a great product, especially for wrapping gifts. The product is further improved in that it has a rubber base that creates a kind of suction on a clean smooth surface. Now that I've used the product for a while I am more pleased with it than when I first wrote this review. However, after using the product I've decided I kind of like it. Pretty disappointing product... Nice product and handy. This product doesn't make it any easier to do so.I also have no problem cutting off the length I want, so having uniform lengths in a dispenser is just not a big deal. This is a really terrific product. This product is great, but I'm not sure if it's really worth the price. So I give this product high marks, but suggest that you don't really bother buying it. The Scotch Pop-Up Tape Refillable Deskgrip Dispenser is a good product I will continue to use. This is a good product when all you have is one hand to tape something down, like gift wrapping, etc. Did this product reinvent the wheel? I have to admit I was a little skeptical about this product before I tried it, but after actually having used it I've come to love it.I've had to pack up a couple of fragile items with bubble wrap the last couple of days, and being able to hold the bubble wrap in place with one hand and grab a piece of tape with the other is incredibly convenient.T
