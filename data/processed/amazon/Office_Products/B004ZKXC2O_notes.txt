All the notes are 3 inches wide, with their lengths being 3, 3 1/2, 4, 4 1/2, and 5 inches long respectively. I didn't even know Avery made sticky notes. These sticky notes are tiered to allow you your choice of five different sizes of a sheet of paper. I love sticky notes! These sticky notes are different sizes but they are attached together at the top. These sticky notes stick well to whatever they are stuck to. These sticky notes are great and I will be buying more of these for the home office, kitchen, sewing room and my kid's rooms. These are really neat sticky notes. I like these sticky notes. sticky notes for subject matter or different color for different individuals in the house. These sticky notes are a rather novel idea. If you write on the first few notes, and then want to get a note under them, you have no trouble locating the note. These perform exactly the same as the 3M Post-It notes we all know and love. I loved these posted notes because they  are a unit and are perfect for sitting beside the phone or on my desk for those important messages. Leave notes for your Husband on blue, your daughter on pink, etc.Some of the things I have used my Avery Steps Sticky Notes for include: leaving notes for family, marking pages in magazines and books that I want to refer back to, as a notepad to jot down quick notes, reminder notes for myself, organizing coupons and to separate a stack of school papers into different areas (blue for history, orange for math, etc. I would definitely recommend these sticky notes. I'm glad these notes are meant to be kept together, so are much easier to keep track of and set out along with pens and highlighters. I am hooked on sticky notes. These are like all othersticky notes...they are glued across the top and when torn off it sticksto most surfaces w/your VERY important note on it...BUT...these havedifferent sizes (hence "Steps Sticky Notes")stacked one size on top ofanother in the same pad...you have 5 sizes to choose from each time youwish to leave a note. Most cheap sticky notes are worthless. I really like these better than Post-it notes because the paper is not only thicker, but they make items like this one that just work smarter. I really like these sticky notes. These Avery Steps sticky notes are a great solution.This notes pad includes five different colors and sizes. But fortunately the notes are sticky enough that I can peel one off, stick it to my desk, write on it, and then reapply it to it's final destination.I guess my only complaint is that the longer sizes are oriented differently than I'm used to. I highly recommend these sticky notes. I really like these (they're Avery notes, not Post-It brand but they are basically the same). I like these sticky notes a lot and I would give them five stars if they were a little easier to peel off (particularly the bottom colors). These notes are coveniently bundled into several different sizes (but one pad) so that the user has the choice of sizes without needing to have a bunch of different pad sizes floating around. Essentially, these notes have everything you need in an effective sticky note. Very colorful and bright sticky notes that work as well as any sticky note product. This has really made it easy to take notes and then to place them elsewhere as needed. The 150 notes are bound on one end like a paperback book.Now if you really need to have varying sizes of note pads this is certainly a good option. I often use sticky notes to mark book pages, take notes, or post a message on the fridge for other family members. I've had fun trying several of Avery's new sticky notes products lately and been pleased with them. The notes adhere well to most surfaces yet remove easily without leaving any sticky residue behind. These sticky notes are similar to brand P but instead of your standard square note, they come in a package of 5 different sizes and colors. The Avery "Steps" sticky notes make a handy, all-in-one packet for five different sizes and colors of sticky notes, but at more than $5 they strike me as a little too expensive for what you get. As sticky notes go, these are of good quality. These colored notes work great. The notes stick well to all of the services I tried without being so sticky that they leave residue on surfaces such as computer monitors. The notes are perforated on the top so they have not ripped when I detach them. When I went to reach for one of the longer notes, I'd end up having to drop everything to try and pull out the right sheet of paper without tearing it. But the notes themselves are fine, as long as you want them to stay in the pad. If you like using sticky notes in various colors to color-code documents or notes, you've probably encountered the problem of not being able to easily pull different colored notes off of a colored pad. I didn't think post-it notes could be improved upon but this is def. I love these colorful notes and the fact that they're perforated at the top for perfect tearing. These are decent sticky notes that work as well as other major brands. Where these sticky notes distinguish themselves is in their packaging. There are 30 notes of each size. 150 notes all total.Each note is perforated so that it can be removed individually without disturbing the entire set. I'm looking forward to using these notes both at work and home. Whether your notes are long or short, you've got options all in one area.All in all, an interesting and effective way of storing sticky notes. And if that happens, I'll just use two notes!Right now I buy regular size sticky notes, and I buy index size sticky notes. So as far as sticky notes go, these avery ones work better than the avery 3x3 notes. The Avery Steps Sticky notes are great because I can choose a color without having to ruin the whole pad to get to the color I want. The notes are perforated. Call me old fashioned, but I prefer to make notes with paper and pen. I love these sticky notes. New to sticky notes, at least from what I'm used to, is having perforations to tear out the sheet that you want and still have the sticky portion on it. )I really like that the largest notes are long enough to fill most of a page in my pocket-size Day-Timer, while still being vertical. Since I reposition notes quite a bit, the stickiness factor is important to me, and these just don't hold up. I love sticky notes, but hate having to dig around for the right size pad. On the Sticky Notes pack that I have, you cannot rip the notes out at the tear line without tearing the note itself. These are a little different than most other sticky notes, as you can choose the size and color, and don't have to break the pad apart. These sticky notes are everything Avery promises they will be. I assumed that these were all regular-sized sticky notes arrayed in a step configuration in the package, but they are actually different sizes with the purple being almost twice the size of the orange. I'm not sure what I'll use the larger notes for, but I'm sure they will come in handy at some point.Other than that, they're sticky notes. I really like these colorful, muli-sized notes. These sticky notes come in assorted bold colors. I love these sticky notes! The notes that adorn most desk walls and computer monitors have long been one-color-per-pad, or one-color-at-a-time layers on a single pad. All of the notes stick well. 150 notes can last me a long time, and trying to buy a stack of each size individually in the variety of colors, as well as keeping track of them, makes that impractical for me.I
