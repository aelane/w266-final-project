I put these magnets on my fridge to hang the chore list, menu list, and art work by the kids. The magnets in them are very strong and hold many papers at once. I didn't really know what to expect when I ordered these, I was skeptical about whether the magnets would be strong enough. These magnets are awesome. I bought these really strong little magnets awhile back but I can't get them off. These magnets have a great shape that makes it easy to put them on and take them off the fridge. Now aren't the cutest magnets ever??? The magnets are super strong and hold up to six regular pages at one time or other things as well. The magnets are strong but not too strong to pull off a magnetic board or refrigerator. When I saw these super strong magnets, masquerading as pushpins on Amazon, I decided to grab them. OK, they're 'fridge magnets so let's not get too excited&#8230; But the similarity to classic cork board push pins makes me smile as I look at the original art work my niece's kids make for us.A couple of thoughts - keep these and any other magnet away from your computer storage devices since they will wipe out data from a magnetic disk. These are the best little magnets I've ever had! these magnets are strong, colorful and make a great a great addition to our fridge. I got these to use with the Kikkerland Photo and Card Holder, which only comes with 8 magnets. I use the magnets to hang my kids' papers and artwork for temporary display. The tiny magnets are impossible to find by themselves. These tiny magnets are so weak they don't hold stuff to a refrigerator. What else are tiny magnets for? These magnets are small but certainly powerful. The magnets I bought worked fine, but with one small problem. The magnets are so small and so strong that it is very hard to get one back off once it's been stuck to the metal. The magnets that they use are similar in size and strength to the others, but they are embedded in the end of clear plastic knobs that resemble a stylized push-pin tack. You get ten of the magnets in five different colors - the colors make it nice if you like to color code things (like I tend to do). Still, I am happy with these magnets, and several of my co-workers have asked where they could get some. They deliver as advertised with strong magnets, bright colors while making organizing/communication chores a breeze.Ever put a note on the refrigerator only for it to vanish, actually slide down out of field of vision? These powerful little push magnets really do hold several sheets to the side of my refrigerator, without including advertising, etc. These magnets are strong enough to hold several sheets of paper on the refrigerator. I love these powerful little magnets. Was worried that they wouldn't be strong magnets, but ordered them anyway.Have no worries, they are surprisingly strong magnets. These magnets are really strong. If you need magnets, get these. they are the best magnets I have ever used. These little magnets are strong enough to hold notes or index cards, and small enough so that they don't block the information on that note or card--a good thing, in my book. These magnets are not as strong as some of my magnets. There are really cute little magnets, but they aren't the most powerful. These magnets are really strong. These magnets are useful and attractive. The magnets in these tiny &#34;push pins&#34; are very strong, and very effective, too. These magnets are light and yet strong. Strong magnets. These are great light-duty magnets, well suited for the types of things one may hang on a refrigerator. These magnets are small but strong - I used them to hold cards and clippings on my refrigerator, and they work better than a lot of what is sold as &#34;refrigerator magnets&#34;. These magnets are amazingly strong! The magnets are extremely strong, so they're really good at holding things up.I really appreciate how strong they are for being so small, and am using them on a refrigerator. Our other magnets are more powerful (and slightly larger), so they're a bit more resistant to that happening.For the price, these are a good deal for posting stuff on white boards or other surfaces. Do the magnets work?I
