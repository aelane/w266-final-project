Meanwhile I kept the chair turned and partly under the desk to hide most of the damage. Otherwise this chair differs from my old one in many ways. Third, the chair is wider and would fit a much larger person. I expect to keep this chair for about thirty years. If the chair had any deficiencies I could just as easily say so. We bought a chair shortly before getting this one (the price was comparable to what we would have paid for this chair, had we purchased it), so I can't help but compare the two, and the one we purchased comes out slightly ahead of this one. The chair we purchased has the added advantage of the ability to adjust the armrests sideways, bringing them closer to or further away from the body. The chair we purchased is shaped in such a way that it puts more pressure on the thighs, a design problem that doesn't exist with this chair, but the tilt of the seat on the purchased chair is adjustable, something that can't be done with the review chair.Lastly, the one big advantage that the purchased chair has over this one is the seat back is adjustable, while the back on the review chair is fixed. This means that you're stuck with your chair is a pretty upright position. With the purchased chair, you can either set it so that the chair's back is fixed to the position of your liking, or you can unlock it so you can lean back in the chair at will. I just put a chair cushion on it to increase the padding. We both took turns doing our worst to this chair. This chair took the worst both of us could do.Then I spent several hours in front of my computer in it. This chair spells relief and productivity! The Basyx chair is a good looking and decently comfortable office chair in the mid-low price range. Even for me though, the chair felt better than most. I really love this chair. This chair is truly basic, yet comfortable.I put the chair together myself in about a half hour. Although I find this chair very comfortable to sit, it has a few problems.Let me first tell you what I really like about this chair.Comfortable seat:It has really soft cushion that feels very comfortable and cozy to sit on. I can sit on this chair for hours without feeling any discomfort.Easy assembly:The assembly was easy and intuitive. I was able to get this chair assembled in 15 minutes. This chair appears to be of high quality, and it is very easy to assemble. I finally removed them completely, and then I was much happier with the chair. The chair height adjustment was fine, the seat comfort was fine. This chair is plenty comfortable to sit in, and I'm delighted that the seat adjusts even higher than I'd like it to be, which is a rarity. When the chair's all assembled, this is obvious, but when I was just attaching arms to the seat, I felt some uncertainty. The chair arms are stiff. The chair is great for back support but after sitting for long periods of time the chair is uncomfortable.Maybe if I was thinner I am 6'6 and 200 lbs .Maybe it will make a great chair for someone thinner then me. This is not an Aeron chair, but still it does not have a cheap feel to the parts and it seems well-engineered.3. I have sat in the chair for some hours, and found it comfortable and supportive (like a good neighbor, but no State Farm is there). The chair just seems to have a quality feel to it that I have not really found with similarly priced items at a large office supply chain (the favorite of the LA purple and gold basketball team). The chair has adjustable arms, and a tilt feature (nice and always appreciated). Be aware that this chair back is NOT so high that you can lay back and have your head supported.Overall, this is an excellent item for the money. The chair is  of good construction, and no obvious issues exist. The chair has a good, solid feel to it. Unfortunately, while this Basyx chair has better than average built quality, the chair lacks in a few significant ways that make it an imperfect solution.First, the good:1) Built quality is excellent. This is a heavy-duty chair and won't fall apart easily.2) The adjustable arms are comfortable and well designed to accommodate variously sized people.3) The material quality of the seat back and seat are reasonable.4) The mesh back, while not as good as the nicer chairs from Global or HON, offers solid lumbar support and breathes nicely.The not so good:1) If you're a taller occupant (I am 6' 3") the top bar of the seat back meets right at the shoulder blades, creating a pressure point. This is especially noticeable when leaning back in the chair. I discovered this after sitting in the chair over a few days. It is a better chair than the one at my office which cost 40% more.It was easy enough for me to assemble by myself (once I figured out you had to really romp on the casters to pop them in) and seems very strong and well made. If I was the only one using this chair, I'd have just left them off. The mesh chair back has a curved, slightly wrap-around feel to it and can be set to give when you lean back or lock upright for a more solid feel. Made by Hon, this chair is excellent quality, and is designed so that it remains comfortable throughout the day. This chair is great for any office. This chair sits in our home office and gets used all day, every day. I'm very happy with this chair and have used it for a few months and it still looks and feels like new. Everything about this chair is high quality, form the included screws and instructions to the fabric and feel of the rubber armrests. So why do chair manufacturers make chairs that exclude so much of the population?So for me the adjustability means nothing (relative to my desk and monitor) since I'm stuck at the lowest position for my legs to be comfortable.
