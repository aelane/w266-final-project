Love this product, and would definitely purchase again! What a great product! I used this product and it stuck to the stone wall and never came down! Great product! Then you will hopefully be very satisfied with this great product. Thought I would give this product a try. This product was used to hold up an an acrylic paper towel holder and 2 LED light pucks for a 2-week RV trip from CT to the Finger Lakes and back. A great product that is highly recommended. This product is very sturdy and holds heavy items nicely, you won't have to worry about it peeling off or your item falling down. Very handy product. Nice product! This product has a surprising ability to hold a large quilt, fastened in each of the four corners, to one of the walls in my log home. This is an impressive product. WOW, what a great product. A good product. This is a good product and I would recommend it.
