But if you've put batteries in the back of a children's toy, you can do this one.You will need 6 AAA batteries - not included with the labeler - or the optionalHQRP AC Adapter / Power Supply compatible with DYMO LabelManager 160, 210D, 220P, 350, 400, 450, 500, PC II Electronic Labelmaker / Labeling System plus Euro Plug Adapter. You will need 6 AAA batteries, which are not included. This does not come with batteries. Why so many batteries? I usually use Sanyo Eneloops, but when one of the six batteries was a not-fully-charged non-Eneloop battery, the label maker turned on and let me enter the label info, but when it came time to print, it printed very faintly, gave me the low-battery warning, then turned off. It drains (New) batteries right away. When I saw it required 6 AAA batteries (no adapter is included), I was shocked. I don't know how long the batteries I have will last, but if you are going to be using a label maker a lot, you should consider paying a bit more for a rechargeable model. The LabelManager takes 6 AAA batteries so I wish it had included an adaptor. The six AAA batteries add to the weight. Not sure why so many batteries are necessary to power a label maker. Put the batteries in and away you go. It does take 6 AAA batteries, which was a little annoying, but AAA are cheap, so it's not that bad. They couldn't spend about a $1 or so to provide 6 AAA batteries? The AAA batteries will last me several years (I am sure), rather a non issue. 6 AAA batteries. The batteries didn't last as long as I'd hoped, and once they started dying, it was not printing certain letters on my labels. I didn't realize I needed to change the batteries until I finally realized that my labels were missing letters.This label maker, like my Brother P touch, wastes a lot of label space on either end. I did not have the required 6 AAA batteries on hand so I went to the Dymo web site to order the AC Adapter that was supposedly an option. Six AAA batteries! If the batteries are needed, include them, or the optional power cord. I finally decided it just might be that one or more of the batteries didn't have enough of a charge. it takes 6 AAA batteries (can't believe this) and I put 6 brand new AAA batteries in there and it displays battery low. I put another 6 freshly recharged AAA batteries in there and still display low battery.2. If the Dymo eats batteries like the Ptouch does, I'll be well served to invest in an extra set of rechargeables. It requires 6 AAA batteries which are not included. Once the batteries are put it, the label maker has a bit of heft to it. Once I had found 6 batteries, I was ready to go quickly. Six AAA batteries is a lot of juice. I will post a follow-up if the batteries die on me before I finish my labeling projects. It comes with batteries, this does not (?...! Dymo uses 6 AAA batteries instead of the 6 AA in the Brother, but the Dymo is still a little heavier. I tried new batteries. I put 6 brand-new AAA batteries in it. I was first disappointed that it didn't come with any--it is annoying to have to dig through to find batteries when an item like this should come supplied with the first set. I haven't killed the batteries yet, but other reviewers have stated the Dymo 160 starts skipping characters on the printed labels as the batteries die. I haven't used it enough to determine how long the batteries last, but this seems like an excessive amount of batteries for a small device. AAA batteries have the same voltage as AA, have less total power, and still cost about the same. AAA batteries. I put in batteries, popped in the ribbon cassette, typed my first test label and ... well then I downloaded the user guide because I couldn't figure out what button was "print". AAA batteries unlike others, don't look very different on either end especially if you don't see well, so be careful that you put ALL of them in the right direction. It would have been nice if it took more mainstream batteries and less of them or an included power cord would be even better. I find it light & easy enough to hold (even with the batteries) and the keys are easy to press. I was diappointed that it did not come with any batteries. Six batteries? You can place 6 AAA batteries inside the lower compartment, or purchase the DYMO AC Adapter # HQRPAC for under $10.00. To start, you either insert 6 AAA batteries in the lower compartment OR insert the AC Adapter plug that you must purchase separately. First, make sure you're using good AAA batteries. Installed the batteries and starter tape (10 feet instead of 23 feet on the full roll), and then tried to print a label.i
