I use rubber bands all the time, and had a great big bag of rubber bands from years ago. I don't use them that often, and I'm a little concerned that the bands will dry out, crack and break by the time I do. totally love having rubber bands at my fingertips. That was before I had these.The bands themselves have a good amount of stretch and remain springy. The bands seem to be fresh and have a lot of &#8220;stretch&#8221; to them.I prefer this ball arrangement over a collection of loose rubber bands in a bag, since I can leave the ball out on my desk and know that there will be no resulting mess, with bands ending up spread all over the place. You can definitely bounce it so the bands don't fly off. The bands are also of pretty good quality. These rubber bands are great! They are rubber bands wound around in a ball. I refuse to take any bands off the ball. If you want rubber bands to use, get a bag. These rubber bands are packaged well in an attractive little box. The bands are all uniform in size - narrow and stretching out just enough to encompass a small stack of papers - so if you want a variety of sizes and widths, this is not the ball for you. So it's all very nice but I think we'll keep buying rubber bands by the box instead. The bands are 3-1/4" long when pressed flat, and 1/8" wide. The bands are of high quality: medium thickness and don't break apart easily like many other brands do. I don't use rubber bands much, so I expect that this rubber band ball will last me the rest of my adult life. Unfortunately, these rubber bands are kind of brittle and prone to breaking. The bands were a bit cold thanks to the weather and needed some stretching to warm up, but otherwise proved to be of normal quality. My bands are fine and stretch to between 9 and 10 inches without breaking. &#34;Did you collect all those rubber bands?&#34;  &#34;Does it bounce?&#34; are the two most common questions I get when people first see it.The rubber bands themselves are easy to come off -- but they aren't very big. I wouldn't have minded seeing larger bands, but I understand the limitation.Overall, a great way to keep your rubber bands on hand -- and a good conversation piece too! Who knew rubber bands could be cool? The bands are easy to remove, or even put back on so you can keep them together as a ball.I
