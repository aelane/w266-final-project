If it had a color option while retaining the economic use of black it would be perfect. No, I don&#8217;t need color nor am I printing out complicated graphics. If you do want or need to have color, I&#8217;ve printed out the specs of another popular printer below, theEpson Workforce WF-2530 All-in-One Printer. Because I don&#8217;t need the color, the option for monochome was the way to go for me. It's too bad it doesn't print in color though. Alas no, color - but if you are in the market for a business document printer with quality b&w; you are on the right track with this unit. For us, we will still use the Canon color for the times we want color and the Epson for everything else. So I checked out the color scanning - and it took 11 minutes 45 seconds to scan a 600 dpi 8.5 x 11 inch document (the printers quick start guide) from the platen and save it to my computer. I didn't need color, just economy. If you are as tired as I am of paying for color ink cartridges that never seem to last as long as advertised then its time to switch to black and white, or monochrome as it is referred to by Epson.

It DOES scan in color; you just can't print in color.

The digital color image is all I need.At first blush, one would think a monochrome printer would not be as useful as a four-color printer, but when I think about our experiences with four-color printers (always running out of one cartridge or another) and consider the kinds of printing we actually need to do, this Epson WorkForce makes a lot of sense for our home office.

If we need specialty color items like bookmarks and postcards, we always order them through Overnight Prints.
