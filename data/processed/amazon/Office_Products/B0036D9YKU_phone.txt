I haven't had phone calls come in that aren't showing up on caller ID. both the main phone and the secondary keep a nice long charge.The redial, caller ID work perfectly. Setup was very easy, the phone plug into the OOMA and the regular plug into an outlet. I start walking (since this is a cordless phone) and this person's voice is still as loud as if he was following me. We needed an additional phone on our Panasonic four-phone setup and we wanted one that had a jack so a headset could be plugged in for hands-free use. This phone fits our needs well and we're very satisfied customers. Highly recommended phone at a reasonable price. I only have one phone line and it connected to my wireless all in one laser printer and my phone, I don't want the stupid answering system mess up my fax accidentally. This phone does not drop calls that often, clear voice, and the design quite nice. My old phone (which died all the time and was terrible) kept a history of like 30 numbers of people who called. This phone might do the same thing. So far, she loves the phone. I absolutely like this phone set well, and you'll definitely want a phone call given to Panasonic saying thank you for this set.Price: B+Convience: A-Overall: B+ When I bought this phone I needed it for work and home use, I didn't have it 3 months and the recorder quit working,leaving me without a message phone The primary phone base is just inches from the router but with no detectable interference.Update: Two months along I judge this the best cordless phone I've ever owned. I bought this phone to provide my Mother-in-law with easy phone access to replace her corded phone. The second phone is easily registered with the base following the simple instructions and with it you only need to plug in the charger since the phone connection is via the base wirelessly.3. The phone supports voice mail if your carrier provides it. This phone is the best! I ordered him this phone for Father's Day. To get a phone which would work with my current cordless and be part of that phone system was much more expensive. It replaced a very cheap corded phone which did not last and was unhandy to use. I was not sure if this phone would interfere with our other cordless phones in the house and am happy that it did not.

I won't claim to have used every phone that is currently on the market; but we are extremely pleased with these!

With the old phone, I had to enter contacts on each one.After a month, my wife and I both liked these so much, we ordered another extension phone for her studio.

I have a very nice Bang & Olufsen phone that looks like a piece of sculpture, but the Panasonic is even better than that very expensive one.
