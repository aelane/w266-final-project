These seem identical to other color-coded file folder labels, except they come in a small package that is convenient to store and handle. These file folder labels work just fine....probably won't carry them around, but work well for making one or two folder labels at a time. These file folder labels are perfect. I love these file folder labels. The new Avery file folder labels are single 1 color labels (blue, red, green, or yellow), in a 160 count pad. I wanted to get all of the file cleaning and relabling done before school started last fall - which didn't happen, but when I finished there were plenty of labels left.I was able to re-label all the files and folders - which run the gammut from artwork & schoolwork on each child, to bills & receipts for major purchases, to maintaining complete medical files on all of us (& our dog). These little file labels make organizing a breeze. Then along come these Avery's file folder label pad, designed just for that purpose. I recently got a file cabinet for my personal papers. I bought the file that had the tabs attached and they kept on falling down. That's about all you can say about the file folder labels. My file system has more than four color coded section. The file folder labels are another neat product from Avery. I'm SO glad that Avery finally decided to make a little bad of file folder labels. Whenever I need to repurpose a file folder, I have to search for a label, or get a new folder that has nothing written on the tab. These are nice file folder labels for hand writing. They fit all the file folders I have with a bit of space on each side (see picture). These file folder labels are my favorite (I also use the removable type). These really are your standard file folder labels, but they're now available in a "notepad" that makes them easier to store and use.I just finished reorganizing my office, and coincidentally had an opportunity to try these out at the same time. I need a file folder label now and then. A new file folder typically costs around $0.10 per folder. ****These file folder labels are fine and pretty economical. Familiar Avery file folder labels...each individual label is exactly the same as what anyone who has used these over the years is accustomed to. A file folder label would have to be revolutionary to rate a 4 or 5 star rating, though. Maybe it would go find its own file folder to stick on to? They are great for file folders and other projects that may require small labels and come in the following colors, Red, Blue, Green and Yellow. Not so with the file folder label pad. These file folder labels come in multi-colors for color coding.
