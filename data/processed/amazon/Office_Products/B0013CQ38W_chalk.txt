Colored chalk - 12 pieces of chalk, two blue, two green, two red, two yellow, one purple, one brown, one orange, and one white, all in a nice plastic tray. They work like chalk on a blackboard, they are probably too small for sidewalks, and they do snap in half pretty easily. But then you have more chalk! The chalk seems softer and a bit larger than the white chalks I am used to , so writes a broader line, since the chalk is so soft I find I can make a sort of sharp edge to it by using it at an angle.Kids would have fun with this because you can lay it on its side and make a great swath of pretty color, good for skies and green grass. This chalk is smoother than the &#34;usual&#34; school chalk I had been using. This chalk has bright, vibrant colors. This is a good chalk for teachers and art students. These are really great chalk sticks. They are bright, they erase quite well, and the chalk does not scratch the board's surface.But as another reviewer notes, they are non-standard sizes, so they will not fit into chalk holders. I also noted that they feel much lighter than my regular chalk, even though they are bigger. The chalk sticks have certainly made my daily jotted menu plans as well as my chalk board art that much more colorful and enjoyable to create! There are 12 chalk sticks in the set and the colors are green (x2), blue (x2), yellow (x2), red (x2), white, orange, purple, and brown. The chalk comes in packing that can conveniently hold each piece when not in use.The chalk strokes are quite smooth making it very easy to write and draw with. There's low-dust and I found it easy to clean off various chalk board surfaces without any issue. The chalk is non-toxic and I believe would best be suited for art purposes. This is a nice chalk. These are really nice chalk sticks with good colors, not the old pastel ones I used to work with in college, and though they could be used for art, they work nicely on the chalk board. The chalk is very soft though. The chalk sticks are light weight, and are of a nice size.I do not know what &#34;Omega&#34; chalk is, and why it is different from regular chalk board chalk, so I am not qualified to review that aspect of the chalk. I do know that this chalk does erase more completely than other colored chalk I have used. Most of the colored chalk out there is faint in color and not able to hold up. This chalk has lovely colors and did not break easily. These chalk sticks are great for writing clearly and visibly on large chalk boards, but they're very soft and dusty. The chalk rights smoothly and I didn't have any problem with breakage (the trick for me is to hold it with one end against the palm of my hand, with two fingers against the tip). This chalk comes in really nice colors, and it writes just fine on chalkboard surfaces. The chalk is fine, and I kept trying to figure if maybe Vine reviewers got one box, but regular purchasers got six or eight (or 12) for the price. So, yes the chalk is pretty good, and the colors and great, but at $11 for 1/3 ounce I won't be coming back. Wikipedia handily informs me that most modern chalk is made from Gypsum, and perhaps that accounts for the difference between brands. Quartet Alphacolor chalk is of excellent quality. I realize it is hard to get that excited about chalk, but, as far as chalk goes, this one is top notch. I'm crazy about this chalk (although I love colors). I use the chalk with the &#34;Quartet Chalkboard&#34; which I also got from amazon (really reasonably priced...cheap even). The chalk is soft, the bright colors look amazing (like the green, blue, orange...etc.). I will purchase the chalk again. Whether you're looking for beautiful chalk for your chalkboard or chalk for art, these chalk sticks will fit the bill. These chalk sticks are a bit softer which makes them great for chalk art that requires blending techniques. This chalk is nicely colored, with an even texture and shading throughout the stick. We used this chalk to draw on paper as well as on chalkboard. The chalk drew well and had lots of hue saturation. This is chalk. However, it becomes immediately apparent that the chalk is much easier to use when broken - at least - in half.My recommendation is to break each stick of chalk in half prior to using it. You will have no less chalk, and you will avoid the knee-jerk frustration resulting from an unintentional break. I would recommend using a chalk holder when working with this chalk as they stained my fingers and would not wipe off. It seems to clean most chalk, including this, completely off of the board.What they are especially nice for is prepping the boards. When you have to break in a new chalk board, those tiny little pieces of chalk that you usually use take hours upon hours and leave the fingers feeling quite sore.These larger pieces are much nicer for &#34;breaking in&#34; a large chalk wall we recently painted. These are larger than the standard chalk but smaller than the sidewalk chalk. Definitely premium chalk! These chalk sticks come in a really fun array of 12 assorted colors - not your standard pastel fare, either.The downside is they're a bit thick to write with comfortably, and the chalk is rather soft. This chalk is, by far, the very best I have ever tried! I will be buying this chalk! These are very good chalk sticks with beatiful colors. I picked up this chalk for my granddaughter because I knew she would simply love the vivid colors. This is the nicest chalk I have ever used. The chalk isn't too dusty, so it's not as messy as other brands that I have used.I used this on paper, not on a chalkboard. My little artist enjoys these chalk sticks - they are tougher than the average piece of chalk, brighter, and simply easier to work with than the typical box of chalk. I have been looking for some brightly colored chalk sticks that would make her decal stand out. Great chalk... colors are bright and erase with ease. The chalk comes in a re-useable covered plastic tray which should protect against damage if handled gently.I found the colors fairly strong (though the green is a bit light). I experimented with this chalk on toned gray paper with reasonable results. Blending with this chalk was possible but not easy.Overall, I liked this chalk and will continue experimenting with it. Nice, safe chalk set.

I love this chalk and if you are looking for a holder, "Rikagaku Dustless Chalk Holder" works perfectly and it has a clip/cover that is also magnetic.

This chalk writes so smooth, much better than anything else I've tried.

I do keep my Prang chalk as a backup and in holders for the kids to use, but I use this almost exclusively.
