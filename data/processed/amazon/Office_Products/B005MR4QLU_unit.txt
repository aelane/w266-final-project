Pulling this massive unit out of the box made me think wow, this thing should be able to print like a mad man. The unit goes to sleep in a very short time, leaving a black screen. It was not clear initially whether the unit turned off since the instructions do not mention a sleep mode, nor does it indicate how to turn the unit on or off. I really think to justify this unit you need some serious label making needs. The unit is fairly quiet, and I haven't seen much degradation in the rechargeable batteries after using it for about three dozen labels and purposefully leaving it on for an extended period: not being tethered to a cord makes this unit very convenient as you walk around your home or office and use it in other rooms. This unit prints about 4x faster than the similar-sized Brother printer I have in my office, and one of the better features is I can save repetitive-type label formats in the printer's memory for use at a later date and time: I wish I would have had this unit several years ago as I can't tell you how much time I have wasted in the past setting a similar structure up for different types of home vs. office type filing structures.About the only "negative" I have, and it's not much of a negative is this label maker is a little larger than I was expecting - about as large as my 10-key calculator - but the size is necessary in order to have reasonable-sized keys for the full keyboard which I appreciate as it helps prevent fat-fingering the words you are trying to type out for a label. I found myself always hunching over the unit to get a better view, or tilting it toward me. Even more bizarrely, if you turn the unit off while it is still plugged in, it becomes a cool retro flip-flop clock (but there is no reference to this in the owner's manual). The unit comes with an AC power brick and cord that does not actually power the unit, but acts as a charger for the internal, removable battery. But I really think to justify this unit you need some serious label making needs.I also found inserting the battery and label not has intuitive as I hoped. It prints extremely fast.9) The unit prints barcodes, symbols, diacritic marks, automatic numbering, date and time, days, months and quarters without being connected to a computer.10) The unit will store settings for up to 5 different users.11) The unit will save your favorite labels and they can easily be recalled.12) The software (v.8.4.0.1524) is easy to use. One is required to turn the unit over to access this compartment or to check on the size of the tape, etc.2) The electric charger cannot power the unit while charging the battery.
