Also, if you need to make a note on the document you're tabbing with this product, there's enough room to write on the index part of the tab as well as the see-through body of the tab, without having to resort to handwriting so tiny you can't see it to read it later on.The tabs I tried were the 2" X 1.5" unprinted NoteTabs in "Citrus," which featured half lemon yellow tabs and half lime green tabs.

These are some really great note tabs that I have used for a couple of reference books.What I like best about them is they are large enough, but not too large, for you to easily find your page but not have the tab get in your way.They are also easy to get on and off the page, and so far they have not smudged or damaged the books I've used them on (although mostly I keep the tabs marking the pages and don't take them off).Overall they are easy to use and very convenient for quickly finding what you are looking for in reference material.

I've bought the Post-It note version of these things before, and they give you plenty of space to write on.
