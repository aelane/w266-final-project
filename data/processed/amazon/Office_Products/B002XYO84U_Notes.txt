I love Post-It Notes and the fact that these are made from recycled paper just make them better. Post-It Notes are so well known that there isn't much need to discuss them in detail here. Always handy, you can't beat Post-It Notes for their usefulness. I can never have enough Post-It Notes around here, I use them constantly for so many things. Post-It Notes are, as we all know,...great! I love Post-It Notes. They are virtually identical to regular Post-It Notes, except they are environmentally friendly, so you don't have to feel guilty about using them to remind yourself for the hundredth time that you forgot to buy milk, or jot down phone messages and quick memos.The new Notes come in soft pastel colors and so far, the glue appears equally reliable as the adhesive on the regular product. Post-it Notes come in very handy, especially when you are looking for a piece of paper to make a note or to jot down a telephone number. The "Greener Notes" seem to stick just as well as the original. Post-it Greener Notes. I was curious how the new "green" Post-It Notes would perform. Here is what I discovered.Post-It Greener Notes are made from 100% recycled paper (30% post consumer). Post-it Notes are one of those household/office items that we keep stocked up on because we use so many of them. I switched out our normal Post-it Notes for these and they took ink just as well, stuck just as perfectly, and made use of recycled paper vs. prime forest material.Even making such a simple switch with something this small can help our planet.
