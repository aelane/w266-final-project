I LOVE, LOVE the handle. I have never seen a handle on a filer, and this is a really cool. Has a carrying handle on top, is a pretty bright textured pink water-resistant plastic and trimmed with black ribbon--very girly and cute.I think this is just the right size. The handle makes it easy to carry. The handle is great for carrying it around the house. The handle is comfortable and makes the file easy to carry. This Filler also has a light handle, making it easy to carry, something I don't have to struggle with, when Arthritis flares up. The handle is sturdy and totes my growing stack of papers just fine.And- it's a very pretty color. The handle is sturdily attached to the filer but when it lifts up it is meant for smaller hands. It also has a handle on top for carrying. not sure about the handle but other than that, great color and works fine There is a handle which makes this filer easy to carry. It also has a carrying handle on the top and works as a perfect mobile file. The handle holds well.I've also had a number of comments from others on how how nice it looks. I love the adjustable handle on the top and the thick plastic exterior. The handle makes it a lot easier to carry around than a normal folio or binder, and it won't fall open and dump its contents out.
