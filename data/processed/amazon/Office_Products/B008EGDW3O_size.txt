I also wish the size of the scanner were a little bigger for larger things I might want to scan. I like the very compact size especially here in a home environment - not obtrusive at all. But don't let the small size fool you: although small in size, its packs features and specs that can be compared to full-sized, all-in-one printers.My thoughts on this printer:Design: The Epson Expression Home XP-400 Wireless All-in-One printer is small and compact, can be placed unobtrusively in a little corner of your work space or computer table.Flexibility & Functionality: Though lacking a fax function, the all-in-one printing flexibility of a printer, scanner and copier pretty much covers the basic printing needs a regular consumer would ever need from a printer. The compact size packed with great features makes this truly a home-based printer. This size is what I needed for the limited space in my home office. It's a very compact size to have this many functions. Standard size cartridges are sold for about $12 each, although the three colors are available in a multipack for about $25.For a printer that requires four ink cartridges I have to say the quality of photo printing is very disappointing. Furthermore, despite the small size, it's a competent printer.

I really love this size which is almost half the size of my other printers.
