All five handsets arrived with partial charges, and were fully charged in less than six hours.Bluetooth pairing with two mobile phones was problem free. The handsets are comfortable and lightweight, the included (but optional) beltclip being an absolute must-have for my wife. You will get handsets in every room and have all calls go through your cell phone.Overall, I am very satisfied with this phone system. We got 3 handsets which were perfect for the kitchen, my office and the bedroom. When we added 2 more handsets of the same kind, the reception just wasn't good.We lose electric power frequently at our home, and relying only on cordless phones was not a good choice. The handsets use generic Ni-Cad batteries instead of custom designed power cells. The handsets are light weight and well designed. Programming the handsets and phone require specific codes. The handsets come with optional belt clips, and also have a headphone jack on them for wired headsets as well. All the handsets have a speaker phone so I can talk to people hands free and the sound is clear. I was down to only a few handsets that were still working, and my option was to purchase new batteries for the phones, which would have set me back around $5 or more per handset. These handsets use standard rechargeable AAA batteries, which you can find at grocery stores or just about anywhere these days for a competetive price.Setup was simple, with unpacking the box, attaching cords to charging bases, installing batteries, and plugging everything in took approximately 15 - 20 minutes. No static, the handsets all work flawlessly, and the range is more than adequate. With five handsets, a phone isn't far away.
