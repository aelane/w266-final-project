I love this sharpener. That is all that will fit.So, this isn't a bad sharpener, although perhaps it does not meet up to all it promises. It is also much quieter than the Boston sharpener. You can watch the sharpener grind off your pencils ! This Westcott sharpener is BY FAR the best I've owned. This light-duty sharpener does a great job on my kid's desk keeping their homework pencils sharp. I used this sharpener for my kids' pencils for back-to-school for my torture test.I do not recommend this sharpener for the following reasons:1. The sharpener can only sharpen regular size pencils not wide diameter ones. The sharpener is pretty quiet. I have another sharpener from this company that stops automatically. This sharpener doesn't have a multi-hole dial or auto shut off. Not terribly so, but enough so you should probably hold the whole sharpener over the trash can while you're emptying it.The automatic sensor worked fine for me. It doesn't shut off the sharpener, but it gives a different feel and seems to just make the mechanism spin without continuing to sharpen. This sharpener does what it should. Let me say, this is a much better sharpener than my previous 3 electric pencil sharpeners. It serves it's purpose and I see this sharpener having a place in our home for a long time. This electric sharpener does the trick quickly and efficiently!It is stable, with small rubber pads on the bottom that help to hold it in place. This sharpener is easy to use and gets, even my colored pencils, super sharp. The sharpener does not have a stop mechanism other than pulling the pencil out though. Until them we are very happy with this sharpener !Overall, this sharpener isn't bad - it sharpens pencils to a good point, and will hold a fair amount of shavings before needing to be emptied. And, for me, that's enough for this sharpener to lose not just one, but two stars. But because of how well this sharpener handles my favored watercolor pencils (which are notoriously soft-leaded, and therefore hard to sharpen), it regains a star.If you're in the market for a great sharpener that lives up to its claims, go with the Westcott iPoint Curve Axis sharpener - it DOES have an adjustable dial that'll accommodate multiple pencil sizes, it's quieter than the average sharpener that I use in my classroom, and it actually does shut off once the pencil is fully sharpened - and for less than two bucks more than this one right now, it's well worth the cost! You can tell when it is sharp because even though the sharpener continues to move there is no pressure and no grinding of the pencil. So either I got a defective sharpener or there doesn't really seem to be an auto shut off. All in all, I do think it's a solid sharpener. This sharpener is fun to use. My last sharpener would slowly slide backwards across my desk over repeated uses. It's easily the best sharpener I've ever owned. Love this sharpener. This is a powerful and quiet sharpener. I highly recommend this sharpener.
