Seven, tabbed clear plastic pockets. Any more than 7 expandable pockets and it would be cumbersome to carry. The pockets make it easy to file materials on the go, and you can carry it by the handle without worrying about losing your paperwork. On the negative, the pockets themselves are of rather flimsy construction, but thus far they've held up. It contains seven pockets to hold various papers and contains insertable tabs for labeling the pockets. Inside are 7 clear pockets with tabs.This is cute, but cheap-looking at the same time. Has 7 pockets with tabs on the top for labeling. It has 7 pockets that expand and a nice locking plastic latch that keeps all your paperwork safely stored inside. I love the 7 different pockets. Seven pockets with separate tab inserts, I am now able to quickly find what I need and able to remove outdated items without the hassle that other filing systems entail.I see that others have had issues with the clasp, which I cannot address since I am not opening this organizer on an hourly or daily basis, but what I can say is that it holds everything that I need in one convenient place. Clear pockets which I like, with tabs attached. Inside there are seven pockets. All 7 pockets are tabbed and included are white tab inserts to help you organize your files. This has seven pockets and expands to hold a number of letter size sheets.
