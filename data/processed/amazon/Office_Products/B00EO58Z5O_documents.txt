If one of your documents was materially thicker than the other documents, the scanner gave a jam alert. I'm trying to scan all my documents at home, plus my mom's. I am not scanning overly huge documents and my typical scan is around 15 pages. I scanned 2 documents and they both look the exact same. I choose to scan my documents into PDF format, but the software has several other formats from which to choose.Comparison to my NeatDesk desktop scanner and NeatDesk softwareI have been using a NeatDesk desktop scanner on my home PC since 2008. You can save documents as PDFs, JPEGs, BMPs, PNGs, or TIFFs. My documents look great. You scan the documents, you get the PDF&#8217;s, then you decide what to do with them.Overall, I really like this product and would have rated it 5 stars if the software had more features. Basically, if you're scanning documents and it needs to be done in duplex, and you have plenty of time to create filenames, then this will work for you.

Creating Adobe .pdf documents is easy and the scanner will take paper sizes up to 8.5 X 36.What This Scanner is NOT:&#9758;In my opinion (as a photographer), this scanner is not designed nor intended for quality photograph reproduction.

So you can scan all the documents and then rename them if you have to.But using the Epson software from computer desktop to scan the documents slowed it down considerably.

And scanning the documents directly to cloud like Evernote, Google Docs etc.
