This is a great printer. The printer does the rest. This printer also printed really good photos using premium glossy paper.++ You can hardwire this printer through ethernet or connect your laptop with USB cable if you don't want to use the WiFi option.What could have been better:-- Why oh why did Epson slow down the speed of this printer? For 600, the printer stopped if one ran out of any one color as the printer is set up to use all colors even in grayscale. You can't go wrong with this printer for home or small office use. I've had my printer for about a week and it has worked great. The printer is nice looking and doesn't take up a lot of desk space.I was concerned after reading some of the "ONE" star reviews. This has got to be the worst printer I've ever owned. I already own one Epson WorkForce printer, the 600 model. Since you can't run the printer when one cartridge is out, you'll need to make certain you have additional cartridges on hand. The Epson Workforce 610 Color Inkjet All-In-One printer is positioned as a printer suitable for a small business. I suppose it makes the printer more svelte as a result.I'm fairly tech savvy and usually ignore manuals, at least initially. However the Print & Fax System Preferences in the Mac will recognize the printer over the network and then attempt to download and install the correct drivers. The printer is an office workhorse; however, I have continual problems with lines when printing in color. My first WiFi printer was HP's J6480, which became a frustrating lesson in why the "Certified for Windows" label is important! Sadly, the printer drivers crashed my internet connection, caused blue screens, and a "web printing" plug-in made Internet Explorer unstable. Setting up a printer isn't rocket science. I'm not sure I really need a printer on that but of course I'll try, just because I want to see how it works. They tape and pack the printer very securely so it took time to unwrap everything. The printer immediately found my network and the neighbors as well and they are a good distance. Turning off the printer is not a one-button affair. The printer supports WEP encryption, WPA, WPA2 etc.
