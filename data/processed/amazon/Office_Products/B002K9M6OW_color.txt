I would also like a more modern color scheme, or at least an updated version of "neon" that is easier on the eyes, but maybe these blend well with previous shades of color coding labels from other lines....? I'm a color person. I have used color coding labels for a while now, both at home and in the office. color coded the various sections of my files and just made things easier. The color coding allows you to immediately tell what is in a storage container according to your filing system.All in all a wonderful product. The color coding is fantastic and helps to make things more visually appealing. The color made it easy to find a work in process. I love color and these four colors are bright. If you like color, these are foe you! These are great labelsThey stick wellThe color coding helps differentiate and reach out to things without even reading.These are typical post-it great quality labels....stick well..write well...come off well.A little pricey I guess for just labels..but they are cute blue..pink..green and yellow.One can even use it with the printer.I wish we could use these with label makers ..but then label makers would not need cartridges then...I am sure that time too will come. I recently moved, I thought these would be great of color coding the boxes. But what I found is it is even better to for labelling and color coding storage boxes. I put one on a full color photo in a newspaper for a day, and it did pretty good; it picked up just a little ink. I really like the color assortment and that they are removable. What makes them nice is that unlike standard color labels which are designed to stick and stay stuck, these are designed to stick and then peel away with damaging file folders. One color for outside decorations and another color for inside decorations.They have so many uses, my only wish is to make them erasable. They are colorful enough to see the color at a distance, but light enough that print (especially bold black) stands out sharply in contrast. The color coding is excellent if you're breaking your filing down into categories, as I did. The color coding is also a big plus.
