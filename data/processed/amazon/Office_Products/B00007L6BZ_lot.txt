I've moved a lot and have always used Scotch brand packing tape. I send a lot of packages and I have used Scotch brand tape for probably 20 years. There aren't a whole lot of things to say about a tape dispenser. I've used a lot of packing tape over the years, shipping various boxes. If you send a lot of packages, I'd suggest investing in one of those: they cost a little more up front, but they are easier to use, quicker, and more effective, once you get the hang of them. I ship a lot of boxes since I do so much buying and returning on the internet. I do a lot of packing and shipping and the main thing I look for in a good packing tape is ease of use. I sell a lot of stuff on eBay and Amazon.com, so, naturally, I need tape to seal the boxes.The Scotch brand for mailing material is really the best out there, besides the overpriced USPS stuff.
