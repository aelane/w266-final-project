All you have to do is push the tab you are using back down and pull up a tab that is located in a better position on the folder. They have a very easy to use tab system which also means I shouldn't have to worry about losing tabs anymore. The tab system is was great. You don't have to worry about the tab flipping or slipping off the folder like you do with some file folders. Now you can just label the tab and select which spot on the hanging folder you want to raise as your tab. You can change the tab position simply by pulling one up and pushing one down. Each tab easily rises out of its resting spot and can be written on or will accept a stick-on label. If the tab needs to be moved, it can be slid back into its resting spot and the desired tab can be lifted. I love these ready tab folders. You just slide up the tab in the desired position and write on it or apply a label. I do like the pull-up tab design which means I can just grab the hanging folder out of the box, write the title on the tab and I'm good to go -- fast, convenient because I'm no longer fumbling with plastic insert tabs and little slips of paper to slide into the tabs. The 5 tab choices make these file folders even more useful. They are super easy to use and you can re-use them by pushing one tab down and pulling up another when you re-arrange your files. The tab system is a significant improvement on either the little fiddly clear tabs or my method of folded over post it notes.I'd would purchase these over the standard file folders next time I purchase. You can write directly on the tab itself, however if you really *like* to write on labels, or prefer to print them off of your computer, it does come with a sheet. All you do is push the old tab down and pull up a new tab.Additionally, these folders are color-coded, which allows for better organization. These new Pendaflex ready tab folders work similar to the old ones, except now they have moveable tabs, a welcome addition! They are your typical ready tab folders with the same quality and look of most others on the market.
