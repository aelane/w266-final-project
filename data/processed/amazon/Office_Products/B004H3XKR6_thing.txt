However, the really nice thing is that you can photocopy legal size paper. On odd thing is that when loading the paper you push it into the tray from the back towards the front, if you load it the other way it will not work, and it's labeled as such on the trays. Be that as it may, overall this thing is great in every other regard. The only thing that I would caution buyers about is the size. This thing is big so you better have the room for it. But here's an interesting thing... Printing a photo in regular text setting (not text & Image) the quality is better on the Workforce. One thing that annoyed me a little bit was that theprinter's touch screen didn't have an actual keyboard layout when I typedin; I had to use arrow buttons to reach each letters of my network name andpassword, one letter at a time. One thing to note is that the 630 is quite large even for an all in one. As long as this thing is running and I can buy ink, I'm completely hooked on it.The print resolution on both paper and photo stock are impressive and can handle any pro-sumer level job you might want to put together. Another thing I don't like is that the tray for print outs is immediately above the top blank paper tray.

One other thing to note is that the Epson WorkForce line of printers unlike the Epson Artisan line (like the Artisan 835 for example) doesn't have CD/DVD printing and it uses 4 colors of ink rather than 6 (this means less consumables to buy and keep track of in exchange for wider color range, but it really isn't noticeable for most business use).

I'm assuming this is a good thing.

The interesting thing was that on the stylus, I could get the same quality on 'text & image' setting as I got on the Workforce 'photo' setting.
