When using a standard Post-It pad, I am careful to peel the page from the pad from one side to another (NOT from the bottom up, which bends the paper upwards so it won't lay flat). And it was a little tricky figuring out how to replace/refill the post-it pad. If you really thought you needed a sticky pad for something just take a couple from home and stick them to your laptop or put them in your carrying case.These serve no purpose. I only use these occasionally, so one pad will last a long time.And happily, the dispenser is refillable. You won't forget where you last placed your post-it pad. The small pad and relatively flat dispenser pocket attach to your laptop, or a folder, or a binder, or your dashboard easily with the self adhesive strips. The pad itself has adhesive on opposite adges, allowing quick dipensing and presentation of the next Post-It page for quick use. If you stretch out the pad of them it looks like an accordian. Sure you could place a pad of regular Post-It notes next to the above items, but in my experience, I end up taking the pad with me whenever the notes start flow. I thought it would be a miraculous sticky pad dispenser that would fit by my keyboard and still enable the case lid to shut. If you want to stick a post-it pad to a surface, you can easily do so by using the Scotch Removable Restickable Glue Stick. I'd rather just have a pad of these or a dispenser sitting on my desk. Now I can attach a small pad to my netbook lid and write.

They cannot hold an entire normal sized pad, so you'd want to use, say, 1/3 of a normal pad when you replace them.But overall, this is just another ingenious product from post-it.

Personally, I'd rather rip them off a pad, knowing where the sticky band is on each post it.Wrinkles Galore.

I just throw a pad in my briefcase or laptop case.
