The notes are easy to stick and/or remove. The notes have two strip one on the top and another on the bottom so they stay flat elimination the curl or flapping. These "Lay Flat" notes are supposed to fix that with an extra strip of glue close to the bottom end of the paper (leaving about 3/4" on unglued paper so they can still be grabbed).The problem is that the glue is not so good. These sticky notes can barely hold onto a flat desk.I gave them 2 stars instead of one because they are still useful for a temporary single-stick use on my desk (and I will use them up for that purpose). I was out of sticky notes and thought I would give these a try. Then again, I only use sticky notes for temporary notes or flags. Perhaps I expect sticky notes to be more temporary than those this design is aimed at and perhaps I just don't have enough rolled paper to stick them on. Sticky notes can be oh so handy! not with this one.these sticky notes were either too sticky or not sticky enough. I appreciate post-it notes for what they are: dandy litle squares with adhesive on the back to stick anywhere you'd like. If you pull these notes off the way you usually pull sticky notes off (from top to bottom, instead of from side to side), the note curls unacceptably, and really is worthless for what you need it for, because it will fall down in a day or so, and the note curls way more than single sticky strip post-it notes.If you are willing to try peeling it off lengthwise, then they are ok, but I think they need to make the paper thicker, so it doesn't curl as much. I found these sticky notes to be very useful. These notes solve that problem by having another strip of adhesive near the bottom. What else can you say about sticky notes? These are as good as Post-Its or any of the better sticky notes on the market, but these have the added advantage of two adhesive strips on the back: one at the top of the note and one about 2/3 of the way down. However, these notes still curl outward, because the bottom adhesive is more than 5/8 of an inch away from the bottom edge, so that bottom 5/8 inch still curls outward.So, these sticky notes lay flatter than those with the adhesive only at the top, and thus are an improvement, but they do not lay completely flat. This sticky notes have an additional sticky strip about 4/5th down the note so you can have another point of adhesion. These notes do all those things, and it's nice that they're in different colors throughout the pad. These Avery Sticky notes offer an extra strip of glue so these notes will lay flat, but not really if you don't want them to. These sticky notes are still very much subject to humidity and moisture and only stay stuck temporarily, and are very easily removed. After using several sticky notes I've found that the bottom sticky doesn't hold and ends up curling a little. It's still better than the original sticky notes but not sure if it's worth the extra cost. I was very pleased to find these notes with two sticky strips. I use sticky notes a lot, and what I like about these (besides the cool, bright colors), is that there is adhesive on both the top AND bottom of each sheet, making the adhesion a lot more secure, as well as an excellent value if you don't need to use the whole sheet. These sticky notes have an extra band of adhesive on them to eliminate the floppy part at the bottom when you stick them on the page. Post-It notes are always curling up and these don't do that, which is terrific.The only thing I'm not wild about is that the colors in this set are intense enough that they distract from the text. I'm not looking to have my sticky notes last for more than a day or two, tops. These are sticky notes that have sticky surface in two places on the back of the note. I found they don't seem to stick quite as well as the 3M sticky notes. Because of that, I typically use sticky notes for quick identification of which product goes with which order.Anyway, when I saw these double sticky notes I was extremely excited. I thought "No more sticky notes constantantly wanting to come off! If you need to stick and organize notes on a wall or calendar these are the post its you want. Adhesive notes that have the usual one strip of adhesive are perfectly good for tossing a note on the refrigerator or on the computer monitor, but sometimes you might use notes to comment on written or typed material. Often I ended up peeling two notes at a time and have to put one back, or I may carelessly rip the note in the middle when peeling. I absolutely love sticky notes - I used them constantly and they are stuck all over my desk. It seems that these sticky notes were specifically designed to solve the second problem. I am the first one to praise sticky notes. But these sticky notes can still fall off like the others. I didn't think sticky notes could be improved upon, but this product adds a second layer of adhesive. We found that the regular sticky notes got misplaced or flew off in transit between the desk, the folders, and home. The notes stay pretty flat on the paper, and if you've got a stack of papers with post-its in a brief case or file, you don't wind up with a pile of post-its separated from their documents in the bottom. I don't think I'll ever use single adhesive sticky notes again. These notes are very similar to the original 3m product. Basically, the Lay Flat Sticky Notes are just like regular sticky notes except that in addition to the one strip of adhesive at the top these also have a second adhesive strip near the middle of the note. These notes lie flatter for that reason. They are just about as easy to remove as the usual notes since the adhesive is the same. I was slightly disappointed.Yes, these stay flatter than other notes. So, these notes start mostly flat, but end up curling just as much as they would if they didn't have that extra sticky strip. Most sticky notes curl up a bit after they're peeled off the pad. They do still curl up a little on the very bottom, but do lay much flatter than regular sticky notes. They are only sticky at the top, like regular sticky notes. Sticky notes generally tend to become a mess; when a hand or arm brushes one it stands up, crinkles, wrinkles, and eventually gets lost. These are nice bright colored sticky notes that come in orange, green and pink, all hot colors in this particular set. But then again, regular sticky notes probably would too. Now with these I can tear the sticky notes in half horizontally so I have two horizontal strips with a sticky surface the whole length of the strip. These lay-flat notes are second generation perfect. Post it type notes were a wonderful idea to begin with: now this takes care of the occasional problem of the notes curling when you'd like them to remain flat. These sticky notes with a double track of adhesive solve the problem of previous notes by eliminating the tendency of flying away that may be a factor with the originals. However, like with all of these notes, do not stick them on writing on a check--it will lift the ink when left in place for any length of time. These sticky notes by Avery really stand out because of their sharp colors; they are "loud" but yet not so loud that it is difficult to look at them; and that's a real plus. If you want larger sticky notes with stronger adhesive to stay in place on almost any surface, keep looking for other types or brands of sticky notes. All notes are NOT created equal. The notes start to curl within an hour of being placed on almost any surface. Sticky notes must be one of the most useful office supplies ever invented. Even notes that I do not reposition became loose leaf notes in two days. I love sticky notes. I've been able to remove/reuse/reposition the sticky notes multiple times without any issues with losing "grip." These notes are a wonderful idea, and I really had a good time using them. What happened was when I pulled the sticky notes off the pad, they stuck really well-to the pad. I'm still hoping for notes that will stick to a variety of surfaces... The notes will curl up after a short time.The Humidity and temperature in our house are just fine so that isn't a factor. I use 'em for notes everywhere: kitchen, books, desk, newspapers (yup, still read those) and the bathroom mirror. I use sticky notes all the time. The conventional sticky notes will curl and sometimes get folded backward or get moved by something else due to the curl. My notes have gone unread with the one strip of sticky because they would curl & go unnoticed. Though I have never felt that standard sticky notes needed improvement, I can see where someone might want a note that lays flatter while they write, and does not have the paper curl up on the ends in the process. I stuck the Avery sticky notes on two different surfaces--one on another sheet of paper, and the other on top of my desk. I will be staying with my standard sticky notes for now. I've used sticky notes for years and these are a great improvement. These lay flat sticky notes have two strips that stick instead of one. You know sometimes we all get annoyed when our sticky notes decide to bend corners or roll up, but not anymore!! I love that these post-it notes have adhesive on both the top and bottom edges of each note. Regular posty/sticky notes are useful, but the curling would drive me nuts. These sticky notes lay flat, like they are supposed to. Probably, but not as tightly as I like my little notes to be.

These notes look like the classic 3M Post-it notes but with an additional row of sticky on the bottom third so the note should theoretically lay flat.

Most of us use & have used 3x3" sticky notes for years.

These sticky notes have an extra strip of adhesive near the bottom of the note to help them lay flatter.
