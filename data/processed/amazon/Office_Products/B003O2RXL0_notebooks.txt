I destroy notebooks. Having bought many Five Star spiral notebooks in the past, I already knew the quality of this item. These notebooks have been tried and true. I love these notebooks with the hard cover. I've been using the three-subject notebooks for my classes  and personal notes for years, and they really never do fall apart. I am very tough on my notebooks and it doesn't take long for them to tear or rip. However, all 5-subject notebooks are on the pricey side ($7-9) and if this one will last for a year then it is a savings because you won't need to spend more by having to get a replacement, which not only costs more overall but then you defeat the purpose of having a 5-section notebook by either having to transfer your information to the new notebook or carry 2 notebooks around!So yes, I definitely recommend this notebook. This is far stronger and more durable than any of the other 5-subject notebooks I have used. ).For me, I would buy smaller notebooks with a very strong spiral. Five Star notebooks really are a higher quality product compared with the standard notebooks. You can certainly get cheaper notebooks, but they probably won't be as good as the Five Star. Cambridge produces many notebooks and other products for your notes and your life. I use these notebooks for writing my books. Anyway, I recommend these notebooks, although the five subject notebook is heavy.

These notebooks are durable and comfortable to write with.

This could easily replace several "normal" notebooks.

I bought Mead 5-subject notebooks when I was in school.
