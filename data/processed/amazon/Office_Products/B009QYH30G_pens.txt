First I'd like to say that these pens look very nice in the package. Other than that these are some of the best pens that I've ever used. The Pilot G2 pens are one of my more favorite pens. Also, the pens just didn't flow over the paper that well. These pens have a pretty design with white at the top and a lovely color at the bottom. But these pens are just right. These are very nice pens and they are made in Japan. The pens I have been buying from amazon.com are made by Paper Mate, they are called Profile,Paper Mate Profile Retractable Ballpoint Pens, 12 Black Ink Pens (89465)you could get a dozen for less than $8, used to be even cheaper. I love pens and use them a lot. These Pilot pens feel like a good combination. So you think pens are all the same? These are amazing hybrid pens, they take so little pressure to write with, and don't smear at all. I would have loved to have these pens in college for note taking. Normally pens wouldn't get me so worked up, but these are really well made. The pens are not white (okay, partly white - but hardly "pure"). On many pens, this type of pad makes the pen too thick to be comfortable, but this one is just right. Not enough to be annoying, but I have used pens that are lot thinner with the same results.Bottom line, sure, I'd buy these again, despite the thickness, they write nice. These pens mix ballpoint and gel ink, and the result is excellent. The pens are the size of the average gel pen, a bit thicker than a ballpoint. Overall I found these pens easy to write with and well-suited to my needs. I am very picky about the pens I use and I am always looking for good pens that write well and do not smear. I can't stand smudgy pens so I am very pleased with how nicely the ink in these pens stays put on the paper.Price-wise, these are a little expensive ($11.25 as I write this). Even though these pens look a little clunky, they actually write with a very fine point. Just holding this comfortable pens in your hand makes you feel good. I received these pens courtesy of Amazon Vine; I will be purchasing more in the future. I think if you like fine tipped pens these would be perfect for you! I, however, enjoy pens that write a little bit thicker and have more darkness to the ink. These are great pens!
