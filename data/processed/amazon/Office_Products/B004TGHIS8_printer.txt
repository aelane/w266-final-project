This printer was so simple to setup that my wife, who generally hates peripherals with the zeal of a neo-Luddite, set it up by herself before I even got home.The speed is not the exactly blinding on normal print or photos. I like this printer. Fortunately, the printer picked up the new cartridge just fine and is using it as expected in combination with the, also included, HP95 color cartridge.Another thing I did was to download the 'Basic Print Driver' package directly from HP instead of using the included install CD. When using Bluetooth, this printer is truly wireless - which makes it absolutely simple to pull out of a carrying bag and use. Because of this, you need to be careful to fully charge the printer before you load it up to take it with you. I was skeptical at first.... a printer with a LI battery? I could see this as a great printer for college folks or small business who needs to print in the field. The HP Officejet100 Mobile printer is a nice solution for a portable, battery-powered, and wireless printer. In all, this little printer is sleek, portable, and seems to live up to its job as a portable ink-jet for on the go printing. The printer is pretty quiet, and the speed for black and white documents is reasonable. The printer fits nicely in my laptop bag, so taking it on the road with me is easy. *Update 3-18-2012*  I've been using the printer for over three weeks now, and couldn't be happier. The printer outperforms my other mobile printer I replaced (different brand) and is less expensive also. I use this a mobile printer and a mobile scanner ( a separate product). I got this printer to print from Bluetooth devices, and that's all I've used it for. If I move the printer much it falls off. I wouldn't expect it to ever replace my fully functional printer, but it's a great little one to have on the run. I purchased this printer to use while traveling on work trips. Once I took the five-pound plus printer out of the box, it was a very easy task to prep it for installation. I have not tried to travel with this printer yet and if you are going to, I recommend you get a bag for this printer. Whether you need a small printer for your home office, or you need a mobile printer for the road, this HP 100 mobile printer will get the job done. I highly recommend this HP Officejet mobile printer. I do not actually have a printer at my home because I am always on the go. Overall, I think it is an awesome printer!

I then unplugged the printer, and printed using battery power.

But if you are looking for a printer that fits in a small space, can be moved around, and does a good job on the occasional page you need printed, this is a surprisingly good printer.

A little printer is very useful when scrapbooking, but it's just too big of a hassle to lug the full-size printer around with her.This Officejet 100 mobile printer fits the bill perfectly!
