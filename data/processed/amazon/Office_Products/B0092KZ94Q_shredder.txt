This shredder is designed for personal use. It seems to be a solid, top-of-the-line shredder. But if noticed, it is very elegant (at least for a shredder): the top is a glossy black with a silvery-framed feeder. This means the shredder cuts paper into rectangular, parallelogram, or diamond-shaped (or lozenge) shreds, NOT tiny square or circular pieces. A cross-cut shredder is not quite as "secure" but more than adequate for personal use (the pieces in this shredder are about 2 inches long by 1/4 inch wide).I have not tested the "anti-jam" feature. I would definitely not use this shredder if you have a baby sleeping in the next room. I think this shredder works perfect if you have small amounts of paperwork to shred such as envelopes and bills but I wouldn't try shredding anything more than that. I wouldn't recommend this shredder to someone who runs a business from home and needs to shred large amounts of sensitive documents. My first shredder was a relatively inexpensive model that didn't last too long after I fed it several years of bank statements and other old documents, so I was eager to try one that appeared sturdier. It shreds neatly, holds more than my previous shredder, and I don't have concerns that someone would be able to piece my documents back together. My current shredder is a six year old Royal HT700X that is on its last legs and can barely shred a single sheet of paper before jamming.
