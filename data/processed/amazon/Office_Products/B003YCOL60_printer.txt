I haven't owned a printer in years. The printer is incredibly fast, but not of the highest quality. The Epson Stylus NX625 Color InkJet All-in-One is a handy printer to have around the office. My old HP printer took a minute to print 5 pages, and my scanner was on its last legs. OS if you do not have these already, make sure to buy/order them with the printer. The printer also accepts memory cards from which to print.One note for iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad users:  There is an application named iPrint, available at Apple's App Store website. Nice printer, very quick for an inkjet. We haven't purchased a printer in a few years and were pleasantly surprised by the ease of set up. )This printer has a low cost but note the ink cartridges are a bit on the expensive side in my opinion. I have been seeing this printer on sale for very low prices. I never connected a printer cord to the printer, there was just no need. I've never seen a printer packaged this nicely and easy to remove from the box. It appears to be a somewhat fragile printer, but that is probably OK for lighter home use. Fortunately, it got far enough to where I was able to add the printer using the Windows 7 utility and everything works perfectly. "As with the Epson WorkForce printer, the build quality of this feels rather "light weight" in comparison to other printers oriented towards the home office user. The printer itself is solidly constructed. Take out the printer, remove a few tapes that secure the output tray pieces, plug in, install the four included ink cartridges (pretty easy -- unlike Canon ink tanks, you don't need to break some orange lever here), and turn on. The printer itself prints mighty fast, too, even in regular-quality mode. I've also noticed that the printer is quiet, by inkjet standards.At this time I can't comment on the life span of the ink tanks, as I haven't printed enough to judge that. This printer was easy to set up. My printer did not have this. The Epson Stylus NX625 Color InkJet All-in-One printer is an affordable printer offering the best possible feature you could possibly want in an all-in-one. If you have handled a printer before then installing the inks cartridges wouldn't be a problem either. Be forewarned though that when you get this printer, you need to buy the appropriate USB cable as this is not included in the package. Once the printer has been recognized in the network, you can now set your system to do a scan to find the printer and connect to it. Better than what I have expected from my other printer of a competing brand. This printer also the standard capability of handling an array of memory cards of different formats. This printer also has the ability to print 16:9 wide giving you the ability to print in wide format.Scanning pictures from this all-in-one also produced desirable results. When I need a new printer I look for a few things...Speed (check! )This printer does it all, and looks good WHILE doing it!You won't be embarrassed if someone comes over and see's your printer, it's stylish, fits in with your decor, and works like a champ. I needed a printer for a gift for a family member who's new to computers so needed a reliable printer that's easy to use and easy on the budget with regards to ink. This printer fits the bill perfectly!Pro's:Easy to useEasy to setup (Windows 7)Very intuitive controls and buttons2 sided printingWireless printingCon's:Flimsy plastic, especially the paper traySomewhat tedious to reload paperFlatbed scanner - but without document feeder trayDoesn't faxAll in all I'm happy with the printer, but having an opportunity to do it again I would have gone with an Epson Workforce which includes the automatic document loader and faxing capabilities. I love this printer for many reasons. This is a great little printer. It's relatively good looking for a printer though the design is a little clunky. Wow, I love this printer! It's replacing my previous all in one printer, that was about 7 years old, and in desperate need of an upgrade.Very easy to install, My main computer is using Windows 7, and then the other computers on my network are using Vista and XP, and no problems printing. Also, it prints and scans quite quickly, and overall, I am very pleased with this printer. The Epson Stylus NX625 is the largest and most complex printer I have ever owned. I wanted a central printer connected to my home network for some time now and was excited to give this a try. Just make sure you have a USB printer cable to spare, at least for the initial setup. I am hoping it will last as I really do enjoy using a FAST printer for a change. Though the printer doesn't come with any USB cable so if you want to go that route be sure you have an extra USB cable handy.The direct USB setup was super easy and quick with the driver CD. Except it's more like the printer comes with some software that has image enhancement tools. Set up was beyond easy with the printer telling me what to do, I didn't even need the instruction booklet except for installing the cartridges. It also allows you to add the printer to your wifi network either on the printer or on your computer. Again, I couldn't be more pleased and I highly recommend this printer to any and everyone. This printer puts you one-up on that scheme. The printer is inexpensive, but it's not cheaply made! This is the fastest printer I have ever used, period.However, the first bummer I noticed right away was that the printer did not come with a USB-cable for a physical connection to a PC/MAC. It also displays printer information and allows you to adjust the settings for copying and scanning as well as the network settings. They had the black for $7 less for a new one, but when I installed it into the printer, it complained about it, giving me multiple warnings about a "remanufactured" or aftermarket cartridge, and warned that it might not work right or even damage the printer. I have only had this happen once on a previous printer, and it's a bummer.Pros:Very affordableGreat value for the moneySeparate ink cartridges for each colorVery fast printing speedAutomatic duplexingGood scan/copy speedGood print qualityEasy to use and set upWiFi connectivity2.5 inch color displayMemory card readerCons:No USB cableNo USB portNo fax functionPrint quality could be betterPaper tray seems flimsyNo time/date on displayWon't accept refilled cartridgesFor the money, this is a very good printer. I was taken aback by this as the printer claims to support Windows 7. I have always wanted a wifi printer so I was so excited to get this. We couldn't give them a networked printer so this copier was a dream come true. This printer was very easy to get up and running. I plugged in the printer, loaded the ink, added the printer to the network, installed the software which discovered the printer, and I was in business.Print quality is great. This printer prints the two sides for you.The printer is also fast. I highly recommend this printer. This printer is very similar to the more expensive Artisan with some obvious omissions such as disc printing - but if you never intend to print to blank media then why pay for that feature? The printer takes four cartridges - one black and three colors Cyan, Magenta and Yellow.

The NX625 is an inexpensive printer using cyan, magenta, yellow and black ink cartridges.

As with any printer, ink costs far outweigh the initial printer cost.

Since my printer is across the room from my computer and also hooked up to my Mom's computer, the idea of having a wireless setup was very appealing.What I like is that my computer is set up wirelessly but I was able to set up a direct USB connection for my Mom's computer so we both can use the printer without plugging and unplugging cables or worrying about confusing the wireless functionality.
