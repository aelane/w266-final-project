This binder is being used as a college notebook for an adult. This binder is one of those binder you want to get to store papers for a long time (i.e., tax receipts, bank papers). This binder is used in a small business where it takes lots of abuse. This binder has an easy-open button (actually a lot easier to use than other binders I've tried), and D-shaped rings mounted on one side of the binder, not on the spine. This allows the binder to hold more pages and the pages to flip more easily than in O-ring binders.The binder also has two pockets inside the front and back covers.I am using my this binder to hold plastic slip-cover sheets for photographs, and it's doing a fantastic job...really!I haven't found one thing wrong with this binder, and it gets 5 solid stars from me.Again, a very good binder if you have a heavy-duty job that needs to be done. What can you say about a three-ring binder? This binder is extremely durable while stile being quite lightweight. I use this binder along with plastic sheet protectors to keep my printed pictures, and have made a great photo album with it.It withstands heavy use, I have placed more than 200 sheet protectors with pictures in it and so far it's great If you want a binder, buy a binder. This binder is very durable. The binder I use needs to be sturdy and easy to use and these have served the purpose for me. It helps that this particular binder is a bit wider than the standard ones, so my page protectors and divider tabs don't stick out and are protected. I am using this binder to hold all the paperwork associated with the house I just bought (and anyone who's ever bought a house knows that there is A LOT of paperwork). The one-touch binder ring opening works well, you only have to push one tab at the bottom of the binder to open all three paper rings. Not much else to say about this binder, but if you're looking for a durable binder to hold LOTS of paperwork, look no further! This is the second binder I have ordered from Amazon. This is also the second binder that has arrived damaged from Amazon. It is also quite expensive, $11+ for a binder with a 2" spine depth. So I switched to this binder that I had bought elsewhere.

Avery has a nice binder on their hands with this Heavy Duty One Touch EZD.Size- I love the size of this binder! It looks like a binder that should be useful for years, not just a semester. With this Avery binder, you have a black button that will open and close your rings for you. So this 2" binder, retailing at $16.99 should be expected to last for a very long time. I really like this heavy-duty binder with the D-rings. Very happy with this binder and the white gives a nice crisp look to the shelf/desk. Furthermore, the binder has become stuffed to overflowing. The Avery binder in the left of the photograph has the 2 inch EZD rings, the standard binder in the middle has the 2 inch round rings and the Avery binder in the right has the 1 1/2 inch slant rings.The Avery Nonstick Heavy-Duty EZD Reference View 2 Inch White Binder would make a great album dedicated to the memory of a departed loved one. The binder covers are extra wide so that dividers don't stick out. I hate to use the expensive new Avery binder for storing bank statements, receipts, classroom notes, etc., that should be eventually destroyed. I needed a large binder for all of my CNC and computer reference manuals and this fit the bill perfectly!It's large capacity was able to accommodate everything I needed and then some. This Avery binder is a view binder with inside pockets as well. This binder is just what you need if you have a lot of pages to store. If you need a wide binder the D-ring style is ideal. This binder is sturdy, and has a large ring that holds a lot without being bulky.No matter how secure the rings are supposed to be in a notebook, after time, they seem to become misaligned. This binder seems quite sturdy, even with a lot of papers in it. But when you do get a good binder, you realize just how much better it really is...and wonder why you didn't buy them all along.My husband uses this binder for his work materials--stuff he's constantly using and referring to and carrying to/from home--and this binder definitely holds up to the abuse. The cheap binder this replaced didn't last more than a few weeks! This binder has D shaped rings that make using the binder easier because the pages sit evenly in the open binder.

After ordering her this Avery binder she is more organized because she uses it for a complete or "all in one" binder for her 5 subject classes at school. The Avery binder now weighs about ten pounds and she has used it for over five months. This is a great binder; upgraded in both quality and function. I doubt a binder is only opened and closed once. Until I tried this binder. The Avery Nonstick Heavy-Duty EZD ReferenceView 2-inch White Binder is a very good binder. The binder holds 200 sheet proctors with ease. This binder has performed quite well without any issues and/or problems. The Avery D-Ring binder is great for hold all types of documents. This Heavy Duty 3-ring binder by Avery is a great product! Overall, this is a solid binder at a reasonable price. I would recommend it if you are looking for a solidly constructed binder for daily use. This binder has one button to easily open the ring, though you need to push on the rings to close them as usual. This binder is nice and large. The binder is large enough that sheet protectors and dividers don't jut out from the edge.So far, so good. This binder do not have any sharp edges.PVC-free.

Thus, this binder takes up half the space of a traditional binder. I highly recommend this binder based on its quality, functionality, and durability. After using the Avery Nonstick Heavy Duty binder for a couple of months I can say with confidence that, for me, it's an almost perfect binder.It comfortably holds 200 clear sheet protectors, each with one to two sheets of paper (~275 sheets) and it's currently at capacity, but I know if I'd just put the sheets in without the protectors, I could probably fit another 100+.Now, with that many pages in the binder, it's heavy. I was delighted to receive the heavy Duty EZD 2-inch binder for review.Pluses include PVC-free material, chipboard construction made from 100% recyclable content. My binder has four inside pockets which is a nice feature.The binder states no print transfer and non-stick material. The binder is wide enough so any dividers won't stick out, another nice feature.All in all, this is the ideal binder for home and home office use. The binder itself seems well made. This binder has to be the easiest binder to open and close that I've ever tried. I'll be buying these for my binder needs.ps - Despite what some of the other reviewers are saying, this binder has proved to be pretty rugged so far. This is a pretty good binder. I have had the binder for only a few weeks and I can already see the beginnings of a rip at that point. This binder does not, which makes for a more difficult job unless the spine label is rather stiff.Not bad, but I can't honestly say it's the be-all and end-all of binders. I like this binder because pages and tabs do not stick out of the end, and I can place this on a shelf without any of our paperwork getting damaged. This binder was purchased to hold all of the printed material from my online course I was taking at the time. I highly recommend this binder. This binder is perhaps the best quality binder you're going to find. )If you're just looking for a binder to put things in, and then file-away, seldom to ever look at again, much less add and subtract to, there are more value-based solutions. Also, the binder part is attached to the back page of the binder rather than to the spine, which keeps pages laying flat when the binder is open.
