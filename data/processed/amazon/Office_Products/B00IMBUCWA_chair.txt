This is a very nice-looking chair, and it's more comfortable than the lack of padding might lead you to believe. This chair was easy to assemble and didn't take long out of the box. This definitely is the easiest chair I have ever assembled. But if you think about it, a chair with a padded seat and padded back adjusts when a person shifts their weight around too. The chair won't raise up high enough for me. This is true even though the chair has an extra wide base that is larger than the seat. This is a very satisfying chair for my office. I think this is a very good chair that seems built too last. When I got this new chair I was skeptical, but I decided to give it a sit for one week straight, and then switch back to my old chair to see how much, if at all, I missed the new HON.Upon first sit on the HON, I was not impressed. My other chair started at an 8 but after about 3 hours was down to a 2.Take that for what it's worth, but my butt will remain in the new HON chair. Not only is this chair one of the most comfortable office chairs I've had, it is a nice looking one, too! This chair has a lot going for it. I really have to say this is the best rolling chair I've ever owned. A chair's a chair right? With my last chair even from practically brand new I would ache in my hips and lower back after sitting in it for a night of gaming or working on my blog. I just cannot recommend this chair for anything other than home use or for anyone weighing much over 250 pounds. Looking at this chair, i initially thought &#34;that cannot be comfortable.&#34; I am 6' 6' and a smaller chair normally gives me issues anyhow, and the picture utilized on the product page makes it look - hard. This really isn't an inexpensive chair, however, so I'm a little surprised that that pad is simply glued into place. The chair is easy to put together and i assembled it in about 20 minutes.

While it remains to be see how our chair will weather frequent, consistent use (I work from home, and I expect to spend 40+ hours a week in it), our initial impressions are good.The chair arrived in a large box; it barely fit through our front door.

Similarly, it rolls nicely without being too prone to moving.Finally, the chair looks like the picture on the product page.

For an inexpensive chair, I would likely expect that.
