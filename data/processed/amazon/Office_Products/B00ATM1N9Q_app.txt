The app is stable but hardly the cleanest app in the Apple store. After receiving this, I downloaded the app to both my cell phone and iPad.When I tried it with my cell phone, the app did not save the picture. It looks like it will be easy, the app doesn't look like it will be picky because there is a large line up space. While you are in the app, you can send the picture to email or save it to the camera roll.There is a search feature. Have they even tried to use it with the app? The Ampad is less than $6 and the app is free. The Ampad app is nothing special, the paper is thin and bleeds easily, and the paper is one sided. The app saves a picture of the note and you can then title it, save it, share it, etc.It has the advantage over just taking a regular picture of a note yourself because it saves it and organizes them for you within the app.Honestly, I don't know what I would use this for but I'm sure there are uses for it.It works well for what it is but I think it would be better if you could add text or pictures, etc. The app is sub par at taking photos of this, I didn't know if it was good enough or not. I think they need to improve the app so it will work better with their pads and make the sheets of paper thicker so that the bleed through isn't so bad. I put the app on my 4th gen iPod touch.Basically, you write in the notepad and then fire up the app. The app loads the camera with a box in each corner. Additionally, the app is supposed to export the image to my Evernote account. They have an app in the iTunes store that automatically scans the page when it "sees the special symbols" and automatically uploads it to Evernote, Dropbox or your email (you check off your choice at the bottom of each page). Unlike the Ampad app, you don't waste time and effort wondering whether you have found the perfect distance/angle to take a scan. You then can download an app for you iPhone or iPad and take a picture of the sheet and it will convert it so you have it on your device. The app works ok and this might be an ok idea but it still needs some work. Anyhow, when I got it and tested it out, I also got the Evernote app to go with it. I have an app for my phone that allows me to take a picture of anything and turns it into a pdf and it doesn't need any special paper...I've used it to capture notices on the wall, whole chapters of my school textbooks and numerous other things and it works just fine. The Shot Note app doesn't do optical character recognition - it basically tags, labels, and/or exports your photos of documents.I confess, I don't get what problem this product is trying to solve. You can import automatically into Evernote or Dropbox by going to the app's settings and giving it your passwords for the other apps. I use a free app called Scan to PDF. The app has you line up the special boxes in the four corners of each page and take a photo. You use the app along with this special pad to take a photo of notes so you can email them or have them for posterity.The notepad itself is very sturdy. So if using the app on your iPad (which makes it easier with the larger screen to read the notes), the app fills only half the screen. Basically you download an app from Ampad Shot Note to a smart phone, use the note pad, snap a picture using the app and then send the note to someone else or save it on your camera.The pad has a place for the date and has 17 lines. If the app were better and more stable, i'd give this four stars. The app offers a great deal of latitude in positioning the camera - off to the side, at an angle, etc.
