It's just a stapler, Okay?However, it's a good one, as in easy to press and it appears to be just the right size to allow for a good grip while operating it. This is an amazing stapler. Not much to say about a stapler really.I had this to replace another &#34;soft touch&#34; variety, which are certainly easier for children and even the elderly to use, in fact I sent one to my parents, and this works equally well.It's quite big and heavy as staplers go which I assume helps stability during use, it does not have the reassuring &#34;click&#34; when stapling, more like a familiar crunch sound, but easily copes with multiple sheets of paper, and even card stock with minimal effort.Takes standard 6mm staples This stapler uses about an inch of additional leverage to allow for mechanical advantage, to make compressing the handle &#34;50%&#34; easier than a standard stapler. I love this stapler, except that it's a little touchy after inserting a new strip of staples. This stapler is heavier and sits higher than the stapler I used before I got this one.It has a skid-free rubberized base and does take less effort to staple papers together. Good stapler, but not the best that's out there. This stapler will staple a stack of paper with little effort. This is a solidly built stapler that easily staples the 10- to 12-page stacks I do every few days. The stapler has more bulk than normal staplers; I guess this slightly larger design makes the stapling motion more fluid.If you have arthritis or some other factor that makes repetitive stapling a pain (literally), this unit is will make a difference for you. I really like this stapler. The heavier a stapler, the easier it is to do the job. While the stapler is heavy, it isn't hard to use. The stapler is easy to load and it hasn't failed me at this point. This stapler is everything it's advertised to be. Yes it is possible to love a stapler. Best stapler I've ever had. There isn't much you can do to a stapler to make it &#34;nice,&#34; but this is a nice stapler. The LightTouch is a big stapler, compared to the classic styles. The Swingline light tough stapler is solidly built, nice looking and easy to use. I love this stapler! I am very happy with this stapler and would recommend it to anyone suffering from tendonitis or arthritis in the hands. I have never owned a stapler of any sort that wasn't a Swingline (is that the only brand available?) This is the second stapler (both Swinglines) that I have gotten to review. No, I don't have a stapler fetish, but in a month or so, a large part of our sewing pattern business is moving into it's own separate building and so I need additional office supplies. I was more than happy to try another stapler so we could have one in both offices now that they will be separate. If you truly need an easy to use stapler, I recommend the Swingline Optima 70 Desk Stapler, Reduced Effort, 70 Sheets, Silver (S7087875)  available here on Amazon. If you need a smaller stapler like this one (the optima has a larger footprint on a desk) and your hands aren't a problem, go for it. Until now, my ACT stapler was my "go to" stapler, if you could imagine one having such a thing, but with its smaller footprint on my desk, it requiring almost no effort to use, and it, also, being able to staple 20 sheets, I cannot imagine anyone buying anything else, even the old standbySwingline 747 Rio Red Stapler, 20 Sheets, Red (S7074736). The Swingline LightTouch Reduced Effort Stapler is a great stapler where you can staple with ease. It looked as if the stapler was &#34;open&#34;, like the area that houses the staples was not shut properly. Sure enough the new stapler was easier.... but I probably wouldn't have really noticed a difference had I not done it side by side. This stapler does do a great job, even with multiple sheets of paper, and though I'm not sure how it works it is significantly and noticeably easier to use than the other staplers I have. I want my stapler to perform a job, if it does I am happy, if it doesn't it is headed to the trash. This stapler works well. I have another Swingline stapler that uses &#34;special&#34; staples and it seems I can never find them.This one is heavy so you are not always knocking it over and it has good balance. This one will probably replace the ACCO stapler that I love and have used for 20 years, so I am impressed. When I first tried this stapler, I was a little underwhelmed. I was surprised to find that this was the only stapler she successfully stapled with on the first try (the others she pierced the paper, but didn't complete the stapling). Overall it's still a great stapler that shouldn't cause any buyer remorse. This is a substantial stapler, but so smooth and easy to use when stapling sets of 2-5 pages. This stapler is big and the body is plastic, not metal like the staplers I've used in the past. That one is a handheld stapler but you can still put it on the desk.As per the picture above, you can use two fingers. My old, Viet Nam stapler is small, light and ineffective except for being able to staple 3 or 4 sheets with some effort. So what, it is a fine stapler and does a superb job. This is an attractive, dark-gray stapler of streamlined design. Mind you, the stapler was able to use its pretty nifty leverage mechanism to punch through all 30 sheets with no problem, but the staple barely bent through on the far side to hold everything together. This is my new favorite stapler. This stapler easy to useYou don't have to push hard like you do with other staplersIt has not jammed once!, and it is super quiet. This newest stapler has become my go-to stapler as it's so easy to use. Overall, it's a solid stapler. I have this stapler, as well as theSwingline SmartTouch Stapler, Reduced Effort, 25 Sheets, Black/Gray (S7066503), and both staplers in the line do an excellent job of punching through multiple pages at once... Overall and good stapler and for approx $13 a fair deal. This stapler is that good that it rendered all the others nearly worthless.So what's so great about this stapler? The light touch stapler from Swingline is great and a big change from staplers that have to be mollycoddled to get the job done. Definitely easy to use, it makes the regular stapler at our house seem super hard. This staples pages together better than most any other stapler I've ever seen. If, however, you are just needing a stapler to have in case you need to staple something, this stapler is perfect. Good, easy to use, attractive stapler. When I first picked up the stapler to staple a couple pieces of paper together, I thought the stapler was nothing special. It didn't seem any easier to operate than my standard stapler. This is a great stapler. The stapler is pretty big, the image makes it look like a regular SwingLine you've seen in offices going back to Mayberry, but it is a bit bigger than that, jsyk. I have a PaperPro Prodigy stapler that is solid as a rock and staples like it can go through steel yet with a feather touch. If it were more solidly built like the PaperPro, it'd be a 5-star stapler. This stapler does take a lot less effort than most. We received this stapler through the Amazon Vine program and have been very pleased with it. It might seem silly to get excited about a stapler, but I truly believe they designed a great, innovative little product. This stapler works smoothly and staples at least up to 20 pieces of paper. Other than that this stapler is great! This stapler is the first to actually achieve that claim. This stapler requires almost no effort at all. This stapler is AWESOME. Best stapler ever!T
