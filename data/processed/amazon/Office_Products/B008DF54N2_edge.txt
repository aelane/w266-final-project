Basically, it's like the top edge of a sticky note in tape form. It peeled up at the edge. That is a major plus because the free-flapping edge of a traditional post it note can catch on something else, or just get blown about so much that it becomes unstuck and then nothing gets done or remembered. A serrated edge is more preferable. Cutting edge should be sharper.- Expensive for what it is- 3M's previous 700-inch version was a better deal:Post-it Removeable Label Roll, 1 x 700 Inches. I thought there would just be adhesive on one edge of the paper roll. Once you get hold of an edge it lifts off easily & cleanly. It is extremely easy to tear off, resulting in a clean edge. I like the straight edge cutting surface which leaves the strip ready to use for labels etc. The edge isn't serrated or particularly sharp, but if you corral the end of the tape by using the slot, it will do the job. Since the edge isn't perforated (I suppose they didn't want a wavy edge) it's hard to get the cut started.
