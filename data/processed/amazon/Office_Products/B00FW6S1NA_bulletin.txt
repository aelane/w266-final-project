This is not an aesthetically pleasing bulletin board (if there is such a thing)- mostly because the frame is so glaringly cheap. This bulletin board is nice. This bulletin board is easy to hang, is fairly lightweight, and makes a nice place to pin up inspiration, notes, small art projects. This bulletin board is definitely not high quaility with its plastic frame, cardboard backing, and thin cork board. I really liked this bulletin board. A smallish bulletin board, very functional. This bulletin board is a nice size (17 x 13 inches) and the cork material holds push pins well. This bulletin board has a plastic protective frame rather than the usual metal or wood frame; this is the main reason why the bulletin board is so light and probably is a factor in its low price also. Overall, I recommend this bulletin board for the above uses, but, if you have a little more money, there are other more attractive options to consider. I don't need my bulletin board to be romantic or heavy-duty, so I'm happy with this one. I've been wanting a bulletin board for the wall behind my home office desk chair for quite awhile. But a bulletin board that must be affixed to the wall with "permanent self-stick pads" that other reviewers here note would pull the paint off the wall along with it were I to move or remove it?
