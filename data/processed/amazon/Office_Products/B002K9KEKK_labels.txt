These color-coding labels are designed to easily run through a printer and come in four colors. These labels are in color. Most of my labels are white, but it was nice to get some in colors of the rainbow.Appearance aside, there are so many different uses for these labels. Whether you use these labels for addresses, notes, files, etc., they are both practical and pretty. Cheerfully bright, these labels are stick right on and peel right off. these labels work beautifully in organizing my frozen foods! I have had to "tear" the labels off when I changed what was inside or build a stack of one label over another before. I used Microsoft Word and Print Shop 23 to print on the labels. These labels are very useful, and stick well onto a variety of surfaces. I have used them as labels on plastic binders, on file folders, and on cardboard storage cartons. The labels are removable so do not expect the labels to be premanent. I have already removed and re-attached several labels, and they do remove very easily, leaving no residue and then I re-attached them with no problems.I wouldn't waste them on file folders as they are so much larger than normal size removable tabs and are part of them are wasted when you have to fold them over the top, to fit the tab. The 150 labels in this package will last me for quite a while, so they are cost efficient. These labels are absolutely remarkable in that they are large enough to be read at a distance in dim light (more about this later) and can be removed and reused a number of times.Readers of some of my other product reviews know that we do animal rescue and transport work and almost weekly transport animals on an overnight, twelve hour trip, from a high kill state to states that are not over populated and needing adoptable dogs. Most of the labels we have used were either to small or were not removable from the document holders not to mention it was difficult to write on them except with ink pens. The labels are large enough to be viewed in a dimly lit transport vehicle, will accomodate virtually any type of writing instrument from pens to pencils, and can be removed from the document holders without the usual residue found on other labels. These are basically 2x4 labels in very bright neon colors with a removable glue that is somewhat sticker than the typical post-it notes. These labels helped me finally get all of my craft bins labeled and organized.The neon colors definitely stand out, which made it easy for me to stack bins in such a way that I can easily distinguish the tools and supplies for individual crafts without having to search around. These are great labels for use in a variety of situations.But removable ? As promised, these labels are easy to work with and easy to remove without any residual residue. You can print your labels using either laser or inkjet printer -I have laser. This is important for mailing labels!The paper of these labels is just thick enough that you can get your fingernail under them to peel them without crumpling the corner of the label. I've noticed these labels in the past, but the reviews on the Super Sticky Line from Post Its had me a bit cautious - for some folks and some surfaces, the labels just didn't seem to stay stuck.Ours is a a typical HVAC home (mitigating excess humidity), but I have lived where it gets plenty humid inside and I'm unready to say that these labels would work for those environments. Stay away from the labels, kids. The labels are still sticking tight to my cardboard boxes and paper under the same conditions, but guess they just aren't suited for anything more than short-term use on at least some kinds of smooth plastic.With that warning, I'd still recommend this product overall! I really like these labels. The labels stick well to most surfaces and are easily removable. 150 labels on 15 sheets of assorted colors. These are great removable/reusable labels for all your organizing/labeling that you need to do. These labels are so super easy! These post-it labels make labeling items easy with lots of sturdy options! Yeah, excited about labels... So I've been using these labels. Sometimes you find colored labels that are white paper with some color on them. They're bright big labels that work. Then I clicked in where one of my labels would go. Now print your labels!edit 6/18/11: I tried putting some of these on plastic that is very smooth and shiny and they fall off after a few days. They are great multi-purpose labels. I love these post-it labels! Seriously, these will be great for durable yet removable labels throughout the office. 10 labels per sheet.Also good to fold over filing folder tabs to make them taller and more visible. These labels are very good quality. I have stuck the labels on manila folders, smooth cardboard storage boxes and rougher textured banana boxes easily, and they've held up well (after two weeks time) and look great (I prefer neon green color). You can also cut them into smaller labels if needed and they still retain excellent sticking power. When using these labels to group individuals into small groups for games (all members of group #1 wear a green label, all members of group #2 wear a blue label, etc. These labels stand out for three reasons: they are so bright, you can't miss them, even in a basement or attic; they adhere well to most surfaces; and they can be removed without leaving residue. I love these labels. Well what can I really say about these labels? I love these labels, they are easy to use and the colors are great. There's probably many uses.These labels work with printers, but to be honest, I have not used that functionality because I don't have that many things to label at one time. You probably could, but they say you "shouldn't".These are nice labels for both business and personal needs. These labels are no exception. The labels are advertised as "removable". The labels work with inkjet or laser printers. These are great removable labels to put on your files and other places. We could reposition the labels as needed and the color brought an amazing pop to the display.

The labels accept both ink jet ink and laser toner very well, with no feathering or running.

I will have to return to my non-removable labels and let the kids play with this set.

The labels were super sticky, stayed on during transport, and so far at least no issues removing.
