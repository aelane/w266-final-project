I use this paper in a Canon Pixma Pro-10 printer with pigment inks. It would seem CO was made for this paper. This paper is ChromaLife 100+ that claims 200 years in an album, and at least 30 years in a glass frame with normal room light when using Canon inks. This paper works great for more everyday use at a lower price.The packaging is pretty, the envelope is matte black with the lettering in reflective silver - the whole thing is handsome. The paper is in a stiff plastic bag with that awful adhesive strip. This paper is quite fantastic. I love this paper. In general, I have found Canon paper to be the highest quality of any paper on the market for any paper type. printed on costco paper and canon platinum pro paper on canon pro 9000 printer. First off, yes, this paper is very expensive. This paper, when combined with my Canon Pro9500 printer, far exceeds the quality of photos I've ordered from photo labs. I got this paper after I got aCanon IP8720 Photo Printer. With such large paper, it's a legitimate concern whether there's a potential for damage.

I used this paper to print my photographs for a photo show.

The paper has a resin coated or plastic feel to it (another reference to the old days of film photography).

The paper is heavy double weight and has a good substantial feel.Prints are sharp with a slight contrast enhancement due to the glossy finish.
