This is a really nice, high-quality printer, but it does have quite a large footprint! I usually dread a new printer, and this was just not a problem at all.The print quality is really nice, so far at least!The scan-to-pc feature worked smoothly- I had to scan and email something, and it was surprisingly smooth and went fine on the first try!I made a copy, that came out great too.I haven't tried the fax thing- do people still fax?Cons:Pretty large item to fit in a workspace, but the wireless thing really helps with that, as it is fine across the room, and just needs to have a wall outlet.Summary: Great printer with a lot of features, and easy, clear set-up. The Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax is a solid and well built printer that has done everything I have asked of it, and done it well. It is also a hefty printer, weighing easily 50% more than comparable Epsons, which suggests it is also a solidly built piece of equipment.Reviewing ink jet printers has become a little like reviewing microwave ovens. Nothing about the printer called attention to itself in a negative way. I highly recommend this printer. My previous printer was a Epson Workforce 1100; nice printer, never failed, but this one does more and takes less space. I have wanted a printer with photo and fax capability and was able to order this one at a fantastic price as it was one of &#34;today's deals&#34;. I had another printer which was costing me an &#34;arm & leg&#34; for the ink. While a DVD comes with the printer, once you insert the DVD into your MAC there is a lengthly download which take place and then the software mist be installed. I set the printer up using an USB cable which i find suits me just as well. This is a heavy printer weighing in at about 20 pounds. I am well pleased with the printer and it's printing  this time. I also love that this printer uses entirely different cartridges than my earlier Pixma. It is however a very solidly built and generally very reliable printer, and**** Setup ****The setup was relatively straightforward and pain-free. **** Connectivity ****A Wi-Fi printer connection nowadays seems like a must, and most printers that I've come across in recent years seem to have it as a standard option. This printer easily found my home network. The printer is also Bluetooth ready, which means if you had a Bluetooth dongle laying around you could use it to connect the printer this way as well. The printer is heavy with a fairly good size footprint although not as big as say an hp D110a that it replaced, it is however taller than the hp. Overall I would easy recommend this printer to anyone looking for a good all in one or all in one office printer. the printer connected wirelessly through the software. All in all, it seems like a nice printer. This printer is more complex to operate than my beloved late MP530 but after a month, it's working smooth as silk and is both noticeably faster than my 530 and has sharper text output. I'm very pleased with the printer and can heartily recommend it. This printer works well as a copy, fax, scan, print all in one. Basically, I was looking for a printer that would handle various media, but my priority was special crafts. The printer grabbed the single cardstock sheet,  along with the next-in-line, plain piece of paper.... simultaneously. If the printer was $400.00, then I'd expect much more.Aesthetics: Not the sexiest piece of hardware. )All in all this is a well made and well thought out printer that should last for several years or more depending on the amount of prints prepared. The printer performed as expected with each type of paper. Unfortunately this printer surprisingly lacks a single sheet feed option. I like this printer a lot.Pros: The wireless connection works great with all my Apple devices. I like the MX 850 better, although the 922 still seems like a good enough printer. To use a printer for 5 years is remarkable. I am surprised how much faster the printer is in comparison to my old MP470. My last all-in-one printer, a VERY old non-wireless HP (a Photosmart C3180), lasted for 8 yrs before it started to have "issues." Fabulous printer, and scanner, and I absolutely love this and I'm very happy with it. This is a nice printer, and I would recommend it. This was my first AirPrint printer, and it worked flawlessly. It's a pretty large printer, the smaller Epson I had didn't have as much space for loading paper, but didn't give me the same concerns about build quality.My other main issue is how long it takes to start printing the first time it gets used. This printer requires me to scan to my Mac, and then upload to Evernote, adding another step.Overall, for me this is a printer that does the job but not much more. I bought this when my HP printer died just as I was printing our Christmas letter. I needed a printer quickly, so I didn't do as much research as I would normally do for a purchase like this - basically I checked out Amazon's top sellers, then read the reviews. That said, it seems as solid as any printer I've owned. You can scan printer copy up to 35 pages at a time in the feeder without having to stand there and feed them one at a time. I use this printer often to scan and save documents from my computer and it's very simple to use and you can save documents in the PDF format. For an all-in-one printer, this does have a larger footprint than other Canon printers, but it performs smoothly. The printer is excellent. This printer replaces my HP C6180 All-in-one. That was a great printer until the pipes dried up because of non-use. My old Canon Pixma MG6320 Multi-Function printer didn't last but a year, so I bought this one and haven't looked back.It's a real neat printer.I like the way you can feed your papers to be copied &/or Scanned into your PC and you do not have to place each one on the scan bed.Also, if you have several pages you are printing, it starts with the last page and prints forward, so when you pick them up, they are already all in order.This printer will also print on both sides of the paper, thus saving on your paper cost.Also, this printer uses the XL cartridges, which holds more ink and savings on ink cost as well. This printer eats card stock for breakfast. After using an older Canon MX860 All-In-One, which still works fine, I was convinced to buy another to replace an old, dead HP printer. The printer finally died and I was delighted to receive this Canon PIXMA MX922 courtesy of Amazon Vine. I also noticed that this printer is nearly twice as fast as my previous one. This is an excellent printer at a very low price. This is a great printer. It's my first printer that will print both sides at the same time and makes printing both sides much easier to do and keep all pages in order. I like this printer better because it seems to print photos better, has AirPrint, and has duplex printing. This IS NOT INCLUDED with the printer, but is an available option to purchase.The Canon PIXMA MX922 Printer is an attractive printer with a sleek design. The printer can handle different size paper including legal size, photo paper, envelopes, card stock, and can also make custom CD/DVD's!The printer comes with software that allows one to edit photos, capture and print movie stills and also allow printing from your iPod touch, iPhone, and other Android devices by using Air Print and a WiFi connection. I needed a printer with the ability to produce good quality 8.5"x11" prints, and like the previous Pixma class printers I have owned, the MX922 does a very nice job with photos, documents, and webpages. I had a Pixma printer before (MX822? You have to ask yourself why you bought the printer. I've had this printer for a 3 weeks now, using it daily. But I suspect the printer needed the updated driver for the grayscale option to show up.Print quality:  Is very high. And it is noticeably slower than my other printer: Canon Pixma MG5220. Consequently when the printer fed the paper in for printing, it took two sheets, instead of only the photo paper sheet, and printed mainly on the regular printer paper, not the photo paper. It worked fine when I removed the regular printer paper and placed only one sheet of the glossy paper into the cassette/tray.
