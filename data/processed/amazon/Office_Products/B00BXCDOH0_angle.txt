The angle at which it lifts is appropriate while not being too awkward. I've never used one of these before and thought it would be an awkward angle for the laptop to sit at but it really isn't if you open the monitor as wide as it can go. It's not at too grating an angle so that you have to place your wrists awkwardly. The angle that this stand creates for a laptop is WAY steeper than the picture makes it look. placing it at an angle that allows the screen to be at a better viewing height2. It provides a perfect viewing angle as well as giving the keyboard a very comfortable angle for typing. Viewing angle is perfect and typing angle is perfect - a huge improvement from my previous stand.Fellows I-Spire Series Laptop lift is a great stand. The angle and height are just about right; I no longer have to arch my neck uncomfortably forward. I honestly don't know why they're there; the angle cramps my wrists very fast.So for my use, I think the stand is great. The angle is perfect for my laptop, making it easy to see the screen and even easier to type.

The angle on this laptop lift's angle is a bit severe for actual typing.

If the angle does not work for you or your laptop, then it defeats its purpose.The angle may be too steep for a lot of people.

This nearly flat angle may perhaps not be good for watching movies, but for reading emails, web surfing, and doing all kinds of other things that do not involve watching videos, I found it practical.
