The actual paper tray can hold up to 120 letter, 8x10" or A4 sheets.When it comes to connectivity, the Artisan did a good job at joining a Wi-Fi network. Both photo paper and ink are expensive and I prefer a device with a keyboard and a mouse when cropping a picture and a software application that allows me more flexibility and gives me the ability to get a hi-res preview of output when preparing an image for printing.Scans can be output as a JPG or PDF. Using hard paper, the results were close to "professional" photo quality. You have to face all paper downwards for printing, (gloss side down) maybe I'm just not looking but I couldn't see it stated anywhere. I use Epson Premium Photo Paper it's older paper not the brand new high gloss paper that you can currently purchase. I can live with this set up and will learn to check to see if there is adequate paper in the tray rather than always looking at the rear side guide for paper quality.My first print was a letter and the quality and speed was excellent. The front paper door will automatically come down if you have closed the front off to protect from dust. The paper feeder works very well for multi page feeding even with rumpled pages. If you have the paper output tray closed on the Epson, it will automatically open it when you start printing! The HP paper tray flips up for easy paper loading and feels very very solid.6. The paper handling feature is pretty good and the MFP easily handles CD/DVD's.As I stated earlier the printing speed is very fast. The Artisan 837 also has separate 8.5x11" and 4x6" paper trays (you can put paper as large as legal or 5x7 in those two trays), which lends itself to printing photos.A word on photo quality. Need a quick loose leaf paper or graph paper? The paper tray has two levels plus a door that you can close when not in use. The paper tray is wonderful. The paper tray was easy to slide out and insert  the paper and photo paper.On/ Off. We haven't experienced any paper jams or ink smudging. However, you must have all of your paper settings, etc. I can tell you that paper feed is flawless. The paper trays slide out easily and the device is small enough that you can easily make copies from your desk without having to stand up to put the paper on it. I would prefer the custom paper tray be separate from the standard letter tray, so if  I want to customize my tray to print photos I don't have to mess with the standard tray. Loading the paper required several tries to get perfect so the rollers didn't squash one side of the paper. Photo paper goes in tray 1, regular paper in tray 2. Photos also looked good on normal paper (not photo lab quality, but good). I wanted to use just everyday paper, and not any special papers because in reality that is how I print.This is a great little printer for the home. )Paper Tray - If you're tired of pulling the paper tray and adjusting the guides every time you want to print a photograph, the Artisan 837 has a solution - the paper tray simultaneously holds both photo and regular paper in two different sections.
