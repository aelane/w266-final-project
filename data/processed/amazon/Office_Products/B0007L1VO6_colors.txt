I do like rotating colors throughout the year and depending on the piece. Some of the colors look very similar, though.Update!It is October and I have decided to compare these to Sharpie markers when decorating glass and ceramic. Those same colors barely showed up at all on the glass, even against a solid surface, so I can't fairly compare them before and after baking, but from what I could tell, the color did not come off on the towel when I rubbed them.I consider BIC superior if you are buying these to create art on glass or ceramic surfaces, but it may take a long time, depending on what you are using it for, to create an image with such a fine tip... 12 of them are pastel colors like Pink Flamingo, Ocenview Blue and Lime Sorbet. 12 of them are bold and bright colors like Fandango Pink, Hot Aqua and Tranquil Teal. 12 of them are darker bold colors like Rambunctious Red, Tuxedo Black and Forest Green. All of the colors are unique but the Meadow Green and For-Ever Green seem to be almost identical. The colors are true/accurate, the line is fine (but not too fine), and the quality of the markers is every bit of what we have found with Sharpie markers. It has more colors than you can creatively think of, no odor (which is an annoyance for most permanent markers) and the tri-fold plastic carrying case is very useful. She said the colors are just gorgeous, and the pens are so easy to use! The colors do bleed through regular paper, but that was to be expected. I found the colors to be non-traditional, which works well if you are adding these in order to expand your choice of colors. There are too many dark colors that I can't even tell the difference between. The colors don't match the caps! So many colors. I've used "generic" colors in the past when I used markers. The 36 colors give her a wide palette, especially when using colored paper. If you're THAT concerned with matching colors exactly maybe you should be using more expensive/professional ART markers instead of ones that cost fifty cents a piece.I do love that the markers have no smell, even though I have to admit I kinda like to get a brief whiff of marker for nostalgic reasons.I like the idea of the rubber grip, but I don't really see much advantage to it--my use of these markers would be quick jobs--nothing I'd spend HOURS on holding one single (or even a variety) of markers where the larger rubber grip would be easier on my hand.The plastic case is also a neat idea...that I don't see much advantage to. The colors are well represented and labeled, the markers are comfortable in the hand, the trifold case is a perfect home, and I'm extremely satisfied with this set. I thought I was getting 48 different colors but this package is for 6 packages of 8 markers each. Be aware the colors are not as light as the caps indicate, at least not in the pastel range. But the actual colors are actually more vivid, if anything, without going so far as to be "dayglo brights".I'm thinking those "adult" coloring books that often feature stained glass designs or intricate geometric patterns -- I don't think I've seen a marker at even twice the price that would be likely to give such a pleasing effect for this kind of use.I haven't had them long enough to see how they hold out over time, but don't see a lot of difference between these BICs and the Sharpies for things like labeling school supplies. So many colors to choose from: Polynesian Purple, Pink Flamingo, Misty Blue, Hot Aqua, Key Lime, Cloud Nine Grey, and more. 36 colors of permanent fine point felt tip markers. I love that there are so many colors to choose from! Not only do I love these colors, but also my son. The colors are awesome! Again, great colors, great permanent ink, overall a "very good thing" as Martha Stewart would say!A+ recommendation, useful :) The colors in this collection are all very bright, write clearly.The case is also nice to keep all the markers in their own place with easy accessibility to each and every color.The pop into place easily and come out easily when you want them to.I have been using the markers for a few days now and the color is still very bright and do not show signs of dulling. They are cheaper, have more colors but think that they won't last as long as Sharpies. I sometimes require unique colors and this set has unique colors that I foresee using for upcoming projects and crafts.Pros:1) Finger grip: For those that prefer to have a tight hold on a marker, the BIC markers come equipped with a grip. The colors were bright and made their artwork really stand out. The colors are fun, the markers are nice, the package was perfectly designed. However, the different colors fit nicely into my office file classification scheme. Hmmm more colors, less money, US made. The colors are vibrant, the tips are well made and not mushy.

For some colors, it was quite accurate; for others, not at all (and I was tempted to switch some of the lids to better match the colors inside).

There are no colors fully repeated here, just a nice, wide range of permanent colors.

The colors in this set are really beautiful, and have reliably complemented every piece of craft or construction paper that I've applied them to to make my ocean scene.So far, I couldn't be happier with the results that I've gotten from these markers.
