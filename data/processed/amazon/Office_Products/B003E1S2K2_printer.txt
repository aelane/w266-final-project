I use this printer with thick paper and also with normal copy paper. This second printer has not had the same problem.I don't use the color cartridges now so much when I can choose the quick print and use only black ink. This new printer has not done the same problem.Also, I'm happy with this second printer because the cover is sturdier. My first printer's cover broke within the first two months. We bought this Lexmark Pro901 printer to replace my excellent, but fried (power surge),HP Officejet Pro 8500 Wireless All-In-One Printer. The printer came up on the network and the PC software found it right away.Printing from the PC was straight forward and worked exactly like it should. This printer is simply amazing. I have owned this great All-in-One printer for over two years now. This printer has two-side printing capability. It can be easily waken back up when needed, even though the printer is connected wirelessly.I have used other inkjet printers like, HP, Canon, Brothers...etc. I think I am happy with this printer from functions point of view and from on-going ink cartridge cost point of view. I highly recommend this printer for home or small office use. This is now my full-time printer and will be for years. I bought this printer after giving up on a less than one year old HP Photosmart Premium. ***2 Year Update 2012***-This printer has definitely not been perfect. Although we were content with our previous printer, this multiple use machine (printer/copier/fax/scanner), is far better than any in our experience and the touch screen is very enjoyable as well as practical to use. Doesn't tell you how to unbox the printer. Yes, again, unboxing the printer is a simple, simple process, yet it isn't documented in an easy to see format. This is just preparing the printer, not installation on the computer and usage which I will get to in a few lines. Once connected you can tell the printer to scan for wireless networks. I love the Canon printer, despite it offers one feature the Epson does not, automatic duplex printer. I have the printer near me so I can also hear that the printer was not printing. When the printer works properly, it is very fast compared to the others and cheaper to run. Otherwise, the printer isn't bad, and if it pumps out my black and white documents quickly on black cartridges that only cost 5 dollars to buy, I am going to be happy despite the shortcomings which each have workarounds (resetting for the lack of receiving jobs, manually changing settings, etc. The printer has nice styling and appears to be pretty solidly constructed, unlike some other cheaper printers I've had. I use my printer for light-use, for printing, copying and scanning personal papers, ebay invoices, and that kind of stuff.The Lexmark provides a quality print job, though I wouldn't say it's particularly fast. This printer is up to the job if you're looking for something a bit more substantial in an all-in-one printer, but don't need a heavy-duty printer and/or copier. The printer did take a fair amount of time to warm up/calibrate for these jobs, but once it got going with the printing, it took about 5 seconds or so per page.SCAN - scanner worked well - nice clear images, and you can designate where you want to output to (computer, SD card, etc).COPYING - nice copies, if a bit slow for the machine to warm up/calibrate.D
