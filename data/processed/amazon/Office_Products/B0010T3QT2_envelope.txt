However, we attempted to open the envelope by pulling the flap open and steaming the glue w/o the "Red Stuff" displayed. And it usually does.Well, perhaps this envelope will give us more hope.What to say...? I mean, really, it's just an envelope, but look how many reviews are here. What would we do without the #10 envelope. The envelope is a basic security envelope with a twist. This envelope does what it sets out to do. This alone would set this envelope apart in this category. To seal the envelope, you lift the small flap up, and lower the main larger flap over onto the adhesive. If you try to open the envelope, it will tear at multiple points because the adhesive used is quite strong even though its a small strip of adhesive.The inside of the envelope has a tiny criss-cross pattern all throughout both sides of the inside. As a standard envelope, this works well. As a regular envelope it's fine. But I gave the envelope a try and sealed it and then opened it and it did like it said. This would not be a good envelope for laser printers.The inside of the envelope has some security printing so that you cannot see what is in the envelope, which is a nice and effective feature.The main feature of these envelopes is the patented seal. Quality Park Reveal and Seal Business Envelopes are a good envelope for general business use. Quality Park Reveal and Seal Business Envelopes are a very good envelope for general mailing use and rank a notch better than average. It's an envelope! if you need an envelope to send things in, this is the perfect one.The best thing i liked about this is the Reveal-a-Seal. Although this envelope is described as a business envelope, it does have some security print on the inside. When you hold the envelope upto light, you may not be able to read the contents but you can make out the shape of a check, for instance.The Quality Park envelope is reasonably priced and does do a decent job. Their envelope paper is much heavier and the security print is darker as well. I love this self-sealing envelope. It makes it impossible to open the envelope without significantly damaging it. For one, they can easily get another envelope (after all, if you can buy it here on Amazon, I'm sure they can too). This envelope is perfect! The envelope itself is also of good business quality. Well, after licking it to seal the envelope, it was the nastiest envelope after-taste and I often wondered if those envelopes were toxic because it was foul and disgusting. I was able to, fairly easily, open it back up without tearing the envelope flap. Even with holding the envelope to a bright light I could not read what I had put inside the envelope. Not sure how much I can say about an envelope, but these do work great! I wasn't able to open an envelope with out it being obvious that it had been opened, although I didn't see any red lettering, just a torn top flap. To seal the envelope, you fold up the secondary flap to reveal the adhesive and fold down the primary flap to finish. It's also very strong, making it impossible to re-open a sealed envelope without damaging the flap. The envelope also features blue patterns inside so the contents remain secure from prying eyes.This is a quality office product at a good price. Then you seal the envelope by closing. So the envelope does not seal 'flat'. I like that this envelope has a lift-up flap to expose the sticky strip, eliminating a messy peel-off protective strip. The envelope's seal is very strong - I wasn't able to open the sealed envelope without ruining it. You cannot see through the envelope, even when holding it to the light, so there will be no peeks at a check or info that has been sealed inside. Once the envelope has been sealed, its very easy to go back and unpeel it.... you would pretty much be able to get away with it, however there are about 4 vertical slices on the flap - similar to the slices that are in a grocery store price tag stickers - which do end up ripping. I sacrificed an envelope to test this feature. Once the envelope is sealed, it is very difficult to open. The envelope will tear at one of the scores; I personally know because I sealed an empty envelope and couldn't open it without destroying it. I also tried to steam open an envelope and destroyed this one as well. With the reveal-n-seal envelope, there is no strip and just a flap to lift up. It is worth considering over a regular self-adhesive envelope. Well, the first envelope I sealed, it was wrong. The envelope has a unique self-sealing flap ("patented") that really holds the envelope shut when sealed. Hey, it's only an envelope. Great envelope! Other than that, this is a nice envelope to have around. I mean really, it's an envelope. This envelope is designed with a flap which unfolds, exposing an adhesive service which may then be sealed. The envelope is sturdy and goes through my inkjet printer without gettin jammed, an issue I've had with generic store brands. Well, they are a self adhesive envelope with no annoying strip that needs to be disposed like some other envelopes. This particular envelope also has a tamer evident feature. If you should try to open the envelope and then reseal it, the recipient will certainly notice. What's there to really say about an envelope? We sacrificed one envelope to test this out and could clearly tell that the envelope was opened before it would have gotten to a recipient.The glue is supposed to have a 3 year shelf life but we obviously couldn't check on that yet. No envelope can prevent this entirely. This is a very nice #10 envelope. This particular envelope has the safety lining, so you cannot see through it, plus it has a no-lick seal. When I did not do this, the envelope could be easily opened. Just fill your envelope with your papers to be mailed and lift the "Reveal-n-Seal" flap. Then close the envelope as usual.After sealing an envelope, I later tried to open it to test its security. This will definitely be the envelope of the future...and RIGHT NOW! I closed an envelope and tried to re-open after I firmly pressed down a few times, and it was relatively easy to open without tearing. And if it means I never have to taste an envelope to seal it, I definitely would choose this one. I sealed an envelope up and then broke the seal to see the promoted red "opened" mark so I would know it was tampered with, but there was no such marking -- which was the concept that sperated this one from others. Money taken out of an envelope that was meant as a gift to me, which I never received. I would like to see an envelope that is alittle heavier than this, in the same size. You can see through the envelope if you hold it up to the light; so... they're not very secure.However, if you're just mailing ordinary things, these envelopes pass the test of usability. I tried to open a sealed envelope right after closing. I like that the envelope is very simple to use, but worry that the glue may not be as heavy as it is needed to make sure what is being mailed off safely reaches its destination. If the envelope is opened or tampered with? Here is Claim 1 for the envelope."1. An envelope having:a front side and back side;a closing flap connected to the front side;a fold-back flap which can be folded from a stored state into a closed state, which in the stored state is folded against the envelope back side, and which in the closed state is bonded to the closing flap; andan adhesive closure including a contact adhesive coating,wherein in the stored state the contact adhesive coating is applied to a surface area of the envelope having separating characteristics and defining a separating area,wherein the contact adhesive coating, a surface of the contact adhesive area and the separating area are constructed so as to cooperate in such a way that the contact adhesive coating applied to the separating area is firmly bonded with its top onto the surface of the contact adhesive area of the envelope pressed onto the same,wherein the contact adhesive coating becomes separated in the closed state from the separating area, and the previous underside of the contact adhesive coating area now forms the surface of the contact adhesive coating having contact adhesive properties, andwherein on an edge of the envelope adjacent to an outer edge of the fold-back flap the contact adhesive has gripping recesses or a prebreak defining a gripping zone. This envelope's selling point is that you don't have to lick or peel. Take the common envelope. But for most of us who mail an envelope somewhere (honestly I use about 5 envelopes in an entire year anymore with the internet available to do anything I could ever want to do) and let's just say some devious person opens it to steal a check or read some personal information ... do you REALLY think they will look at the bright red warning then reseal it and send it on its merry way so the recipient sees that it was opened? I did not find it cumbersome- although I thought that it might be.I tried to pry open a seal envelope and could not do so without tearing the envelope up.All in all if you don't mind a flimsy box and lightweight design, these are not bad envelopes. I  opened the envelope after sealing it, and the adhesive strip base tore. I held the envelope up to a light and checked. The envelope is on the thin side, but I usually send a stub along with my check so it's harder to see through.All in all, I'll use these envelopes for everyday use, but it seems my Mead brand envelopes are sturdier and more secure for items requiring special attention. This is a great typical sized (#10) envelope. The envelope seals securely and provides a great deal of security. The envelope is thick enough to prevent spying by using light. The envelope's sealing flap has 4 micro slits that prevent anyone from pulling the flap open without tearing it. This envelope is of the 'self-seal' variety. Their envelope is a self-seal, but it's protected by a flap that folds up, revealing the seal. The envelope can now be sealed, and it looks like an ordinary envelope. However, ...ZERO STARSThis envelope is also supposed to contain some "blue tinting" to hide the contents of the envelope when sealed and it ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT DO THAT! The AMPAD envelope has a wide strip of adhesive that is covered up by a paper strip and therefore, you have nothing sticky to deal with--you put your item in the envelope, pull the paper strip off, fold down the envelope flap and you're done. I actually ripped the envelope flap the first time I used one.Security-wise, the imprint inside the envelope seemed fine to me. This was due to the envelope having blue security printing inside the envelope. With this innovative envelope style, there's no wasted paper. The envelope flap of the Home Office envelope tore noticeably and couldn't be opened neatly.I was able to open the sealed Mead envelope without tearing the flap, though there were some obvious tamper wrinkles.If security and deterrence of snooping are paramount concerns, then the extra price for the Home Office envelopes might be worthwhile. The self-adhesive envelope is a great innovation and this one improves on the idea. The Reveal-n-Seal envelope from Quality Park is a No. This is an excellent envelope product.First, it is a standard size, professional envelope, but the best part about it is that it has its own seal strip built right in, so no more licking envelopes or using a bacteria laden damp sponge. Each envelope measures 4 1/8 inches by 9  inches.These are similar to the self-seal envelopes sold in Europe (which I purchase in quantity to bring home) and are superior to other self stick or kinds you have to moisten.A product whose time should have come a lot sooner.
