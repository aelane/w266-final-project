It's definitely handy to be able to grab a precut piece of tape when you need it. But these are just great when you need more than one piece of tape at a time and only have one hand.I got these just after wrapping a Christmas present with a desktop tape dispenser. Personally, I feel it's just as easy to grab a piece of tape from my heavy dispenser than to attach this to my hand. This allows you to grab a 1-1/2&#34; piece of tape very easily. This means that when you want a piece of tape, you know where the tape dispenser is. Each piece of tape pulls the edge of the next piece up and leaves it at the dispenser's opening ready to be used while keeping it clean. They come out easily and as soon as you pull one piece, the next one pops right out, with no trouble at all. As you pull out one piece of tape the next strip pops up into position and ready to use - similar to desktop Post-It Note dispensers.This pack contains two handband dispensers in addition to two "deskgrip" dispensers. When removing a piece of tape, the tape tugs the dispenser away from my wrists and makes dispensing a little difficult.Other than those quibbles, it's a great idea. A piece of tape will release with one hand while the disk never budges.

The piece sizes are fixed so the total holding power is limited.

That dusty piece of tape might not enhance whatever package you are planning on wrapping.

I have been known to cut a piece of tape in half lengthwise...just to save tape.
