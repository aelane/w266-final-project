After all, doesn't everybody want a full color ink jet these days? If you want to keep a color printer for photos and so forth as well as a mono printer for low cost output needs then this looks like a winner.If automobiles had followed the same price trajectory as computers and printers for the past thirty years then a new Lexus or BMW would only cost about five-thousand dollars these days. I already have a color printer/scanner, but was looking for a black and white printer that was inexpensive but would produce a nice quality document. I didn't need color: I already have a Canon for printing color photos. Since there are no color ink cartridges it has just one big black ink cartridge designed to last a long time.The output looks great--the printing is crisp and clear even in very small fonts.There are not a lot of bells and whistles included with this printer--it has no little screen on the printer itself for instance--but it does have an ink monitor,  the ability to print on both sides of a piece of paper (you have to do this manually, but the printer guides you in the process), and it's energy star efficient. I currently own an Epson Artisan 837 that I use for my color printing needs, but was needing something that just printed in black and white since I print so much, and the black ink in my Artisan runs out fairly quickly.Unfortunately, despite our best efforts and hours of time, my husband and I have been unable to even get this printer set up with our computer! This means it doesn't print in color. Please be sure that you realize this is not a color printer. My color printers use individual cartridges, so I am well aware that I use about four times as much black ink as color. No color printing (but then again you only get this if you don't print color)2. I'm not expecting a color touch screen, but a basic two line old style lcd with a few more buttons would help greatly in setup, monitoring, and maintenance.There is no way to setup wireless without a PC, and you can only see status from there as well (or by wasting a page of paper). Maybe I'm just spoiled after buying excellent color printers, all-in-ones, for a cost that makes them almost disposable when the ink runs out.
