There's not much to these paper trimmers. This paper trimmer is really great for the price and for small jobs. I really like that it will also score the paper. I had an older paper cutter and its not working that well anymore.The blade is dulled and I cant find a replacement.This one is compact compared to my other one,but using can be a bit awkward.It works well for thick paper such as photo paper and craft paper but thin sheets tend to tear easily.It has a swing out ruler which makes larger paper easier to measure and cut.It has a cutting blade and a scoring blade,but I only used the cutting blade to cut down a couple photos.It needs improvement in the blade.Its titanium but I think a razor type blade would be better.There are much better cutters available and would probably do a better job. Recommended paper is up to 20#. I have several paper cutters/trimmers and this little guy couldn't come close to them in terms of precision or ability, however it also doesn't come close to what I spent for those other trimmers. This paper trimmer is made of good material, but the design could have been a lot better. My first thought about this paper trimmer is, if it lasts, what a bargain for well under $10. I've used this to cut paper, cardstock, and photos, and scored cardstock with it as well. This Wescott paper trimmer lets you easily cut or score paper. I have two other paper cutters in our house. This is a pretty lightweight paper trimmer. It would be adequate for most light-duty paper trimming needs. If you need a paper trimmer that doesn't weight much, and need to be able to have it fold up for travel or storage, this one might work for you (there is also a smaller 9" version of this available).I already have two other paper cutters, a huge guillotine one that weighs a ton, and a smaller rotary blade one with multiple cutting blades. They really keep the paper trimmer in place when it's being used. I was able to score the paper neatly in order to cut the cardboard for shipping. Occasionally, my paper would slide over when I'm trying to cut.. that's annoying. Other than that, this works fine to cut regular paper, not for those who do scrapbook or constantly cutting cardstock. I sell custom origami so I am frequently cutting paper down to specific sizes. The paper has to be exactly square for the cranes, fish, and other shapes to end up looking right. This is a paper cutter suitable for small projects. Now, because it's a lightweight and light-duty paper slicer, it should be used with care - I don't think it will be hard to break if used like a heavy-duty gadget.It slices paper by use of a sliding blade that works very well, though I have found that it works best for single sheets of standard weight (20-24 lb.) paper. For very lightweight paper such as some photo papers, it helps a lot to have some way to hold the edge outside of the slider because the paper tends to bunch and wrinkle instead of slicing properly. It can be worked around but it requires thinking about it BEFORE trying to cut.This is not a bad paper cutter. This paper trimmer was under $10...enough said. Really gives the paper a firm surface to push against. This paper trimmer works pretty good on regular paper, however it takes more effort to trim thru cardstock. I wanted this paper cutter to separate photos I print on my computer. The photo paper isn't very heavy and the blade slices cleanly. I have used other paper cutters that don't don't have this feature and find it much harder to line up the paper and get the right size cut. This Westcott paper trimmer will in no way replace a standard guillotine paper cutter. This paper trimmer isn't quite what I expected. This means that larger paper bends off the base and it's pretty difficult to keep a straight edge while trimming. It seems to work best with flimsy paper, and it definitely works best with one sheet at a time. Scored paper bends easily along the score, so I guess it would be useful if you make your own greeting cards. I already own a Fiskars paper trimmer (8.5'' long and perfed to snap into a looseleaf binder), but inasmuch as that one wont work on larger pages, and doesn't have a scoring function, I was happy to find this Westcott version. You have to brace the paper against the flat upper or lower edge of the trimmer or it will just crumple.- The scoring blade works beautifully on light cardstock (cereal boxes etc. I did not have any 20 lb paper to test it on but it did fine trimming standard photo ink jet paper down to 8x10. This paper trimmer gets the job done for small, at home projects. Being I work with paper and cardstock on a regular basis, this attractive cutter was a natural choice. It is large enough to handle scrap paper sized but manageable enough for letter size and smaller. I was able to cut the scrap paper easily, as well as score.
