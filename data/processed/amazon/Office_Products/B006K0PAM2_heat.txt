Bulky, unattractive, exuding the heat of a used oven mitt, this Heat and Slide Footrest is an almost total misfire. The  barely-there heat radiating down from under the product was just not enough to keep the tops of my feet warm in the conditions I used it in (concrete floor in garage). It has heat (90 watts) that you can turn on and off. You don't have to worry if you forget to shut the heat off - it automatically shuts off after eight hours of continuous use.When I saw the Heat and Slide Footrest I grabbed it because my cubicle at work is always cold. I like the heat, not too much though so for those of us who work at home sockless and get cold feet, this may not be enough. Even though it does not emit major heat, you should not put it in direct contact with upholstered furnishings as this could still present a hazard.Overall, it is a good choice for someone whose feet always seem to get left out in the cold. I've either acclimated to it since, or it's regulated itself, and is putting out a more even heat, but I find it very comfortable to rest either bare feet on it, or feet with just socks over them.The only improvement that I think Fellowes could make to this would be a knob to allow the user to adjust the heat, but as it is, the warmth coming from it is very comfortable, and when paired with the raised, massaging nubs on the heated plastic center panel, it really makes for an almost spa-like office experience! )Kinda disappointed in the heat output of this, but then, I guess you can only get so much out of 90 watts. Secondly, it generates pretty good heat. If it had different heat settings it would get 5 stars.

The heat seems to come from the middle (around your foot arch) & mine seems to be warmer on my left foot side.

The Fellowes Heated Footrest Provides heat on top and below the footrest.

This means there is no extra heat floating around, which is probably more efficient than a fan, but it also means that you need to take off your shoes to enjoy the warmth.
