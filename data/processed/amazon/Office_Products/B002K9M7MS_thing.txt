The best thing about any new product like this is that it's compatible with Avery, because every Word, Works and WP program already has these templates built-in. The only thing that brings me to weep even more profusely is when I can behold through my swollen lids the now satured and tear soiled labels beneath me. One nice thing about these labels is that you can buy a smaller amount without spending a fortune. First I put them in a thing I call "the printer". About the worst thing that can happen happened... some of the labels came off the sheet while printing and it was a pretty big deal to get the remains of the labels unstuck from the internal mechanism of the printer.Since that incident I have had great reluctance to print labels in my laser printer. The only thing I can't say is the longevity of the adhesive -- but I don't envision any issues there. For me the most important thing is "will they stick?" Trust me, the last thing you want to put into an expensive laser printer is some cheap labels that come off the sheets and ruin an expensive drum unit.To sum it up, I'm happy with them and you can't beat the deal you get for 250 of them. 3M did the smart thing and printed the web address on each of the label pages in case you need to find the template. The only thing you need to do, if you use an Inkjet printer is to cover the label with clear tape. A big thing for me with labels is how easy is it to get to the template.
