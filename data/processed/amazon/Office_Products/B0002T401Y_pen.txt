Obviously this pen is not a very expensive fountain pen that is a 'showpiece', rather it is an everyday pen that should survive daily use and is a replacement for a ballpoint or rollerball pen. Lamy recommends filling the pen with the converter inside the pen and filling through the nib. This is a great pen. This pen would make a great gift for someone who's a office junkie. I bought this to use as an everyday pen at school (I'm a teacher). I don't think you can go wrong with either for an inexpensive pen. I am really pleased with the pen. I ordered this pen and the first one had a super scratchy nib - it can happen and it is a Fine nib, but it sounded like I was ripping phone-books while writing. The second pen I got, the nib would have worked if I could tilt the pen more, but then my finger was holding the edge and not on the 'guides'. For a $20 pen, this wasn't worth the hassle. It's a fucntional pen that needed to work right the first time and every time - it didn't.I did give it a second star for the fact it started writing instantly, every try. I can casually toss the capped pen into my backpack knowing that it will be safe.Now that I've entered the world of fountain pens, I expect I will be on the lookout for another pen to try. I'm using this pen to address our wedding invitations; it's beautiful and so is its calligraphy. Very Stylish looking pen, plastic barrel, so it's a little lighter than other pens, but feels surprisingly well weighted when posted. Not a leaky pen, and can be swung around quite vigorously with confidence.
