This Sharpie highlighter is everything I ever wanted in a highlighter. This new highlighter is gel so it glides smoothly over paper. It took a little getting used to how easy the highlighter moved. You'll find that you'll use this highlighter somewhat differently than the traditional type; it's just that the medium is that different. This highlighter works much like a crayon and leaves a wax-like, gel residue. This highlighter just felt weird to me. When it wears down, you twist the top and more comes out.-They don't have that &#34;highlighter smell.&#34;The cons:-These do not work for fine detailing. I really needed a highlighter like this because other ones were leaking to the other pages in my journal. It goes on a little stickier than a normal highlighter. It's not often that one finds a truly innovative highlighter, but this product really does seem to be something new and different in the highlighter world. Using this highlighter I can not see the color from the back of the page unless I hold the paper to the light. This highlighter feels weird and when you hit the tip on something it tears or gets a cut because the tip is gel. I was able to smear the highlighter a tiny bit with my lotiony finger. Not sure any highlighter could avoid that. The highlighter does go on nicely and neatly, with no mess, fuss or bother. As the highlighter gel is used up, the bottom of the "pen" can be turned to expose more of it. It's not necessarily offensive, but it's much stronger than a typical highlighter. One might remember that a basic highlighter is almost a felt type of substance, which the "color" lives until it is pressed against the paper in order to "highlight". All were very bright.However, this highlighter does stand for some improvement. The highlighter stick twists up from the base, again like a deodorant stick, so you pretty much know how much you have left to work with.

That gel gets used up it seems faster than a regular highlighter.

I ordered the Sharpie Accent Gel highlighter more than 8 months ago, intentionally waiting to write this review until enough time had passed that I could comment on the lifespan of this highlighter.

The highlighter consists of only 1/4" of the gel material; any individual with a heavy hand will quickly wear it down to the end.I recommend the Sharpie Accent Gel Highlighters for use on light-weight or slick papers, but cannot recommend them for regular, frequent use.
