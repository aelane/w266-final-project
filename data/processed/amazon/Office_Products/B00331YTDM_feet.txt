I also like to rock my feet a bit when at the desk typing or thinking of what I want to write. Something about rocking my feet while I am working just doesn't go together. It's not natural to sit with one's feet tightly together for a prolonged period. Raises your feet off the ground which makes you sit straighter in your seat making your back feel better. I had a stationary one, and my feet felt more relax on the this one.Put it together is not a job for weak hand. I didn't realize how often I moved my feet, but now I can do so without scuffing up my shoes (I save on shoe polish now!). Having my feet at the best heighth and angle means that I can sit properly and not strain my back and arms.This item is fast and easy to assemble without tools and not expensive like some footrests are.I am very pleased with this item and would recommend it to anyone having pain or stiffness after long periods at a desk or computer. And even when I do NOT rock my feet on it, it still slides across the chair mat that I use to protect my hardwood floors. I stretch my feet too, by rocking all the way forward, holding it & rocking all the way back & holding it. I can rock my feet back and forth too. When I get bored with this, I move my feet back to the main unit & use the footrest as it was intended to be used. I think he wants to prop his feet up on the desk.All in all, it would be great for someone in an office atmosphere, that is sitting in front of a computer for hours and less for someone who is able to get up or moves around frequently. I can rock my feet on it and it resolves that need to fidget and I can continue typing or doing whatever it is that I need to do at the desk. I wasn't able to get the feet to slide down to lock into place. I used to catch myself tapping my feet a lot and would have to make myself stop so I don't drive my co-workers nuts. Still, I tend to put my feet on the rockers themselves just for that little extra height. If you put your feet in the middle, yes there is some creaking.
