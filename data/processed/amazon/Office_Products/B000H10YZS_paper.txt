But with this paper I am very pleased with the results! This paper was heads and shoulders better than most I use for 4x6 prints. I used this paper with aEpson Artisan 1430 Wireless Wide-Format Color Inkjet Printerset to maximum quality and I was amazed at how great the results were. Great photo paper at a great price. This would be a 5-star paper, but I have also used Canon's new luster paper and find it to be superior. The luster paper isn't as bumpy as this paper and has even less gloss. The luster paper is even better at avoiding glare.If Canon offered their luster paper in 5x7, I'd buy that instead of this. But still, I'm quite happy with this paper and will buy it for any framed photos. This is a great paper to get for printing photos. This is excellent paper for the price, but I can't justify giving it 5 stars as long as the Pro Platinum paper exists. Not much to say other than I have used this paper for several years and continue to buy it. Also worth noting that this paper is shipped by CalumetPhoto and the price is less than the same paper shipped by Amazon. This paper is the best I have ever used. It's hard to find paper in that aspect so I print them on the 13x19 and then just trim off the excess. But this Canon paper (semi-gloss) and in the Photo Paper Plus II in glossy have yielded the best prints I have ever seen. I think it will be my new paper of choice so I just ordered the 13x19 size as well. Great paper that produces beautiful pictures.

I love this paper... it is the perfect match for my Pixma printer.

I very much prefer the semi-gloss paper to the matte version, and I prefer the 8x10 size to the plain letter size.

That's how good this paper can make your prints look (with the right printer).It's a touch expensive and I'd like to buy in bigger bulk than just 20 sheets (I blew through 20 sheets in 3 weeks during class), but for those who print photos irregularly, this isn't a problem.
