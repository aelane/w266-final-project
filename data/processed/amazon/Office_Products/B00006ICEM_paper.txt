The paper is lightweight so if you're looking for something sturdy that will last through rough usage, this is not your divider set.I like these tabs for my light binder that I don't use often, it stores some info I need to have on hand, but it's not a high use binder. They used a reasonably solid paper material with a little bit of reinforcement around the area where the holes are for the binder. The paper is strong and not fragile at all. These are made out of paper and can tear if you are not careful.For dividing on a SHORT TERM USE or very light use, these are OK.If you need to buy something more durable that will last for a long time, I cannot recommend these. The paper is not as study as others I've used, but there is a reinforcing strip to -hopefully- keep the holes from breaking out. if the paper was sturdier I'd give them five stars, as is... The paper is heavier and the edges of the tabs and the three holes are reinforced so to make them rip-proof. They reach past the lined paper so I can easily see the sections.They are handy and a heck of a deal. The yellow paper that comprises the divider itself is a step up from looseleaf paper but certainly not a heavy cardstock and my package arrived with a lot of dents already in these dividers - just from regular package handling. They are paper dividers with tabs and they work well for what they are. The paper is not terribly sturdy, but enough for all but the most high-use applications.Personally, I think I'll stick to the write-on tabs from now on. They're made from a slightly-thicker-than-usual paper. The paper is good quality.The tabs on the edges of the dividers are about an inch and a half long and half an inch high. Detachable paper rectangles are suitable for writing and they insert into the colored plastic tabs perfectly.
