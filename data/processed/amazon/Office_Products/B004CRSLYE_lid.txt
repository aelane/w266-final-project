You don't always have to open the lid to shred items either. On the lid that you close down on the paper the center section is raised in order to push down on the paper on the center. Open the lid, drop the stack horizontally, close the lid, and let the shredder work its magic. As advertised, you can lift the lid and lay a stack of papers on the interior platform, close the lid, and then enjoy the (surprisingly quiet) sound of grinding.So far, it's performed very well (I've filled the not-huge capacity storage cubby about 4 times) but there has been the occasional jam if the stack of papers isn't "just so." My previous one had a very heavy lid as it was very good quality but it made a mess when you take off the lid to empty. You lift the lid and lay the pile of paper down flat within the unit. Then you close the lid. Just lift the lid, slide 20 or so sheets in and voila it quietly munches on the sheets one at a time. Open the lid by pulling on the release that looks like it should be pushed like a button, stack your papers in the tray and push the lid closed to start the cycle.Just like a dishwasher, you have to understand a little about how the machine works to get the best results. When you open the lid, than cuts power to the cutters and rollers, so you can't use reverse mode to help you pull jammed paper free. You have to lift the lid and press reverse and hope whatever's stuck in there will come out. Open the lid, and you can lay flat sheets of paper in the shredding area - up to 60 according to Swingline. Close the lid and the shredder grabs the paper, one sheet at a time with two rubberized rollers, and feeds it into the shredder.
