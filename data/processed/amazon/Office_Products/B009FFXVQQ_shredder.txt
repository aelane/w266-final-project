First off, this is a fairly large shredder. Thankfully, once the shredder was free from the enormous boxes, it didn't seem *too* oversized.The first thing I noticed when shredding was how quiet this machine is (which is a far cry from most of the smaller shredders I've used), and I was really pleased by that. This is an expensive shredder, but I think it is worth the purchase price. It was priced close to this Fellowes shredder. This is a serious shredder that deserves its own space. This shredder is very expensive but as the old adage goes "you get what you pay for!" I got the shredder in and took it out of the box (if you lift on the plastic around the shredder and hold the box with your feet you can pull it out). I took the shredder out and in the drawer you will find instructions, wheels, bags and a small container of oil. I put the shredder on its size and popped the wheels on and than put it back upright. I put the shredder in a room (since the shredder opens on the side, I can put it between items long way and not have to take up a lot of horizontal wall space). This shredder is super quiet and goes to sleep to save power (you would not know since using it never seems to take any time), and the smart touch sensor stops if your hands touch the metal around the opening (a nice safety feature). The shredder is super quiet and the bin is large and easy to come out. The shredder includes a  small bottle of oil, but since I had a larger bottle of Fellowes shredder oil, I just poured it into that. This is a really nice shredder and the super small shred, large bin and super quiet operation makes this great! This is a real nice shredder. Firstly, it's quick for a small shredder. More often than not, we have to do some, let the shredder cool down and start again. With this shredder, we haven't had it over heat yet, so in one sitting, we get it all done. Lastly, the shredder seems to be a solid, well built machine. The Fellowes Powershred 99Ms is a powerful shredder that destroys thick piles of important documents in near silence. You almost have to see it to believe how quiet this shredder is. When I unboxed my shredder, the logo placard had broken off and was loose in the box. Before I got this shredder, I hadAmazonBasics 8-Sheet Micro-Cut Paper/CD/Credit Card Shredder with Pullout Basket. This Goliath of a shredder is extremely easy to set-up and use. It holds far more than my old shredder and has a clear window so you can glance to see how much space is left.The bits of shredded paper are quite small. I haven't had the shredder long enough to try oiling it, but it seems like it will be an easy process.Overall, this is a great shredder. I wonder if Oliver North had a shredder this capable? The shredder immediately stopped. This shredder has a 9 gallon bin, so frequent emptying will probably not be necessary for most users. To keep any shredder running at optimal efficiency, it is crucial to oil it on a regular basis. every shredder i've had sent my cats running in every direction just to get away... except this one. Although this is a heavy shredder (almost 2 feet in height), the casters (4 casters come with it) make it easy to move it around, and the pull-out basket comes out in the front.

This is not the shredder to get if you have an occasional document to dispose of.

This is the first shredder this expensive I have owned (about $385 on Amazon as I write this), so I honestly can't compare it to others in this price range.

I own another Fellowes shredder purchased almost seven years ago which is still working very well, so I have been very satisfied with its performance.
