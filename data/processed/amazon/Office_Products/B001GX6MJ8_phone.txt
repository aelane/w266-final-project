When I saw this phone I figured I could not lose. I would have the phone and the headset.I love the size of this phone. It is small so the phone unit can either hook onto clothing or be slipped into a loose pocket for walking around and talking. Well, I'm pleased to review this phone, especially since I already own another Plantronics headset phone, but that one hurts my ears. You can choose to have the phone automatically answer when you pick up the handset, or you can use the option to have it answer only after you press "talk," you can choose pulse or tone dialing, and expand your network to up to four handsets per base. I was a little skeptical about this little 'headset phone' since it seems to me that it's basically just a phone without a speaker or mic. This phone lives up to my expectations here.2) Nice headset. I use this phone on conference calls for work, so the mute button is the most important button on the phone:). I have to say that this phone seems a bit on the expensive side - especially for a phone with no built-in speaker or mic.Overall, I would recommend this product. If you need to stop wedging a phone between your head and shoulder to work on the computer while on the phone, this is a fine product. It could be that it only works with standard phone lines. I had my first Plantronics phone of this type 8 years ago. I find the phone comfortable to wear and easy to use. I was able to take this phone at least 300 feet OUTSIDE of my home -- and that's with the base being placed on the floor far from any exterior walls. Good Stuff+ The phone itself has all the typical features I need+ The battery is NiMh so less memory effects and less environmentally unsafe than NiCad+ The unit is small and very light+ The headset sits on top of the antenna when not in use and I think that's pretty coolBad Stuff- The audio quality is just ok. This phone is easy to program, too. And unlike my panasonic - never did this phone fail to obtain a base connection within a reasonable range+ None/low interference with wireless networkThe bad=========If there is one big item that needs to improve in this phone - it is the user interface.

Excellent.5) The phone blinks to advise you that you have messages - this works well with a VoIP system.

I can't believe this phone gets poor reviews.

It was like having a corded phone.
