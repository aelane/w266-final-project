I really like the binder portion being on the back of the product, so you are able to get more papers in it and the paper doesn't bow up as much when it is not full. The binder I received appeared to have been exposed to a very dusty and dirty environment and was quite filthy. This large, medium/heavy-duty binder is great for frequently accessed documents. This is a large D-ring binder. I'd give the binder five stars, except that the case is not very sturdy. A great binder that rolls with the punches. I first thought that this is just a binder, what on earth can I say about a binder? Well it turns out that this binder has additional features that put it above your average binder.First, this binder has a gap free guarantee. They call it the EZ-Turn Ring.Second, this binder had the rings attached to the bottom flap instead of in the middle. That makes this an environmentally friendly binder as well!There are 2 reasons I give this 4 instead of 5 stars. The Heavy Duty binder has the easy open with one touch feature, but this one doesn't. However, its not like a binder has a ton of fancy features to write a review about. If you need a binder, this will work fine. This binder has the "D" shaped rings for ease of page turning and the 4 stacked pockets which is always needed with binders. Excellent binder which has 2 side pockets to put things in. This binder is lightweight yet durable. I especially like that the binder is wider so that dividers do not hang over the side. I like this binder. This binder  solves my back issues! This binder is large, durable and best of all SUPER CHEAP compared to similar items at office supply stores. I highly recommend this binder. And I have thoroughly tested this binder! It has been the most durable binder that I have ever used.For me, the purpose for this binder is to keep copies of printed out bill reciepts and other household information.This binder is very easy to open and to close. Also, frequently a binder is used for something other than what is was originally purchased for. Because of the binder's extra width, dividers and index tabs are protected from damage. In my particular binder, the plastic view panel on the front was a little puckered looking. I also made a "Manual" binder which holds all the instruction booklet for the various appliances around the house. I like the binder enough that I can live with the fact that it sticks our farther than my other binders. The binder would be better with one flap of thicker material, front and back. Second, if your binder will be subject to abuse, you should go with the heavy duty version. Since I use this binder for material that I need to access on the top of a desk, the lying flat feature of the rings is handy not a bother. A binder is a binder ... well, this one is actually nice and durable, as the name suggests. This binder has an interesting oblong shape to the rings. If the binder is full of paper and you drop the binder, it is very likely the rings will pop open and spill the pages. Avery's Heavy Duty binder has a positive lock that would prevent the rings from popping open.The chipboard that adds rigidity to the covers is made of 100% recycled paper.Ths is a minor feature, but for me any effort to recycle is a plus.The hinges on this binder don't appear to be any more durable than other binders. This binder has been great for me so far, not problems with opening it and it seems very durable. The binder will handle reasonable use but heavy use (such as slinging around in a book bag) will probably tear it up within about a year (guess). This binder's rings are situated on the rightmost page, with male pegs to female inlets as opposed to the squiggly s-connector used in many binders that papers sometimes work their way into, or worse yet, out of. This is a very versatile binder which can easily hold numerous paper documents. I've been using the binder for a few weeks now. This is a nice large-sized binder. Inside the binder has three pockets on each side. I don't feel like the binder itself is overly strong, but for most uses I think it will hold up just fine. The inside binder area has room to put a couple pens or pencils.This is truly a 21st century update of an old favorite at a GREAT price! This is a sturdy binder with plenty of space for documents. If you need a good binder to keep documents handy than this is a product you should look at. The Avery binder proved to be an excellent product in my possession as it's durable outer shell took as much abuse as I could give it... even when I punched it for good measure to prove a point to my skeptical little brother that not all binders are the same.After two weeks of total usage, and I do mean "total," the rings have yet to wear out and the outer shell is still intact after several "demonstrations" to others.All in all, a quality product. This binder fits the superb Avery reputation, however it doesn't have those extra features that set it apart. This binder:> holds a lot of sheets of paper> opens and closes easily with no gaps in the rings> allows for a cover page with the clear cover on the front of it> allows for a spine sheet with the clear cover on the side of it> stands up to use on a regular basisI will use this binder for marriage enrichment classes my husband and I lead in a volunteer capacity. I purchased this binder to help me organize my papers for work and have been very pleased with it's performance. No three ring binder is special. I bought this binder for my daughter. This is a nice binder, good size, easy to open. I decided to buy her this binder  so a job can just pop out . I will update when she receives it.P.s received the binder, there was many other woman in it but I did not see her name . Maybe I will keep the binder incase I need cooking, my clothing washed. This is a very user-friendly binder. if you need a binder then this is a perfectly adequate on, nothing stand out but also nothing lag behind. I went back to buy another binder. So that was a major plus!Highly recommend this binder! I use this binder at work for a report we create daily and then have to keep for 30 days. This is a three-ring binder that is very sturdy and has a great capacity, with what looks like a good 3 inches worth of paper room before things start to get tight. This is a nice 2 inch thick 3-ring binder that hold lots of my 13 yr old's school projects. This binder has a novel ring configuration which they have given the name EZ-turn. This is a great binder, well-made, holds a lot. You can use these to customize the binder for aesthetics or for quick access to pages of frequently used information.If you are going to be opening and closing the rings often, and don't mind spending a few dollars more, you may want to take a look at the Heavy Duty One Touch EZD line. This is a great binder, it has double slash pockets on the  inside of each cover. I've never seen that in a binder and it's a nice addition. It's a binder. What makes this binder particularly good is the strength of the springs that close the rings. There's not much you can say about a binder, but the rings stay well-aligned, even after a lot of abuse. Using the binder has not only saved me  money and time; it's allowed me to save up an incredible amount of foul language that I'll now have ready for worthier occasions.Waste not, want not. I would think for a more expensive binder like this, it would last several months longer. I really, like this 2", 3-ring binder. Pretty good binder, a little tough to open the rings, but that's probably good because you don't want your pages falling out. Really, this is just the perfect binder for a proper lady. This handy binder appeals to me in several ways. Great binder! The binder I had been using was good but the sleeves wouldn't turn smoothly as they always would "catch" where the binder rings joined. leaving no troublesome protruding edges.This binder is well-made. One can certainly buy a cheaper generic binder at one of the big box stores locally but the rings of the binder WILL pop open when you don't want them to or will not align when you snap the rings closed. Also, the binder part is attached to the back page of the binder rather than to the spine, which keeps pages laying flat when the binder is open.Anyone who has a lot of information they're trying to store conveniently - that they also may need to get at and move around at a moment's notice - this is the binder for you. I chose this binder through the Vine program as I am in grad school and am always in need of binders to store my ever accumulating pile of coursework. This binder is not only beautifully designed (as most Avery binders are) but also durable and practical. This makes an excellent and durable binder for storing coursework (in my case), papers and documents and is practical.

A binder, no less, that they can not even afford for themselves but have to live in one owned by a top 1% male?

@highlight

I'm starting to think this binder only holds women 1% of the time.

Now I know  about the binder of women that I can happily join and never have to bother my silly little head with those decisions better left to big strong men.
