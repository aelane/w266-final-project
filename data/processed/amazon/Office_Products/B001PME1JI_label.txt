I am worried about the label being taken off in the mail, though, so I can't give this product four stars. When I peeled the label back up again after sticking it the corners would wrinkle a little. If the label looked a little crooked the first time, I was able to pull it right up and straighten it out. After you take a label off it starts rolling up a little, but it still worked well and did not look messy or wrinkled.I use labels at home, so I would not go out of my way to buy these, but for an office where hundreds or thousands of them are used for charts, filing, mailings, and other labeling, I think these would be a terrific way to reuse and recycle or just undo a little mistake. The Avery Re-hesive Technology allows the label to be removed and repositioned, so if you place it upside down on the envelope, you can lift it off, turn the envelope upside down and then replace the label. Sarcasm aside, if the label needs to be repositioned or simply removed, this does make that task a snap. Affix the label, attend the situation, remove the label and move on to the next. Avery's got a label for just about every purpose. the label did not leave and residue or marks on the previously pasted on spots, and still pasted on flat after my testing. Being able to reposition a label, without removing and ruining one and starting all over again, is a great idea! Now I now longer have to reprint the label or write it out by hand.

If a label should have come off inside the printer it would be difficult to remove and I didn't want to risk it.

My usual label mistakes are pretty specific to making an error on the label itself which requires reprinting, not repositioning.These labels cost about twice as much as a box of the same size and number of Avery's regular Easy Peel White Address Labels.

For my occasional label mishaps, it would be more cost effective to chuck the sporadic mislabeled envelope and just reprint a new regular label for a new envelope.
