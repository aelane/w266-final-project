I am pleased with this ink. Although ink is fairly standard if just takes a few of the bad cartridge's to sour your whole view on it. This ink seems very solid without any need to take the cart out and shake it or anything. I needed just black ink and works on my Canon Printer. What else more can I say its just an ink cartridge. Unfortunately my Canon Pixma that I bought this for crapped out shortly after purchasing the ink. I am happy that I can count on my Canon ink cartridge to be the correct cartridge, brand new, and works great in my Canon printer After purchasing Brother MFC's (my last three were purchased on Amazon), I decided to try Canon when my last Brother stopped printing due to the ink sponge. Compared to Brother ink, Canon is superior and costs less. The ink should be cheaper - we all know that now and that most printer companies and even computer companies (HP) make far, far more money on ink then they do any of their products. The ink does a good job, as you would expect of ink that is made by the same company that makes the printer it is used in. I wouldn't buy generic ink products, although often tempted to when I see the cost of branded inks. I bought this to replace the black ink in my Canon PIXMA MX512 and it's done a good job.
