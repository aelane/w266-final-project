For what it is, it's a nice stylus. I used the stylus on my iPhone and it worked alright. *The stylus works okay, but it tore a bit when I tried to put it back on after pulling it off (as you would do when replacing it). So for some it may not be cumbersome and not the most comfortable to hold.This is a dual stylus and pen. The stylus is also one of the softest and smoothest I've ever used. I never considered using a stylus. If this is enough to make you curious about using a stylus, then try the Moshi Stanza Duo. For a stylus without a pen, I like theAmazonBasics Stylus for Touchscreen Devicesmuch better. Because of the soft stylus tip that completely flattens with minimal pressure, I rate this MOSHI STANZA DUO at 2 stars ("I don't like it" on the official Amazon scale). The stylus is pleasant to hold and looks great. It comes with an extra stylus tip and clear instructions on how to replace the tip and the ink cartridge.Please let me know if my review was helpful by clicking yes or no. Thinking it worked the same as another stylus I have I pulled it to open up the pen part - and it came apart (you TWIST it for the pen) - anyway, put it back together and took a little more time to look at it closely. The stylus works well and does not seem too soft to me, similar to others I have used.Overall recommended, one star detracted for cost over thirty dollars at present which is more than I've paid for similar units in the past. So this must be the Cadillac of stylus and pens right? I&#8217;m not saying that the stylus isn&#8217;t nice. I have several stylus, some even with a pen built in, however this stylus is the nicest one yet. It is a little heavier and bigger then typical stylus, so you are less likely to lose it in your purse, backpack, murse, whatever.

The stylus is easy to use on any touch screen and I can even write with the stylus on the touch screen (with my note 10.1).The pen part is the part I found most uncomfortable to use for any length of time.

This is a very well constructed stylus.

I tested the stylus on my Kindle Fire and also my iPad Air and it worked very well.
