The white side is the actual eraser, whereas the blue side is supposed to be designed to provide a comfortable grip. The blue side is slightly more rigid than the white, and is supposed to be the surface you hold on to. The white spongy side worked fine- not great, but fine- it took off the marker and left some ghost writing, just like my standard erasers do. The white side of the eraser cleans the board very well with only the smallest amount of pressure. I'm not sure if the blue side of the eraser is meant to clean the board with. Using the blue side with just a dab of water we were able to completely erase all the old permanent marker that had remained on the board over time. The white side was good for erasing something you had just written. You have to use the blue side and wet it, but it really did work.You know there is always someone who "accidentally" uses a permanent marker and then the board is ruined. The white side is an awful lot like the Mr. Clean Magic Erasers - it might be the same exact stuff - not positive - but feels like that texture.Next I brought the erasers to my kids school where they do have terribly stained white boards. You hold on to the Blue side and erase with the white side.These erase a lot better than the fabric or old blackboard type erasers. The 3M Whiteboard Eraser instructs you to wet the white side to remove stubborn ink from a whiteboard, but even that didn't work. One side has a white board. You erase with the white side; the blue is the "handle." I tried the blue side which seems to be more abrasive and it did clean them off without much effort- it did a good job of cleaning up the wet mess that the white side left behind.I find it odd that a pair of sponges would be so pricey and require somewhat a better explanation on how to use them. The whiteboard side has been abused quite a bit with dry erase markers, sharpies and just about anything else my kids can find to draw with. The white side of this is the same melamine foam used in Mr. Clean Magic Eraser (and it's cheaper knock offs). The other side is a polyurethane foam that is supposed to protect your skin from the magic eraser side.I tested it on two dry erase boards that had dry erase marker on them. They seem virtually identical except the blue side of the 3M eraser that you hold on to is much more substantial than the Mr Clean erasers. The white side is the part that gets in contact with the dry erase board. These are very light, and not weighted on one side, so they won't stay on our marker tray. You have to grip the blue side and no matter what I do my fingers wind up touching the white (cleaning side) as well. The blue side affords just a little more friction but not as much as you would think from looking at the photograph which makes it resemble a kitchen non-scrub pad.
