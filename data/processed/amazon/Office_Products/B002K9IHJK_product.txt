These are a great product and am putting them to good use! Definitely, a product that I will be buying and suggesting to friends. This product will be a time saver, plus it will be easier to remove than peeling up the taped-down side. I think overall they are a good product. I am telling you, this is a great product with many, many uses. Great product Great product. I highly recommend this product. Great product. Good product. This is a nice, versatile product. Another great product from Post-it. When I read the product description (at that time there were no reviews) I wasn't sure what to expect. This another good product from Post-it. This product is a perfect solution.The usable portion of the label is a perfect size at about 3" wide by 2" tall. I recommend this product. product. I'm not sure what makes this product that much superior to regular post-its. Excellent product. Overall a great product and I will be buying more in the future. Not a very reliable product yet, needs some more fine tuning. Fortunately, Post-it provides a product that works exactly as it should.I really like these super sticky removable labels. All said, great product I will probably never buy because of the price point. Great product that will the highly organized amongst us to be even more so and for the rest of us , who need lessons in organization ,these will help a lot! They need to work on the above product some more I would not recommend them as they are now. This product is a perfect solution for me. This is an excellent product because the labels are 100% adhesive to the entire surface but can also be re-used frequently.Be sure to locate label exactly where you want it, press down firmly in the middle first, then press down firmly against the remaining surface inside-out.This is a line extension of products that began when a member of a choir who worked for 3M needed something to locate hymns to be sung.I now sing a hymn of praise for all Post-it products. Great product, as expected. I found this product helpful for organizing my crafting supplies. Another solid product from Post-It. )I would highly recommend this product. This product features a full adhesive backing instead of the strip found on most other Post it products. All in all, a useful product. I am very happy with this product as they do stick very well, but they also come back off cleanly and easily, at least on the surfaces I tried them on. Overall, I'm very happy with the product and I know these label pads won't last long around my house.

Where this product shines is in its durability.At the time of this review, my test label has been removed and re-stuck over eleven times, staying on some surfaces for hours at a time, and is still going.

With this product, you can't write the next label out until you've peeled this one off.Next, there's a strange thing they did to make it in pad form - to make it easier to peel off, there is a little tab at the bottom with adhesive and a dashed line to indicate where to tear it off.
