They run through the laser printer easily, without peeling off the sheet or jamming. Although designed for a laser printer, I did try them on an Epson Photo R300 printer. They also work great with both laser and inkjet printers. You can even set most laser printers to automatically print, using the 3M Model No. They are designed for laser printers but will work fine with inkjet or just a pen.A good product at a fair price (at the moment significantly less than the correspondingAvery 2 x 4 Inch White Shipping Labels 250 Count (8163)). They feed perfectly through both my laser and my inkjet printers and are of very high quality. They went through my laser printer with no issues at all. Since I received the laser labels, this is the type of printer I tested them with. They printed perfectly on the laser printer even when printing them using the automatic paper feeder.What is nice about these labels is that they are large enough for small to medium boxes yet still small enough to fit on a business envelope in a pinch. They work with both laser and  inkjet printers. I've used them with both laser and inkjet printers with no problems. While it specifically states for laser printer use, I've used it on my inkjet with no problems. I use these with my laser printer. and with laser labels getting wet is not going to smudge your label. (However I'd still advise setting newer laser printers to thick-paper handling mode when printing labels). I have found that laser printers work fine for both laser and inkjet labels (except you might need to pay attention to paper thickness settings) They print diretly from my laser printer.
