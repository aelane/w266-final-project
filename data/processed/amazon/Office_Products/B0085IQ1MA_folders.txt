There are five folders in a pack. These folders are terrific. That could have been prevented with these folders, since there's a little tab at the top that folds up and down to "lock" your papers in place.As with all the Smead products I've tried, these seem sturdy. While these folders are kind of expensive, I have to admit that they are SUPERCOOL! These folders are made from laminated cardboard. These folders contain a fold-in flap on the inside of the folder which keeps papers secure. These folders are made of a heavy duty, textured, glossy paper. Overall, these are nice folders and I would recommend them. At first I thought these folders were rather nondescript, but upon closer examination the finer qualities began to show. These are nice folders they are heavy and have tabs which will make them easy to find in a binder. These laminated folders are surprisingly strong and sturdy. One of my folders has a pamphlet and a CD that came with a piece of exercise equipment. The folders I own are dark blue and they safely arrived in a package of five. The folders are also made in colors of black, green and red. Fortunately, these folders have oversized tabs for writing the descriptions of their contents.Joseph B. Hoyos These are pretty good folders, and I tend to be hard on office supplies. These are honestly really great folders. These are interesting folders. These Two-Pocket Lockit folders aren't all that different from a standard two pocket folder; they're just a bit more expensive. These are excellently constructed folders. When I take the folders out, the papers won't fall out or fly anywhere. These folders also have the "Certified Fiber Sourcing" label from the Sustainable Forestry Initiative which indicates that "program participants must show that the raw material in their supply chain comes from legal and responsible sources" and that the primary fiber producer is third-party audited to ensure compliance with basic sustainable forestry standards. The Smead SuperTab Two-Pocket Lockit Folders would make perfect folders to hold school or business reports. The folders are constructed like the familiar school folders used to hold school reports except they have side tabs. Inside the folders you will find two pockets to hold your important papers.The folders are a bright blue, almost a purple, making it easy to find a report folder, if you happen to misplace a report folder.Recommend. These folders worked great, and have held up nicely for the past week, tucked inside my son's school binder that he carries with him in a backpack. These folders are a nice and shiny bright blue textured appearance. These are well made folders that hold documents securely. These folders work well. These folders kill two birds with one stone by offering the pockets in addition to a file tab. These folders can be used as regular file folders or as a typical 2-pocket folder. These folders are pretty typical of two pocket folders except for the fact that they have tabs on the side and top for storing them horizontally. These folders far exceeded my expectations. Overall I really like the folders, they're very sturdy and are everything I would expect from a Smead office supply product. These Smead SuperTab folders are unlike any I've seen before. These folders could be very useful if you have the specific need for them.My only quibble is that the laminated surface makes the folders look somewhat cheap, which is not helped by the extremely bright blue color. The folders are also a bit pricy for what they are. These folders are colorful and the tabs are easy enough to write a decent description.

These folders are attractive and can be used in several different ways.

These are basically shiny folders with tabs.

I like that the folders have a loop that can be folded over the top center corner to rein in the loose pages that children seem to generate.The outside of these folders can't be written on with crayons and children's markers.
