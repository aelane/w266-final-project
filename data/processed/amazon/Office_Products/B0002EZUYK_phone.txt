So, the phone rings, you answer and it disconnects the person calling while you are greeted with the "Welcome" screen as the system resets itself. Aside from that, the phone works great, and has all of the features I need. !I'm giving this phone 1 star not for its actual performance, but for the absolutely shameless advertising HYPE around it. Have never owned a better phone. This phone is being used in a small business and has so far been working very well. I have dropped this phone many times from counter height to my hardwood or concrete floors with no ill affects. The phone contacts are the best design I have seen as they always make a connection even if the phone is tilted. Having individual phone books is nice except if you syc them with the base you loose your individuality.

Best phone I've ever usedI've never gotten so excited over a phone before.

On this phone, you can pick up any line like an analog phone, but can easily lock out the other extensions with a privacy feature.It's not just a phone, but a phone system, for which you can buy additional extensions and add them anywhere without installing additional phone jacks.

This phone is perfection.
