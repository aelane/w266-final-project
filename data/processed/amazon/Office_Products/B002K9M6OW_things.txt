What exactly are these things, you ask?It's standard sheets of labels to be used with a computer printer, except the sticky stuff on the back is the same glue used on Post-It notes. OK, these things are sticky. Or maybe you're just packing things for transport.If you use a standard label, it is likely to be a pain to remove when you want to re-use that container. However, they are perfect for labeling things at home, particularly given that all of us need glasses to read but don't always have them on.I will use these labels to distinguish between my medicine and my husbands, to label spices (on top of the labels that are hard to read), and to label both ends of cables that make all the peripherals connect on my pc. I use them for various things, mostly reminder notes. They stick on things yet remove easily with no residue left.The colors are bright and easy to see. I am really impressed with how many new and exciting things Post-It (R) has been releasing. I keep things in colored folders, color-CODED folders, to try to keep straight which class each folder is for. Would also be useful if putting things in boxes such as if moving to a new house or office. Mail things neatly and securely! For many other things, not so much.I have a Brother P-Touch labeler which is great for permanent and waterproof labels (though the refills are ridiculously expensive.

These are good for when you need to label things for short term and want to remove the labels when you are through.

I really like to keep things organized.

These things did that perfectly.Forget the Laser/Ink-jet controversy, I used a magic marker.
