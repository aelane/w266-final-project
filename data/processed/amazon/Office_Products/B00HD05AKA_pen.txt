Still, it's nice to have one pen to carry that does both things well. Then actual pen though writes with a certain cheapness and doesn't have a smoothness that I like in pens. The pen is serviceable and ok but nothing special in my opinion. It has a pen and a nub side. It's a bit smaller than a regular pen. the pen has a great weight to it and a nice size. Really good pen & a great touchscreen stylus. This pen and stylus combination is okay, but I think it's way overpriced for what it is. It's a pen. The pen is decent, but it's not great. And because it is much shorter than a regular pen, the weight is concentrated in a smaller area. You twist the pen and the shirt clip withdraws into the pen, making the entire surface smooth. Just like a regular pen you twist it and the ink comes out the end while the pocket clip retracts, because the pocket clip is actually on to hold it for a stylist so that makes it kind of upside down looking. This all helps me remember not to use the pen, especially since the standard D1 pen feels like it is chicken scratching.One of the selling points to this seems to be that you won't have to carry two writing devices. Secondly, the pen doesn't need to have a cap removed in order to access it. It's very hard to open it and get the pen out. This attractive pen has a quality aluminum finish and neat little extras like a pocket clip that retracts flush with the body whenever the ballpoint is exposed. The pen has a smooth-writing, medium-fine point that I like quite well. The pen is easy to twist up and the stylus end works well. The pen is ok.  You can refill it which is nice as well. But if you are, I recommend you try out this pen.
