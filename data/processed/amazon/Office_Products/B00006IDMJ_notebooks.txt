I've been buying and using their notebooks for years and I'm always pleased. As far as notebooks go, this one is great. Some notebooks have pages that feel rough. It is really up to you if that is worth not buying your notebooks at the dollar store. I've been using spiral notebooks for years and this item I received looks like it may live up to the hype.First of all the cover surprised me. I do have favorite notebooks that I jot stuff in and although this one is too big to carry in my purse, I use it by my desk. I flip my notebooks open the way some people open stuck car doors. I can't stand those wide-ruled notebooks, which make me feel like I'm in 4th grade, and I end up writing larger than I would naturally. Some of the other notebooks have such thin flimsy cardboard these days. When I was in High School, I bought the cheapest notebooks available. These notebooks are very nice!!! I am hard on notebooks.

I have been using Mead Five Star notebooks for many, many years.

I use these notebooks for everything, notes, recipes, memos.

These are good if you are hard on your notebooks, or if you plan to keep them for a long time.
