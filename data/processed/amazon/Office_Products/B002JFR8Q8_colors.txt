It would be nice to have two colors print at once, but that is purely a personal view. The four colors were perfect for just about anything needed during the school day and the ability to have them all in one pen was just plain awesome. The other colors are pretty strong. It's so handy to have 4 colors of ink available at all times, especially when you're working on something that needs to be color coded. That might also happen with the other colors and I haven't noticed it because I don't use them as much.The rest is either subtle or obvious. I love having the four colors available because I can write notes when grading papers and color code the notes (i.e. Having four colors of ink in one pen is handy. I find having four colors in one pen a marvelous way to keep track of characters and other details both in my own fiction writing and reading/writing book reviews. If you use multiple colors to keep track of different projects, you are going to like this pen. I love having 4 colors in one pen--it's great for note taking, list coding, planner prioritizing, and any number of other writing tasks or whimsies. The colors are bright and readable, it's easy to switch between colors, and there's a little loop on the top of each pen so it could be attached to some kind of lanyard if you so desire. I use the same colors on the white board and write separate parts of equations, etc in the different colors. They are easy to use, and who doesn't love having multiple colors to choose from in one pen? What I love is how you get 4 colors all in one pen - black blue, red and green! I got them because they had several colors on ink and I appreciate that when I want to change the color for emphasis. All 4 colors write easily and well, they retract when you click another color. All colors write well but ink flow is typical of cheap ball point pens.Very happy with this product and I would recommend it to friends. Having several colors available at once is super handy when working on a project, and as a Bic product, they write well everytime I use them.

They write well and I like the different colors - though I remember the green and red being more vibrant from my fathers pens of years ago.

Flips colors in a snap.

Even purple might be more useful.But even if I just use the three colors, I'm more than satisfied.
