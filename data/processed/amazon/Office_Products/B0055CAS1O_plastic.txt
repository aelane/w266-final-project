Press down to puncture the plastic and draw the handle, slowly and deliberately around the plastic to cut it open. Big plastic handle, teeny-tiny blade. It doesn't cut all that well through tough plastic--getting it to puncture is hard enough. So far it slices through plastic and tape (on boxes) neatly but it was a little clumsy to handle while I was trying to open a really poorly taped up box that had just arrived. I tried to cut open the plastic strapping on the new box of copy paper - no go. I opened a few plastic packages and it worked without fail. I have never cut myself when opening plastic packages with a razor blade, so that's how I will continue to do it.The design of the package opener is not good and I can't figure out why they decided to make the blade aim down from the handle instead of out the front like everyone is accustomed to from using knives and razor blades over the years.In short, I do not recommend this unit and highly recommend sticking with the razor blade or scissors. This allows you to cut through plastic without cutting into the contents of the package.

Make a lightweight plastic handle with a blade that is sharp enough to open blister packs, while not so sharp as to cut yourself seriously if it slips.

The flimsy plastic ones do not work well with this.

The flimsy plastic crushes inward and I'm unable to get a solid cut through, but only a marking on the plastic.All in all I think this is a good package opener.
