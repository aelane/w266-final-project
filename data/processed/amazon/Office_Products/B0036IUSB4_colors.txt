The bright, vibrant colors in both male and female persuasions gave me some options for who would get what as well. I ordered these because I wanted to cordinate different colors with my outfits, and I was tired of wearing a badge around my neck. While I love the colors and these badge reels are well made and will probably last a long time, in my job as a nurse, I am concerned about the long line on the retractable part of the badge. Now with that being said, again I love the colors and the potential durability of these. The colors on these badge reels are nice and vivid. The colors are jewel toned and can go with so many outfits. The colors are good true colors and the product works as intended. The colors are nice and translucent. Bright colors so you can change up and match with your clothes. I can coordinate the colors with my wardrobe for the day. There are many colors to choose from so that is nice. They are solid-feeling with neat colors, and both the retraction mechanism and the snap are high-quality in feel. I liked the colors on these and the recoil is fairly fast. The different colors offers you the flexibility of matching your different scrubbs!!

The colors are dynamic, but not tacky.
