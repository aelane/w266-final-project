I have stapled as many as 16 sheets and it's just as easy to staple 16 as it is to staple 2.I highly recommend this stapler to anyone who works in an office and uses a stapler as part of their job. It is powerful enough to staple 20 sheets and, so far, there have been no jams. I actually grabbed 20 sheets of used paper (24 lb paper, no less) and gave it a shot. It claims to staple through 20 sheets of paper and it does so easily. several sheets quickly. I love my green one and wondered how much better this EvoLX could be.Wow, I am amazed to say that the EvoLX is even smoother and quieter than my current one - plus it does 20 sheets rather than 15. It truly will go through 20 sheets and very effortlessly! It is rated for 20 but was able to do a remarkable 24 sheets! I was easily able to staple 20 sheets together by gripping the entire stapler with one hand and lightly pressing.The PaperPro also staples perfectly. And it staples just as easily for two sheets as it does for twenty! For what it is supposed to do, staple 20 sheets of paper together, it does beautifully and easily. I was able to staple 16 sheets with the same pressure as one. It performed better with fewer sheets.
