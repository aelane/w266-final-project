The seat back falls back to the low position. The seat pan does not adjust. The seat back does not adjust up enough to come even faintly close to matching the contour of _my_ back. The seat cushion is actually rather short. The seat height adjuster is well executed as well, allowing you to move the chair up and down without having to get up. Also, the seat is way too short for long-legged people. It's also not a deep seat. The seat is very comfortable. The seat back is easily adjustable up and down and the lumbar support is extremely comforable. The seat is adjustable up and down and can either rock or be locked flat. The seat cannot be locked in any reclined position. The seat and back are also padded well and this chair has plenty of maneuverability.

All I had to do was stick the seat onto the base and add wheels.

Narrow seat, small footprint.

The seat cushion is narrow left to right, shallow front to back, and very firm.
