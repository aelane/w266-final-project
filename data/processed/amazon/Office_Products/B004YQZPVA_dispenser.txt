The dispenser is weighted down with pebbles so it can double as paperweight. I have to say I love this Post-It dispenser! The dispenser is weighted so that it stays upright and keeps the Post-Its available. This dispenser is adorable and would make a great gift for a teacher or anyone who loves apples. I like this dispenser because:*The weight keeps it put and easy to pull off the post-its*Fairly easy to reload a new pad*Keeps the post-its handy verses looking in a drawerOther Benifits*Sound drives my cat nuts*Does not drip juice This pop up post-it dispenser looks great on my desk in my classroom, this would make a perfect gift for a teacher. Post-It Pop-Up Apple DispenserWhen I first saw this dispenser, I thought it was very cute but also effective at dispensing pop-up post-it notes. The dispenser is weighted down, so it doesn't move anywhere when retrieving the post-it notes. The dispenser is heavy enough that when I pull a post-it out the dispenser doesn't move and the next note stays intact. This dispenser is heavy enough to allow the user to get a Post-It with one hand when needed, and is more decorative than the usual Post-It holder.The downsides: its footprint is a bit larger than the usual Post-It holder, and also, this dispenser requires the pop-up Post-Its, which don't come in as many colors and varieties as the padded ones, nor have I seen alternate brands available. I brought this dispenser to work and it brightens up my desk and also makes it very easy to grab a note in a snap. The dispenser is made of hard red plastic, but the translucent green stem at the top is a rubbery texture.I really like these dispensers. The 3M dispenser was bigger and heavier than I expected.

If you need a dispenser for post-it's, this will do the job.

This cool little dispenser is filled with weights to keep it from taking flight as it isn't solid, but it functions nicely as both a paperweight and post-it note dispenser.

This dispenser comes with one pad like that.I tend to buy post-its at dollar stores so I won't be able to do that for this.
