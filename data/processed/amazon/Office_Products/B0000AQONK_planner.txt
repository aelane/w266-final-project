I love this because it's a simple planner that is easy-to-use. Then I feel guilty and I stop using the planner and it ends up being thrown away.This will not be thrown away until I have used every single page. The planner is undated, so if you're OK filling it in every day, then this is a great planner. This planner is also very flexible since it is spiral bound which I also like. This planner provides a little bit of structure, but not too much. I love this planner. I've found this planner invaluable for strategizing and completing major and minor projects both. Great planner that can meet varying needs - good for organizing tasks and due dates.

I have never had a daily, weekly,  and yearly planner this comprehensive.

Perhaps that is because this isn't just a planner but a guidebook to help accomplish goals.

What sets this planner apart is the continued focus on daily and monthly priorities.
