The labels are secured together in a glued pad that stays intact until you tear a sheet of four labels off, or peel off an individual label. These labels also have a removable adhesive, so they are easy to switch out without tearing the file folder. These labels are good for that.These file folder labels are color-coded for even more organizing ability. These labels are not for printers however: they are write-on labels on a pad, similar to post its.This makes it easy to quickly stick a label on a file folder or whatever you need, without cranking up the computer and printer.I just purchased a new file folder that did not include labels so I was happy to have these and try them out. Unlike labels I've used in the past,  these will not curl off with time, as these have a permanent adhesive. The labels are bright white, easy to peel off, and 1/3 cut. The Avery labels have been helpful in organizing all the files I keep on everyone... and everything! I hadn't planned on purchasing new labels, but knew, in order to be more readable, whatever I used would have to be on a white background instead of the tabs which came with the file folders.We have 7 file cabinets to keep track of our brood and all the paperwork which goes along with remembering who goes where, when, and with whom! The labels peel off easily and stick tight. These labels are great, and whether it is saving used file folders, or labeling food, they will pay for themselves in a very short period of time. These labels come in a "post it note" format and are very handy to keep around on my desk. I am very pleased with these labels! The labels I have from another manufacturer aren't colored, come on longer separate sheets and don't stick. The Avery labels are more reliable, more convenient, and more functional to use. They're all joined at the top, so if you want to use 6 yellow labels, the sheets with the other colors are still together. They are definitely permanent labels. The labels are easy to write on and come in 4 colors in case you need to color code your files. These labels were perfect for labeling each box so I didn't have to think "Okay, I know I saw X, but where the heck is it?" Having the labels on what is basically the size/shape of a post-a-note pad makes it much easier to write on them and still be able to read your own handwriting. We go through these labels a bunch at the office. Second, the labels themselves are printed in four colors, so for those who plan ahead, they make folder organization tasks just that much more visually organized, which is always a plus. Third, the labels adhere permanently, so you won't find a bunch of labels curled up in the bottom of the drawer underneath a bunch of unmarked folders. These labels are a good tool for helping accomplish that goal. Much better than placing labels on full size sheets. These particular labels stick well on folder tabs and do not smear easily. The labels themselves are 3 3/4" x 5/8 ". I've had some labels that you couldn't write on them with a ballpoint pen.A fantastic organizational helper!Pros:Takes up way less space then your typical label sheets.Large surface area, so even my sprawling script fits on them.Sticks and stays stuck to paper, wood, metal, glass, practically everything.Convenient.Priced extremely well.Cons:None whatsoever. These labels save me money by letting me reuse old folders, and I can keep them on my desk right next to my notepads and post-it notes. I mean they're labels...The down-side is now I have to actually get into my files and R&R; the folder labels ;-), and since most of the folders are many years old, I'll be replacing those too. Putting these labels on a pad was a simple yet great improvement over the past where you would have sheets of labels all over. What else can you say about labels? These labels come in different colors, and are sticky like tape. I like that these labels are cut so that there are only a few for each pad. I'd probably prefer the labels to be all the same color (instead of BRGY), but a very minor quibble. The labels do have various colors, if you choose to sort or organize files by color. The labels can be used on folders, as well as just about anything else. These labels also peel off pretty good without tearing the file folder so you can replace them as needed. And unlike many other labels I've used, these appear to have great stick-ability! These are terrific labels.....they come on a pad, sort of like post-it notes do, but each sheet has 4 different colors of removable sticky labels (blue, red, green, and yellow). I've used these exact labels for years, just in a full sheet form. These are terrific labels. I primarily use folder labels in my home office. For me, this means that I am not creating very many labels at one time, so a full 8.5"x11" label sheet is a waste for me. The labels are mostly white, but have the familiar narrow band of color at the bottom (or top, depending on how you care to orient it):  red, blue, yellow, green.What's new with this product is that the labels are not on sheets anymore, but are on a pad of labels (just a little bigger than a post-it pad). There are four labels, one of each color, on a sheet.This is a clever rethinking of the labels, but each person would have to decide for themselves if there was any realistic use for them in this format as opposed to another. Again, these labels are just what they look like they'd be, from a trusted name. What distinguishes these Avery labels from those of other manufacturers? They peel off more easily than any labels I've tried.2. The labels stick well on file folders and color coding is nice to separate different file folders. These labels are on pad, because of non standard size, are difficult to print in laser printers. I have used Avery labels for years and have been pleased with them. The labels are permanent so be careful where you put them. These labels come in a handy flip pad that holds 160 individual multicolor labels. I would highly recommend these labels for anyone who wants to get organized. Unlike some labels, these were easy-to-peel, didn't smudge when written on, and didn't peel up. I would definitely recommend them over other labels I have tried. These are permanent labels for file folders.They do what they are supposed to do. The labels themselves are put into a 3 inch by 4 inch pad. Each of the 4 labels on each page have a different line of color running across the label top- blue, red, green and yellow. I find the current labels to be a pain to keep organized. The labels are easy to write on (no smudging), though a tad bit difficult to peel off without bending. Avery assorted File Folder Label Pad contains 160 labels and has a compact design.

But seriously, not much to say about these labels except that do what they are supposed to be doing.
