I am running Windows XP SP2 and the 2430PC was recognized when I connected it to my PC.My (minor) grumbles about this printer......Print quality is 180 DPI. While that is not bad at all for a label printer of type, because this one handles true type fonts and even photos, the low print density is noticeable using some fonts which have rounded edges, and of course, with photos. My recent printer I bought didn't and I had to run out and get one.NOTE: This only makes labels up to one inch in width, so if you need bigger labels you'll need to move up to another model. ** Update: 10/2/2013 - I'm still using this and still very happy with the printer. Being a printer, it takes advantage of all the PC housepower in document editing.Pro:1. (1) The printer is rated at 180 DPI, and it shows. The printer automatically cuts off the leading edge so the text is fit to the label.It's nice and small (about the size of a standard brick), and I'll just keep it right next to my printer. The printer comes with a sample 1/2 in. For a portable printer,  this would have been handy.- Approximately 1/4 in. If the printer is showing up as a drive on your computer, then you need to flip the switch to the other position.Pros:- Great labels.- Small unit.- Both the full and lite versions of the label maker software are really nice. It doesn't appear in operating the printer that this waste is required, and the cynic in me wants to think that Brother did this to sell more tape (which is not cheap), but I still like this printer a great deal nonetheless.
