You'll have to decide yourself if the approximately $0.50 extra per pen is worth the bling:-)These the ink from these pens dries quickly after flowing evenly. I love a good pen, and am always in search of a good writing pen. "The pen does not flow smooth on the paper. There is a loud pen scratching noise as one writes on paper. She also opened up the pen and noted a large amount of ink storage from these Japanese made inks which have refills available:Pilot G2 Gel Ink Refill, 2-Pack for Rolling Ball Pens, Fine Point, Black Ink (77240).My husband does a lot of crossword puzzles and loved the pens for the rubber grips; comfortable, no slippage. That was fine though, my favorite pen of all is the Dr. Grip but in a smaller pen, but still with the nice comfort grip. This pen comes up short for me. This is the pen you pull out when you're in the flow and working hard and don't want your tools slowing you down. I always have a pen within striking distance. I'm still using the initial pen I pulled out of the packet, so I do believe that anyone who buys this set will get their money's worth if output is their only desire. What do I want in a pen?Lasts a long time.Fits well in a small hand.Never ever leaks.Good colors for categorized note taking.Reasonably priced.Never gets lost in purse or gets left behind in a store after signing a receipt.What do I not want in a pen?Expensive habits.Too much talking.Gas issues.This pen meets all but one of my "I wants" and none of the "not wants. It ink will smear if you wipe it immediately after writing with the pen, but if you let the ink dry a few seconds it won't smear. Don't you hate it when you reach for a pen and no matter what you do you can't get it to write? Sometimes I'll reach for pen after pen before I find one that does...or give up and choose a pencil instead.Gel pens in general are better. Now I know that when I reach for a pen, it will work.
