If you place the paper on walls/refrigerators, etc. I don't think I'd go so far as to use it on wrapping paper but it definitely is cleaner than grabbing a bottle of Elmer's. I have used it to glue thick paper, typing paper, thin cardboard, and even thin plastic together, all with excellent results as far as sticking goes. Also, paper looked nicer when adhered using the Dot Roller. Right now, I'm thinking ahead to Christmas wrapping paper?!! This works best for paper that need to be glued. Use it on paper because it doesn't "wet" or buckle the paper.Also, if you're having trouble getting it started as I was, check the orientation; I had it backwards, silly me! Removing the paper, the sticky dots remained on the paper, with no residue left on the cabinet. Glue was messy and tended to make the paper wrinkle. good for light paper projects4. If you're working with thin paper and the end product has to withstand hyper-critical scrutiny, this could be a problem. Standard paper sticks fairly quick, and I could not part my test pieces without tearing one. But they work amazingly well to glue paper and other items. Depending on the paper being glued, it can be repositioned for few moments, but quickly becomes permanent.The only issue I've found with this (besides cost) is that the surface on which the adhesive is being applied has to be completely flat, or the glue won't come off the backing properly. It looks more professional - there is no loose paper swaying with a breeze of a fan or the A/C. I guess it's easier to cut off when you lift?However, it's not really heavy-duty, so if you have very heavy paper or something that gets moved around a lot, it may not stay for long.This is so wonderful for projects. It rolls smoothly on both paper and other fibers (ribbon, string, felt, etc.)

Even on lightweight paper such as newsprint the mounting method is invisable.This clever product is designed to replace that thin double sided adhesive tape for mounting use.

One it sets the paper will remain place.

Just make sure you have covered the paper properly or it will lift off.I highly recommend the adhesive roller...  Paper Crafters will never want to go back to glue pensThe only real complaint is the refills are expensive.
