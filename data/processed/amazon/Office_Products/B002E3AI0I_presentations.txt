I can see that in lengthy presentations, my finger will get tired holding down that little button. It lets you easily store your presentations, files so you know they will not get lost.The actual laser is fairly bright. For those of you that regularly give PowerPoint presentations using a laptop connected to a projector, the Kensington Wireless Presenter with Laser Pointer could make life much easier for you.This small Presenter/ Pointer fits neatly in your hand and allows you to switch from slide to slide (and back again) while moving about the room. That's fine for very straightforward presentations, but no more.3) Price: When I first opened this and started using it, I was guessing that it might cost $40 on amazon. I have given presentations and have been using laser pointers for over a decade now and in the past, I have used mainly pen-based red laser pointers. You can store quite a few presentations and it allows you some limited control of your laptop. I've used it for presentations in my classroom and it worked flawlessly - literally just plug-and-play on any computer (I use PC's). If giving presentations is a daily task, the quality and durability of the wireless presenter will quickly overshadow its cost. If you regularly give presentations via your pc then you should have this type of tool. If you have to do electronic presentations this product is a must buy. If you're just giving presentations, in my opinion, you can't find a better solution.The Kensington Wireless Presenter is a great design:- provides 3 buttons (reverse, forward, blank display) as well as a laser pointer- it's EXTREMELY comfortable: it's solid, contoured to your hand, with a rubberized finish that doesn't attract fingerprints or easily slip from your hand- it connects to your Mac or PC via a USB dongle that also has 1GB of flash storage for transferring presentations- the USB dongle stores inside the presenter body: this also acts as the power switch - when you remove the dongle, it powers on the presenter- it uses RF technology, so you can be up to 60 feet away from your laptop (although I wasn't able to test the real range)- it uses 2 AAA batteries (included) which Kensington claims should last up to a year of avg use- out of the box, no drivers are required in either Mac or PC (not all presenters are Mac-compatible), it actually simulates an additional USB keyboard, with 3 keys: left arrow, right arrow, and B (blank display)- GREAT value for the priceWhat could be improved?- 1GB of storage is pretty small by today's standards - I assume that Kensington will eventually refresh the product with higher capacity- the buttons do NOT auto-repeat if you hold them down, so you must click each time to quickly advance back and forth; this can be painful on a slide with lots of animations- there is no option to map keys if you need to ... to be fair, both PowerPoint (Mac & PC) and Keynote (Mac) worked fine in my tests- my unit arrived with dead batteries, not a big deal but initially a new replacement set of batteries didn't work either - eventually i got the unit to turn on. I know 1 GB is capacious for PPT presentations; but flash memory is cheap. For important presentations, make SURE you put a fresh set of batteries in so there are no unfortunate lapses when you're 30 feet away from your laptop.On the whole, a terrific little device--one which should be part of every presenter's arsenal.
