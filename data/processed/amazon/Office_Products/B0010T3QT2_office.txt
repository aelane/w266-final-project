The seemed expensive to me, but I looked at the office supply big box stores, and these are pretty on par for similar products, so 5 stars! To compare, I tested my old generic office supply store envelopes and the Quality Park envelopes did outperform them in that regard. Regardless, they are definitely better than the office supply store branded ones I use and they are more convenient. How it can be cost effective to import office supplies from Germany to the US is a bit of a mystery to me, but so it must be. Here at Chez Delamaine we go through office and shipping supplies fairly rapidly. I have seen Quality Park envelopes at the local office supply big box, so I knew these weren't that cheap. Typically when purchasing office paper products I like product that have recycled content. I like to review office supplies so I was glad to be able to review these envelopes.They are long ones, 4.25 X 9.5 inches, white.

Unfortunately, I am an "organized, office person" (at home), and I like for all my supplies to be organized and handy.

I currently use generic office supply store envelopes andColumbian Inkjet/Laser Printer Envelope, V-Flap, #10, White, 100 per Box (CO138)for running through the printer.

The office supply store ones will get all creased going through the laser printer, so that's why I buy the Columbian brand.I first used these envelopes through my HP Officejet Pro K5400 inkjet printer.
