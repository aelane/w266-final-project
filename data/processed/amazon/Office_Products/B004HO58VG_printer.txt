Yes, they don't care if you can use your printer, but they really want to get your name and address and will give you a direct link to their website. This printer is suitable for a small home office. The printer comes with two standard size ink cartridges (XL versions are available for re-order), a USB cable, a phone cord, and a sample box of small photo paper. It prints around 8.5 on the new printer scale in black, and about 4 when printing black. The printer is designed such that the input and output trays are at very steep angles, so they don't take up as much room.The printer has a nice feature where one can press a single button and scan to a selected PC connected to the home network. The printer can connect to Bluetooth devices - but needs an optional Bluetooth module, so I could not test it.The printer does not use a power "brick", so the power cabling around the printer is clean.Con:There is no backlight for the LCD display, and I found it hard to read without shining some additional  light. Select the printer and hit next. Good printer Canon is a good brand and I've never had any problems. I recommend this printer HIGHLY for everyday document printing and photo printing(photo printing consumes more ink)its a good deal for the price. I have to admit that this printer scared me right out of the box. Hard wiring this printer is a snap. I am very happy with this all in one printer, and I highly recommend buying it right here on Amazon... This printer for the price has got to be the best of its kind on the market. Taking this printer out of the box, everything about it felt cheap. You can search the printer itself, even take it apart, and you won't find a network connection. Finally I shut off the printer and fully rebooted it.

I got this printer not as a replacement, but a supplement to the brother laser printer I already have.

If you are looking for a printer that can give you really nice images (something that you will use specifically for photo printing) then you might as well splurge and get something that will give you amazing resolution.

While this printer is not bad at all, you will be much more satisfied with splurging a little more for DOPE resolution.So, this combo is very nice.
