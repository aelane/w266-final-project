Also there is a pocket in the back as well. Handy pocket in the back of the book (inside back cover) for storing loose pages. And there is a small "back pocket" for putting extra paper in.For the price though, I would have wanted something else inside... like paper the correct size, and maybe some mini-dividers, and mini sheet protectors to get you started. and why only one pocket? The pocket serves the same purpose as the completely detachable, 3 ring pencil zip holders that are available, but is an integrated part of the binder. The pocket is the only part of the product that I worry about in terms of long-term durability; however, it is very convenient. The pocket closes by slipping an elasticized band over a button. There's even a special pocket for standard 8.5 x 11" papers that doesn't require holes punched. This has a pocket which helps in storing small things like pen, pencil, erasers, cell phone, calculator etc. The  pocket closes with a string wrapped around a button, (I don't know what they're called, you see them everywhere) so it is secure enough to keep your credit card or phone from falling out. The pocket inside the binder is very sturdy and would hold a number of different supplies. It features an expandable pocket for holding small work tools such as calculators, pencils and pencils, paperclips, etc. There is an opaque pocket on the left that will hold a few small items and has a rubber band style clasp. The pocket on the right is pretty tight and will only hold a note or two.The rings open and close easily but are firm once closed.A great little binder for taking up less room in a briefcase or to organize shopping notes and coupons, recipes or whatever you need to organize. When full, it looks like the pocket can extend out about 1 1/2 to 2 inches. There's even another open pocket for slipping in a few lose notes on the inside right. The pocket isn't the typical half-pocket. But if the pocket storage is important to you, then it's a great choice. The back pocket is quite thin (holds about 6 pieces of paper). I like that it has the clear pocket on the front, so I can create a cover for it. What I really like about it is the pocket inside that expands and has a secure clasp. The pocket is about 5" x 8" and will all kinds of office supplies like a calculator, ruler, pencils, etc. In the pocket I have scissors, tape measure, miscellaneous crochet hooks, stitch counters, and other little items. I don't care for the pocket provided inside but this is no fault to the product but rather, personal preference.

When you open it, there is a standard pocket on the right which might hold a sheet of paper or two.

The pocket expands maybe 1/2 inch.The binder appears made well.

It seems sturdy and the pocket is useful, although small things can escape the pocket.
