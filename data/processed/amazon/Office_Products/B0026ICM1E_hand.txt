It also feels nice in your hand. I write with a very heavy (left) hand and have had zero luck finding a mechanical pencil that will take both the pressure and angle of writing I use and not smear as I go.This mechanical pencil managed the pressure, angle, grip, didn't smear and did exactly as advertised, kept a sharp point the entire time. On the other hand, it is a bit pricey for folks for whom regular old number 2's are fine.If you're middle of the road on this topic like I am, you'll get a lot out of this pencil. Because I have a heavy hand that continually breaks the lead in the pencils. It's snazzy looking, fits nicely in the hand and the lead is manipulated through a top button that also contains an eraser. It fits in my hand well and feels good in use. It feels good in my hand, it is easy to load with new leads and works very well. I've got a heavy hand when I write. Maybe it's because I'm left-handed and curve my hand around when I write (bent wrist instead of straight wrist...lefties will know what I mean) or maybe I'm just indelicate. I wrote in my normal hand and I pressed hard intentionally and all that happened when I did the latter was I got a darker line.The point stays sharp too, as advertised. I guess you can remedy that by just keeping a hand eraser nearby.

It also rests easy in the hand with it's smooth, feather-light feel.

With hand issues, I need a mechnical pencil with a thicker barrel.
