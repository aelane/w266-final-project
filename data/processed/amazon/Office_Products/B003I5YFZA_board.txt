This board is the perfect size to place in your kitchen, and the neon dry erase markers are bright and attention getting, which helps if you are trying to leave someone else a message on the board.Our board also does double duty as an erasable coloring board for my youngest daughter. The board itself is nice, however the neon markers just don't show up as nicely as a regular whiteboard marker on a white surface does. It's a black board, colors look kinda cool, teenager likes it in his room. Wiping the writing off the board was easy and the marker residue came off clean. We keep our board on the frig with appointments and family events and have to put the markers in a "junk drawer" next to the frig. The board is the black version of the traditional white board with an aluminum frame. This writing board and marker set is a fun alternative to the usual dry-marker board product. I change the board frequently, so I wanted something small, bright, and easy to clean. This board and markers fell flat. The board is lightweight enough that either the included magnets or sticky strips are good enough to hold it in place. The board is magnetic, the markers aren't. The board comes with 2 magnetic strips, but these don't stay stuck to the rounded body of the marker.4.) The board size is just a bit too small. The black board is framed with a silver metal material. It is very light weight.-The black board is easier on the eyes versus the standard white dry erase boards available.As said before, I have it placed on my refrigerator, which is black, and it blends right in. I use this relatively small sized board in my kitchen. The board does come with adhesive strips, but I don't really have anywhere to hang this board up in the kitchen.Prior to this black board, I used one of the same size in white. The black board and neon ink definitely stand out in my kitchen. I guess I was expecting the whole board to be magnetic, but you have to peel and affix mounting strips to magnet strips, then affix THOSE to the cardboard backing of the board. Catchy black board with neon dry erase markers, more eye catching for those important family reminders. Still, I like the board, reasonable price, and we will use it. The board is a nice size, and finish is good, however the markers are a bit dull in color.Still very nice for leaving a note or shopping list.I would buy again. It's a purple dry-erase board with a black marker that comes with a tiny eraser on the cap, which isn't perfect but it does the job if I don't want to get my big eraser. I use this board to practice homework with my 1st grader. I much prefer this to a white board! This one is only useful for the latter.The board came dented and dinged, and there is no ledge to store the markers on. Either the board would break from being dropped repeatedly or I would get angry and throw it away.When Amazon offered me a Sanford Neon dry erase board, I did not have high expectations. However, I have to say I was quite surprised.We put the board on the fridge and slammed the door a few times and the board actually stuck. I highly recommend this board. I couldn't wait to put this magnetic board up on my fridge or maybe my office storage cabinet. The board is framed in light silver so harmonizes with a stainless and black refrigerator very well. The Dry Erase note board is 8.5" x 11" which is a convenient size. It's unusual in that the board's background is black. I was looking for a board to post my to-do list. The board never made it to the kitchen (as suggested on the product, and what I had originally planned), because it claimed a spot on the teens' bedroom door, letting me know that the space was off limits to parents, that some visitors were welcome, and that a certain music group rules.The markers provide a nice effect, appearing to "jump" off the board, although not with the same intensity one sees with the more expensive dry erase boards. (this board appears to be a composite cardboard material with a black plastic surface) Of the three markers provided, the orange is the most visible. The board itself is not magnetic, the term refers to the adhesive magnetic strips supplied to mount the board on a steel surface; we used dual sided tape strips, which worked well enough with the lightweight board.I can't comment on the long term durability of this item, but it looks as if it will last until the teens decide to redecorate their living area, which can be anywhere from three months to two years. The magnetic board holds well and overall this is a good functional product. The board is not large, by any means, you can get 1 - 2 sentences written in a size younger kids can read, but for small projects or needs it works great. They are extremely bright if you use them on a normal white board, which I decided to test to make sure it wasn't the markers, and its not, its just that its on black, and you really can't help that.Other than that, they write pretty well, they seem just a bit drier than my other markers, so you kind of have to press harder than other markers, or at least my other markers to get them off, but that is also a very minor complaint, and hardly worth mentioning. I use Post-Its quite often, but this board is a great way to jot down quick messages without wasting paper. They will serve well when a white board or black board is used to draw the eye. The black board works better with the neon colors, but if you use a paper towel or dry board eraser on the black board provided with this kit, in short order it becomes a dark shade of grey. This board is great in a lot of ways! This is a great little board. The board seems very well made. The board works well for what it's for. The board erases cleanly, the markers are bright and the colors are cool. I use it as my "must do" board...showing the essential work-type things I must complete before I can answer personal email, review something for Amazon, fall asleep at my desk, etc.I formerly listed these tasks on Post-Its, but found those treacherous little bits of paper to be completely untrustworthy. This black board is great for posting quick notes, or chores, for the family! The board measures 8.5" by 11" and is small enough to go to the dorm or office environments. This board is fantastic for making quick notes to my wife, jotting down a phone number or a quick grocery list.The neon markers themselves are just like regular dry erase markers only maybe slightly more oily. This black board is basically like a white board but in black. This bright black board was the first time I used such a product. It's also erasable with a regular board eraser, which brings us to topic of the missing parts...There is no eraser in the package. Also the board does not come with any accessories to hold the tree markers. The board came with two types of mounting options--sticky pads or magnetic strips--and the board itself is magnetic. Easy to read, definitely.The board itself is well enough made w/ a brushed aluminum frame & stiff cardboard backing. The approximately 8.5 x 11 inch dry-erase board is a good size for jotting down reminders or grocery lists. Because of the board's small size, this is acceptable. On the other board, the whole thing kept falling off the fridge and I ended up throwing it away in a disappointingly short time.Although I hadn't really considered how cool the color black would be, it looks great in my black-and-stainless kitchen. I love the black board and the bright, vibrant colors -- and so do my kids.
