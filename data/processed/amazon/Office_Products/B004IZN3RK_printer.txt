I'll admit I'm still not happy listening to the printer pump away for a minute or two as it's getting ready for the first "different" print and know it won't happen again until I have to switch back to the other kind. Although this is a wireless printer, the quick start instructions recommended using a USB cable for the initial setup. Rather than move the printer, I connected the printer to my router with a long Ethernet cable and the initial setup then went like a charm. The printer also came with a more detailed 68 Page instruction book.My wife has an iPad and iPhone and attempted unsuccessfully to wirelessly print from these devices this Epson printer. This is a great printer. While this printer may be overkill for most people who just want print occasional pictures of the kids, having 9 ink cartridges printers is huge improvement over the 4 ink cartridges printers. If you use Lightroom/Photoshop with SilverEfex, I highly recommend this printer to you.I wanted to step up to a challenge and purchased the Epson Canvas Paper rolls. If you bought the printer for say $800 and you've gotten your per-8x10 supply costs down to $1.15, then you'd need to print about 2,580 8x10's before your total costs started to get lower than Sam's Club's $1.46.When you get larger than 8x10 though then the printer really starts to pay off. My first Epson printer was the R320. It is also especially helpful because this printer is a large format printer that would take up a great deal of room in my workspace if I had to have it close enough for a cord. This is a big and heavy printer, so you need to be sure to have plenty of room for it. This printer is indeed quite large and weighs a ton. With a printer this large, you do want the option of placing it where you have space.
