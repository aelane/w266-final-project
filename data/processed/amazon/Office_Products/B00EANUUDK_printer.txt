I also need a printer that can fax and make copies. I like this one so much that I gave my old printer to a relative.I am very pleased with this printer. We bought this printer as we have used them in job-site offices. I've found this printer to be a good addition to my arsenal. This is perhaps the fastest and easiest printer install I've ever done. The printer box has been sitting on the living floor near the front door for a couple of weeks because the box was so huge I became concerned about where I would put the printer. This Brother printer looked huge but it was working within 45 minutes of taking it out of the box. It searches for your printer and once you select it, you can print the page. I love this printer and would buy it myself in a heartbeat! The Brother MFCJ6920DW Color Inkjet printer was extremely easy to setup. My Mac's all found the Brother printer with no problems. This printer replaced an older HP that I always had problems finding from my Mac. This Brother printer is yet another solid option among many in a competitive market. The printer is about the size of a 10 ream case of LTR paper if you add 4 more inches of width. We will only use this printer for scanning and printing the occasional documents instead of a more regular use because of the ink capacity compared to the far greater capacity of a toner cartridge.
