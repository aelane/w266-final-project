This is a wonderful little workbook for kids who are just learning to write. This workbook is a perfect "at home supplement" for my young daughter. The workbook itself is also high quality, with full color and thick pages. The first 1/4 of the workbook is set up this way. This workbook suitable for age 5-7 yrs old. Nice workbook to practice writing. We opted to not purchase this workbook for our other two children when they reached five years old - instead, following a similar format, we used cheaper writing sheets and encouraged the kids to draw pictures, and then write in the associated words. I thought this workbook would be great to help her expand her writing. We LOVE HWT, but when I introduced this workbook, she became excited and has repeatedly asked to use it. A great workbook for preschool/kindergarten/1st grade kids and is an excellent idea generator. This workbook has 48 sheets with writing prompts and structured lines. This workbook is best for children who are just starting to write their ABCs and to older kids who just started to write on their own. Most of the workbook is like that, along with some fill in the blanks, and even some pages that emphasize sequencing.

I am also impressed that this workbook starts off with the mechanics of writing and ends up with the creativity of writing.We have started taking the MEAD EARLY LEARNING IDEA BUILDERS STAGE THREE WORKBOOK with us where ever we go.

This workbook is an introduction to creative writing, prompting children to think of different words related to the same subject.
