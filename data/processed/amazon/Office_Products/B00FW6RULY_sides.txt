The sides of the mail holder are open so the holder can accommodate larger items such as magazines. The sides are open and mail can slip through the sides. The sides are open so even larger papers can fit. It is also open on the sides, which may or may not be a good feature, depending on how you are using it. When I got it, I was disappointed that the sides were open. It is not closed on the sides, but that actually works better for me, because them nothing it too big for it, and nothing gets lost inside of it. Nothing gets wrinkled from being crammed in, due to the open sides. With the open sides it makes it easy to accidentally pull out other pieces of mail then the one you intended to grab.Still, if this is the product you are looking for, it's perfect.

I don't like that the sides are completely open.

It's not that big, and is open on the sides, though the magnet on the back is large enough to hold the thing firmly in place, so as long as it's straight when you slap it onto your fridge, you'll eliminate any danger of papers falling out should the pouch be jostled.There's really not much to say here.
