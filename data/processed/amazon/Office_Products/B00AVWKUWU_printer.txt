So if you want to connect this printer using USB, you have to provide your own cable. The MX522 is not the fastest printer out there. The Canon PIXMA MX522 is a great little printer. This printer is easy to use and incredibly versatile.The only drawbacks are the weight and the usual "cartridges of ink are pretty expensive for the miniscule amount of ink you get". That said, we're extremely happy with this printer. Great printer for quality pictures and everyday home printing. Yes, I would recommend this printer on the quality, brand, and ease of use. This printer has a little smaller profile than its hefty big brother, theCanon PIXMA MX922, taking up less desk space. For me, this printer seems to fill the home user slot. I have never had a Canon printer before. The printer prints quick enough for me considering it is not a laser printer, and the quality is quite good in my opinion. the printer is made very well easy to set-up and to get all the software that go with it to work well worth th emoney This printer has been a big disappointment for me so far. The printer seemed to be fine, so I went ahead and set it up and tried it out. I decided to return the printer and buy an un-damaged one.At the same time, I was offered a chance to try this Pixma. This was a slightly more expensive printer, and I trust Canon to have great photo quality. I added the printer and scanner to my Print and Scan system module, and I was able to print and scan anything I wanted--even scanned a multipage document after I inserted it into the document feeder. The printer is AirPrint compatible right out of the box. It's a pretty big printer, but it feels solid and better constructed than the bare bones model.It's still a bit louder than I would like but it is a big improvement over what we had. The printer does very well what it does (not including the fax because I have not tested that), but there are some things you should know if you are considering purchasing it:1. What is not said is that if you are going to be using the printer with a computer still running XP that in order to open the software on the disc that connects the printer to the computer you must have Service Pack 3. This was much appreciated by me since the printer will be used entirely for office type printing so, for example, the 680 MB "My Image Garden" is not needed. So when you install the printer, give some thought to how it will be used so that you include only what you need. If you are replacing a printer, just use the same cable that you used with the other. Because I was connecting the printer to a computer running XP, it took me a long time to complete the installation. It is a new printer, on the market only since January, so I am hoping that is the reason and that there will soon be less expensive alternatives.All in all, this is a very good multi-function printer/scanner/copier/fax. I have been using the printer daily for over a week now and have found nothing aobut it I do not like. Neither printer required any physical connection to the router nor any computer for Network set up.There are lots of options for both printers--the trouble is, with the 452, it's hard to maneuver the menus because it is hard to see the screen. My current printer has this, and once you have had it, you don't want to go back.The Fax programs are the same, and work equally well. BUT there are many differences.If you are looking for a utilitarian-looking printer, the PIXMA MX452 is a good choice, but the screen is not very easy to read, and you have to do a LOT of scrolling to get through the menus. I found this printer to be very easy to set up and install the cartridges. This printer is very pleasing to own and I am pleased with it. I like this printer because of its ease of set up and operation. Believe me, this is a "No Hassle" Photo printer and I recommend it if you're looking for a great wireless PHOTO scanner/printer.All in all, I like the convenience of having good quality photos printed at home. I love my new printer! This printer is not an exception. These appear to be easily breakable, and you definitely cannot leave them set up unless you have a printer table that extends beyond the farthest reach of the paper feed.I like this printer very much. Regular came with the printer, and those got used up quickly. When I received this printer, my mother was visiting. Since I never need to actual manhandle the printer and it looks and runs great otherwise, that's a minor concern for me. Second, the printer uses on two ink cartridges... one for black and the other for color. This is my first printer in years that uses a single cartridge for all the colors and since I'm well aware that colors don't run out all at the same time, I know that ink will be wasted when it comes time to replace the cartridge. This is my third all-in-one printer and my fifth Canon printer.
