I love this smaller new cutter. This is an excellent cutter and I love how the ruler slides for longer measuring but I especially like the feature where you can actually lift up the whole arm and blade (completely off the board) so it doesn't catch when you slip it through to place it for cutting. Using just the cutter might result in a messy cut.Great item for quick, easy use! This cutter has a trough where the blade goes, so you can kind of see the line, but why oh why isn't there a clear plastic fold-up overlay at the edges of the cutting line that has a dark line showing you precisely where you will be cutting? There must be a cutter that has such a device, I just haven't found it yet.Anyway, that aside, for the price, this is a great little cutter. One is a cutter and I found it did a very good job cutting 4 sheets of 20 pound paper; it cut 5 sheets as advertised by I had to go slow because it wanted to bind up a bit.The other blade is for scoring. The cutter does a clean job on paper and card stock as well.They don't require much pressure and they cut and score a clean line with no buckling or warping.For the price and for moderate projects, this will do the job. I know this is a light-duty cutter, but the blade that comes with the trimmer seems a bit limited in the number of clean cuts you can make before it starts to get dull. I love that it not only has a cutter but a scorer as well, which is great for card making, paper folding, etc.There is an arm to the left that swings out so you can cut larger pieces of paper, I'm not certain how well this arm will hold up, but for now it's working just fine.The blade cuts very well, and it is quite easy to use.I am happy about the product, for the price, definitely worth it. Unfortunately, it just doesn't hold up to my larger Bidex cutter that I adore.With this one, there is such little "guide area" that the paper is nearly impossible to line up straight and to hold there. The cutter blade works as well on thick and thin paper. Since I use this cutter mostly for cutting, I think it's a good value. I have another Westcott cutter, and the blade is in the middle of the trimmer handle, so it is not exposed unless you put your finger in the gap in the paper holder.
