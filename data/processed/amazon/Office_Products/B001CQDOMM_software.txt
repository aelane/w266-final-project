The software isn't really much different than my all-in-one printer as they both do OCR and tagging, but the ability to take it with you makes this a better priduct for those of us who like to do our work on the go or who do sales trips. If the software was a little better or the scanner had higher resolution (and color) then it would be five stars. The software is simple to use, and a dedicated filing cabinet that is easy to navigate. I think I'm going to continue using the software for financial stuff- receipts, statements, etc... and keep those docs separate from my big, teetering stack of Evernote notebooks.The scanner size is so convenient! Ok, Ok, it comes with Optical Character Recognition software (OCR) built in, but this goes way beyond that. The software actually "reads" the receipt and helps you organize it.But I get ahead of myself.First, I am a spaz when it comes to software, so it better be easy to install. Since I already had the NeatWorks software installed, the unit was basically plug and play for me, with the exception of a required calibration that only took a few seconds. I was impressed that they responded on a pre-Memorial Day Sunday, but I wanted to ask them when this new software would be released and whether or not the upgrade would be offered free of charge to existing users. Again, the software's not quite there yet, but it's solid in many respects and it sounds like they're working on fixing the shortcomings.I'd definitely recommend this product. Were it not for the software issues, I'd give it a 5 star rating. The software is designed to serve as an archive manager for everything you scan into your computer. Loading and getting the software up and running for the scanner was surprisingly tedious. The software prides itself on word recognition to fill data cells - but on my first attempt it failed to recognize both the name of the business AND the total charge of $25, listing instead nothing for the name and a charge of $5. Paperless, and you probably already have the software. I also have not yet had to deal with a major software update and the reported losses of data, backward compatibility, or other problems. This can be done manually within the software but that means looking at each receipt and calculating the portion that belongs on a certain tax line, business expense category, etc.The other thing I would recommend is to get into a routine with your scanner. I started by downloading the latest software from the website - didn't bother with the included disc. The software is pretty good at extracting data for the vendor, date and price but seems to have issues with sales tax. The software is actually pretty cool. The NeatWorks software has direct hooks to work with Fujitsu's line of ScanSnap document scanners; I look forward to trying that in the future.ScanSnap S300M Clr 600DPI USB 10PG Adf Mobile ScannerFujitsu ScanSnap S1500M Instant PDF Sheet-Fed Scanner for the MacintoshThis item is a pleasant surprise, and I recommend it to anyone who would like a little help in organizing their routine business tasks, and to have a little fun doing it. After that, you run the software, plug in the scanner - which has no ac adapter and runs entirely off USB !! I haven't used the software too much, since I have just wanted PDFs so far (there are two buttons on the scanner, one for scanning and one just for PDFs).Note the scanner only does one-sided.The scanner is tiny. The software itself is noticeably scant on details about how these work or how to make custom ones...One strange note for Mac users: I can't for the life of me figure out why the Neat software wants/needs access to contacts in my Address Book. The software is powerful, well developed, but every company may have their own expense reporting for example, and this may or may not be helpful for you. But if you need powerful software, the package with this device is far more than you get with the Scansnap. They could probably sell the software for the price of the bundle. But Neat kept bugging me to "update" the software so I did. The software is so bad they have videos for you to learn how to use it. Regardless the software installed from that downloaded copy without issue, including offering the chance to download an updated version (as would have happened if I had gone through the installation process from the cd). After the software was installed, I proceeded to hook the scanner up to the PC and continued through the 'Getting Started' guide that came with the device and software. With the software installed the next step is the process of calibrating the device and that is where the first real stumbling block comes into play. Additionally the Neat Receipts software's ability to turned scanned information into database records makes searching for information possible and that too is quite useful.
