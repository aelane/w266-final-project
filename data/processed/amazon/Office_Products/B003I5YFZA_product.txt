Sanford Expo Neon Markers with Magnetic Dry Erase Board is a nice product for daily note keeping and daily reminders. Still, this is a nice, handy product that helps keep your life organized. The product is small and a little pricey for the size. For now, it's a fun product but not something I would recommend at this time. I have it mounted on my fridge.Great product! I use this product in my classroom in small groups. Well made product. If you are wanting a simple product such as a dry erase board, but with a slight twist, then  this product will work for you!!! I received this product from the Amazon Vine program and was instantly impressed when it arrived. When I saw this product was a black dry erase board, I thought the colored markers would be very bright and jump right off the board, but that is not the case. This is an interesting product which can be used like a mini blackboard that uses florescent markers which wipe off with a dry paper towel. Super product. Defiantly a product I will continue to use and buy more of. This is a handy product. It would make the product a bit more expensive (though I can't imagine much more), and it would be much more convenient for the user.
