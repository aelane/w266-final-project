The laser pointer fits comfortably in my hand, better than smaller pointers which I tend to fumble with. The laser pointer itself is a basic pointer, no highlighting or underlining feature.If you do multimedia, interactive or embedded-video presentations I would recommend a presenter with more features or an airmouse. This is more than a laser pointer-it actually gives the presentation. Especially those are used to spending less than $10 on a red pen-based laser pointer. Would you pay over $50 for this laser pointer and its functions? The Kensington laser pointer definitely has the feel of quality about it. A laser point comes in under 10 bucks and you can choose your own color. It also includes a laser pointer that you can use to highlight something in your presentation.Pros:1) Fits very nicely in the hand and small enough to fit in your pocket while you're not using it2) Looks good3) Comes with the batteries4) Stores the USB receiver inside while not in use5) Low battery indicator6) Memory on the receiver is a nice touch. This includes the laser pointer. The green laser may or may not be brighter than the red one. The laser pointer is great, and if you're like me and don't have a very steady hand, you'll find the comfortable grip makes this one easier to point with than the little stick pointers. It worked flawlessly!The laser pointer function of the Presenter works amazingly too.I just love the fact that it required no additional software to be installed, worked first time without any fiddling around and I can switch between my Mac and PC with the same device! I've tested the laser and the functions at up to 25 feet without any problems. The laser is plenty bright, even in a bright room.2. The Kensington Wireless Presenter Pro with a green laser pointer is the first Kensington branded product that I have ever used. I have experienced laser pointers that were satisfactory and some that were utterly useless. The laser is very strong and great for annoying your co-workers who might be nodding off during your presentation :-) In all, a fun and useful gadget that tucks nicely into your briefcase. The green laser pointer is a nice change from the usual red.The Presenter is very useful and intuitive. When you need to use the laser pointer, push the button. This means that the laser pointer can only be used with the USB drive out, though it doesn't need to be plugged into a computer. Kensington apparently does as well, as they chose to use a very low powered red laser, which is common in combination devices like this one. Given that a green laser can be found for around $10 shipped online now, this is unacceptable. A more powerful red laser, which costs almost nothing now (under $5), would have at least made this more practical. If I were to use this as it is, I would have to hold a separate laser pointer in my hand as well.However, I will not be using this presenter. Does what you need for a laser point for presentations. This is a wireless laser pointer for use in presentation, and an upgrade to theKensington 33374 Wireless Presenter with Laser Pointer. The built in laser pointer makes it easier than having a separate laser pointer. The laser pointer also worked well and I very much appreciate the addition of a usb receiver that has storage space for documents and/or files. The green laser is very strong and even from across the largest rooms will point clearly and accurately at your target on the screen. K72336US)The laser is green and astoundingly vivid.

Now, I don't have to carry a laser pointer, the Apple control, and a thumb drive.Cons: For the price $75 on Amazon, it should have a nicer design and larger storage capacity, and function as a wireless air mouse.Admittedly, I am biased toward the Apple brushed aluminum uniblock design.

Except as a laser pointer.
