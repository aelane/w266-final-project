Little tabs hold it in place. The tabs are a double layer of the file material. 1/3-cut sturdy tabs in assorted positions provide for easy, neat, and clear labeling. You can either write directly on the tabs or write on tab labels (sold separately) and stick them on the folder. Permanent tabs are great and the fact that they glued around the rods makes it durable. But how much do those plastic tabs really bother you? Since the tabs are permanent, I would suggest using a removable file folder label on the tabs, especially if you are color coding your filing.The folders appear to be well made and meet my expectations for this type of product.There are 18 folders per box, 6 each of red, blue and green. The tabs are a part of the hanging folder, permanently. I like the larger tabs, it makes it easier to write on, they seem fairly sturdy and should last for quite a while using them at home. The tabs are larger than other hanging folders I've seen. The tabs on these folders are slightly larger than the "regular" ones, making it easy to write on them with a marker. will be impressed with the built in tabs that are sturdy enough to write on and have enough area to write and label on. You can file, write on the tabs without dealing with having to deal with making the tabs yourself, and file easily in a file cabinet. (However, the FasTabs with shorter tabs might have more positions, I don't know as I haven't tried them. As the tabs are part of the actual folder, the folders look nice and clean and no worry with snagging on an insertable plastic tab while putting papers in or out. The tabs are fixed in place, which means you loose a bit of flexibility as you set up and then rearrange files. The tabs are generous and easy to write on (but you'll want labels for when you change the purpose of the folder.) I really like the built in tabs...they are a wonderful feature. This means that all of the tabs are easily legible.I tried the Smead FasTab hanging folders in my fire safe and found the same result- they fit *perfectly* inside the allotted space and the tabs do not get bent down.The folders are quite large enough to hold more than an inch-thick pile of documents which is great for storing periodic receipts such as monthly bills.The included three colors come in Left, Right, and Center-oriented tabs.Overall, I'm very happy with this simple upgrade. The attached tabs are the best, there is no way for them to fall off or break off and the hangers are made of pretty sturdy plastic that will last a long time even with an overabundance of tax forms. Its not 6 tiny tabs though, but three generous sized ones.So you could not have six color categories, but if you separate them in sets of three, that works really well for me at home. If you write on the tabs with a sharpie etc. I like the regular tabs that are inserted into slots. These tabs are the same color as the folders, which make them hard to read. The tabs are built in. These tabs are staggered for ease of viewing while in a file drawer; tabs are located atop either the first, middle or last third of the folder. Quarter-length tabs would have allowed for more horizontal visibility while in a drawer, but these have the advantage of a larger writing area. The tabs are 1/3 cut but 20% larger than standard size. The tabs are already on the hanging folder. The tabs are easier to mark.What more can I say about these. Also, if you want the tabs to be in order, you cannot just move the plastic tabs over, you are going to have to move the contents to another folder.But if you are just looking for simple hanging folder holders, these are probably what you want. Ever been annoyed with those little plastic tabs that you slip into the notches on your hanging folders? No more plastic tabs. You can write directly on the tabs, which I recommend doing in pencil so you can erase and reuse them as necessary. The tabs do come in an assortment of 3 positions, so it's easy enough to simply stagger them. But somehow I thought that the tabs were made with material that would allow me to re-use them over and over again. These are so beautiful to look at, and the built-in tabs makes the files look so much more organized. The built in tabs across the top are awesome---i'm getting rid of all the ones that i have that have removable tabs--those always fall.This expands 3.5 inches so it old quite a bit. The tabs are large and easy to write on, but do not stick up too high to close the filing cabinet.The biggest issue with these is cost.T
