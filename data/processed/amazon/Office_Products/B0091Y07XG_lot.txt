Again, this isn't a lot of storage, but this printer is small enough to sit right at your workspace. It will eat up a lot of ink, so try to use a design with lots of white background estate to avoid this. I like this a lot. I print out a lot of projects for my kids, and really speeds things along. I paid a lot more for ink probably a decade ago than this printer is costing. And, more importantly, it does it all seamlessly, without my having to spend a lot of time getting it set up.Here are what I think are the top reasons to consider this printer over some of the other options (and see the end of this review for a note on the fax functionality...especially if you are a VoIP user):1) It was easy to set up:  Though the software-recommended "simple" approach was to use a USB cable, I went with the Wi-Fi route, which worked quickly and flawlessly. I make a lot of itunes cd's for my car and I can now skip using the old sharpie pen to label the disc.Overall this printer is a great machine with many to most of the bells and whistles that you can get in an all in one of this smaller size. If you print a lot of photos, it is nice to have the dedicated photo paper tray, but it leaves the regular paper tray with less room to hold paper.

Apparently there are a lot of moving parts that have to be secured to ship this item.

We spent a lot of time and hazarded on to the solution more by accident than design.

She prints a lot of photos and stuff from Pinterest and was often tying up my printer when I was trying to get some work done.
