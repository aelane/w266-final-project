After receiving an OUTRAGEOUS cable bill from Time Warner and knowing that prices were only going up, I decided to look at my "money saving bundle" (she says in a sarcastic voice) to see where I could cut down. I've almost cut that cable bill in half and that rocks!5 stars for Ooma. The cable company would not allow me to swap my modem until I returned the telephone modem. We don't pay for cable TV presently as it is wrapped in our monthly mobile home park rent. I found we can have 12Mbs cable internet for $34/mo for two years. First, got $30/month cable broadband only (will go up to $46 after intro period). cable connection. The new cable broadband will cost $46 eventually, and Ooma passes on some fees and taxes on the order of $3.50, so I'll be paying about $20 less a month for faster internet (that's the cable guys) and better quality phone connections with unlimited US local and long distance. Ooma recommends installing it after your cable modem (or other internet gateway) but before your router, for best performance. I have a cable company's digital phone service and the OOMA sounds exactly the same. Gee, I paid $125... Fortunately, I had an old cable lying around and used that, although it is not as long as the one that came with the telo.

This is identical to what cable providers (such as Comcast, ATT Uverse, etc) offer in their TV/internet/phone packages.

These cable providers also dump your phone calls onto the internet and then charge you $40 or $50 a month for just the telephone portion of your service.

I also suspect that cable companies have similar caps but I have not researched this.I would NOT RECOMMEND the OOMA HD2 handset.
