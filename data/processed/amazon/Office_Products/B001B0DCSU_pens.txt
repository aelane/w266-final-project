These are, by far, my favorite pens. These are really decent pens for the price! It is not goopy as some pens can become at times. We go back to these pens time after time, because they work! These pens, at least the few I have tried, are as good as the G2s, if not better. These are absolutely the best pens I've ever used. I have bought these pens for some time. These pens are great. I love these pens so much. These are nice pens with good ink characteristics and are comfortable to write with.The price for a 12 pack makes them irresistible.Recommended These are my absolute most favorite pens. The pens were expensive and messy; kids were not allowed to play with them.In school we had to complete a series of penmanship books (1" thick with thin pages)for the first three grades. One of the worst pens (very expensive gold)I have ever used was so slick that it was impossible to hold without slipping.

These pens are absolutely the best pens I've ever used and I now use no other pens but these.
