The Scotch Thermal Laminator is a great product if you are looking for a compact laminator to protect your various documents. I like that it doesn't bubble and makes for a clean finished product. The final product was fused perfectly and was clear with no bubbles or loose edges. It is fast and produces a great finished product. I would highly recommend this product. An inexpensive, easy to use product, the laminator is basically just one button and go, it is that easy to use. Thankfully, the product is just what it says it is and works without a hitch. After this, the freshly laminated product comes out in no time. This product is perfect for a small home office for someone who needs to laminate documents, but not that quickly. This product is easy to use (unlike some other, larger laminators I have used in the past), and is a lot nicer than possibly laminating items by hand (which I have also done). I have used this product several times since I have gotten it, and I'm glad to have it.Also note that the laminator itself can get quite hot to the touch, so be careful while you are using it. This Thermal Laminator by Scotch is an excellent product for a home office. This Scotch Thermal Laminator is an amazing product. However, the product is a great value for the money and an extremely useful purchase for people who need to laminate on a regular basis without any complication or hassle. This product us just fine for around the house tasks and occasional use, but don't be fooled into thinking you can do tons and tons of laminations at once with it. The Scotch Thermal Laminator is an incredible product! I will highly recommend this product to others. Its a great product and I'm having fun with it. Being a Scotch product it is nice, because i am sure we will always be able to get the right type of pouches.
