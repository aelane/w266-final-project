The binder has a tabbed elastic keeper strap. The three-ring binder is one-inch. This is a 1", regular, plastic-imitating-leather 3-ring binder with 2 interior pockets that can be kept closed thanks to an elastic closure. First of all, this is a classy looking binder. I was actually more impressed with this binder than I'd expected. All-in-all a nicely designed and good looking binder for everyday office use. When I first took this binder out of the box, I thought it was smaller than I expected for a 3-ring binder and might need special sized paper. I have a binder which contains our budget and it was falling a part. This binder is replacing that one. It's a pretty binder, actually. You can get them in unfolded, but it's difficult--and definitely not more than 2 or 3.So, if you're looking for a classy binder and don't need the pocket space inside, then this is a great binder. This is a really nice binder. )Overall, this binder is a bit pricey for my tastes, but I love the thing! I needed a binder to hold recipes. This binder seems well made (though made of artificial/man made materials). However, this binder is kind of like a model who photographs well, but in the flesh, doesn't really look all that great. It looks like a very posh, professional binder, and it is priced as such, but up close, I could see that it was actually pretty cheaply made in terms of its materials and assembly. This is a nice looking binder - it definitely is more appealing to the eye than the standard white plastic binders that I normally use. The binder clips open and close easily and close completely so papers don't start to come out.Overall this binder is more expensive but it's very elegant, professional and well made. This isn't a binder that I would send to school with my kids but more for young adults in college or for business. I got this because the 3-ring binder I'd been using for a couple years was starting to fall apart. I also like that the new Wilson Jones binder has a stretch cord that keeps the binder from falling open, and that it has a little loop where you can keep a pen. That said, I expect it will outlast my previous binder, and I do like the way it looks and feels. This binder is elegant with a beautiful shade of blue and great texture. When this binder arrived, we instantly noticed a ripple in the front cover. The binder is heavy duty and made of good quality. This binder is not ideal for using sheet protectors, they extend outside of the binder and if you have a pen in the pen holder, it will flap outside as well. Although this binder is made of good quality, I don't think I'll be getting it again. This Wilson Jones binder is covered in simulated leather and of high quality. If you are looking for a good-looking professional binder, buy this one! The binder interior includes two pockets that go slightly less than a third of the way up the cover on either side. It's a very nice, very professional binder, perfect for the office. Wow, I thought, when I first saw the Wilson Jones Cut and Sewn Binder, that binder looks nice. This binder would make a great gift for someone who is graduating from high school and preparing for college. This frees up space.The binder is easy to open and close. The binder walls are thick and have the appearance of sewn leather. I love my navy-blue binder; however, the binder is manufactured in several other muted, antique colors that are attractive, elegant and stylish. This definitely gives the binder an elegant touch; it has the appearance of being very expensive even though it is reasonably priced on Amazon. I simply adore this binder. I can't help but like this binder. This is obviously a nicer 3-ring binder than usual. The binder itself has a padded exterior with an elastic bungee to keep it closed. This binder would be very appropriate as a presentation cover or any other situation where looks are important too. I'm a binder nut, I use them for everything and keep a selection on hand for various home and business needs. This binder is a nice quality binder. This is also a nice binder to use for school or everyday use. This is a wonderful unique binder. In short, a slick business-style binder only marred by the ring-mechanism. The binder also has a loop where you could hang a pen.The look and feel of this binder is good. The elastic around the binder to help secure loose papers also really doesn't do much. This binder looks and feels nice, has a lot of pockets etc, but is so flimsy. I received this binder free in exchange for an honest, unbiased review, and that's what you're getting. If I had paid $20 for this binder, I would be super disappointed (and not just because I have since read all the one-star reviews about the toxic vinyl chemicals it contains). You can flex and bend the entire binder easily with your hand, which I'm not concerned will damage my papers, but I just don't like the feel of it. This is an attractive, lightweight binder, smaller and softer than the one-inch binders I leave on the shelf here at home. The binder comes with a warning label stating that the product contains chemicals known to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm. Having recently reviewed a different Wilson Jones binder and now this one, I think that reputation for quality is a thing of the past.I was quite excited about receiving this binder, as the idea of the &#34;cut and sewn&#34; cover made it sound as though it would be covered with heavy material. The three ring binder apparatus appears to be the same quality you would find in a one dollar binder from the dollar store. My binder had strips of cardboard protruding from each side of the binder rings. (I only use the binder rings, not the folder pockets.) I like this binder quite a bit. I love this binder. For them, I have found that a flexible binder in general will make it farther though the school year. However, the binder has the less desirable round zig zag rings. It is also a bit smaller than a typical binder, do not plan to use this with inserts for example, they stick out over the edge.
