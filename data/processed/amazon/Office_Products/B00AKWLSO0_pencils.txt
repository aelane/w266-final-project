It also sharpens those assorted sized pencils the kids bring home from the Scholastic Book Fairs. 2's and harder leaded pencils. Colored pencils and the softer artist typepencils are better hand sharpened for a couple of reasons. The softer pencils tend to clog the sharpening gears and Ican see that repeated sharpening of softer pencils could be an issue. They eat up pencils, stop working, and make a ton of noise.I am thrilled that this Westcott pencil sharpener is quiet and very easy to use. We use this mainly for #2 pencils, but my kids have been using different-sized coloring pencils (NOT crayons) in here with no problem and I've used a thick shop pencil easily as there are different size adjustment holes. Nice sharp pencils. I like being able to quickly and easily sharpener many pencils in a short period of time. Most of my pencils are standard sized, but a few aren't and I was glad to be able to use the same pencil sharpener for all of them. This has actually kept a few of my pencils from getting eaten up by the sharpener when I became distracted during the sharpening process. But, your drawing pencils will be a breeze to keep sharp using this. I refuse to buy regular pencils because I am constantly bombarded with whining from my three young children that their pencils points are breaking or that the sharpeners (manual or electric) were no longer operational. Mechanical pencils were an easy solution but have become quite expensive.
