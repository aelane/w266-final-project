They can be used to jot down notes, addresses while in the car or work; the small plastic bag is handy for carrying the labels for multipurpose usage. These are like post-it notes with just the sticky part and then a little non-sticky "flap" to make them easy to grab and remove from the pack or what you've stuck them to.They're perfect for doing markups in a book or papers that you either don't want to scribble directly on or need to have a little bit hanging out to see as a marker. They are big enough to write notes on, sticky enough that they won't fall off, compact enough they don't clutter your desk, and the color are pastel so they won't hurt your eyes.I am very pleased with the labels and will likely buy more when we need to purchase them. These are your basic sticky notes. Some sticky notes are just barely sticky enough to hold to the paper, and inevitably end up either lost between pages, shifting around, or falling off completely. They're basically Post-It notes, but the entire back is sticky. I use Post-It notes, and they are fine for some things. Here's what's different about these that I like:1) The 'stickum' is much less strong than P-I notes, but since almost all of the back is sticky (not just the strip along the top) that works fine. otherwise, you might just want some post-it notes. I would use sticky notes to mark important parts in books and comment, to stick to documents as commentary or to-do, or post them in conspicuous spots as reminders.The problem with standard sticky notes is that only a strip of it is sticky and the rest free. Sticky notes where the entire thing back is adhesive would fix this, but then there's no easy way to take the note off the surface.That's where Avery's Removable Label Pad is so perfect. These are all-over sticky, so easier to make continuous notes on.I guess you can see I like these. If I'm making notes, there's not a lot of room to see what I had to say at the very tip, which would probably hang out of a notebook.The packaging didn't offer me any ideas on how to use the labels, so I tried them on manila folders and books. These are small sticky notes that I find work better than square "Post-It"-style notes. Do you ever get annoyed with Post-it notes falling off? This is post-it notes in the shape of labels and with glue all over on the back. i often fold or cut the post-it notes for this purpose. You can also write notes on them if you're using them for tabs in a reference book. I plan to use them for making notes in books (where I don't want to write on the book pages) and tagging pages that I'd like to go back to for future study. What I like about these compared to the sticky notes I usually use is these are a slightly heavier paper stock. Sticky notes were too big and fell off, book tags were too small and I could color code but not label. They stick so much better than Post-Its and don't curl either, so they're great for leaving notes on my computer screen, desk hutch, bathroom mirror, fridge, and just about anywhere else.The packaging is simple and spare.

They are basically thin post-it notes with adhesive along the entire back of the paper, instead of just the top third.What do the labels do well?

)Having both post-it notes and this product, I find that I don't use the labels any more than I would post-it notes, but if I needed to label something that I didn't want to peel/fall off by mistake, then I would use the labels.

I use them to write notes on anything and everything wherever there is a concern that a normal post-it note may be rubbed/bumped/torn off.
