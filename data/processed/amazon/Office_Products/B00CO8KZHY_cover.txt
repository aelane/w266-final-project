The cover is sturdy and durable.It is a useful post-it notes notebook to have. The black cover is durable and can stand a lot of moving around. My cover was black, not red. This is nice to carry around as the cover is rigid enough to allow writing without needing to tuck a book under for support.The size is nice and I can fit a fair amount of information on the paper. The top cover is creased so that you can fold it back and position the note pad so that it is propped up. I love the tri-fold cover I have one like this for my iPad. I work around this by writing with the cover flat, and looping a wide elastic band around the pages just below the perforated "Can't Wait" bottom section. The cover is too thin and flimsy to offer much support.Great idea, but needs some tweaking to be a great product. It's cool that the black cover is folded back to form a slightly inclined stand on the back. POLIAGENDAS POLIBOOK LARGE HARDCOVER &#34;PHONE CALL DESK NOTES&#34; NOTEBOOK (with &#34;smart red cover&#34;) seemed like an awful lot of silly names for what amounts to a hardcover memo pad. While the cover, which is sectioned off at the front so you can fold it into a stand, is a durable cover, I can't understand two things: why is this so elaborate, and, what's with the gradeschool-project pages? The cover does not work well as a stand no matter what ways you fold it (it is pre-scored for ease of folding, but ... ). Very nice To Do Tablet with it's own cover that makes it handy to be carried around and is also large enough not to get lost on your desk. The black cover comes with bendable sections so it can sit up at a slant on the notebook. I don't try using it propped up but I don't imagine the cover will work that way for long with pressure applied. The cover opens at the top of the pad. Study cover. The cover is made into 3 sections so you can use it at an angle if that works good for you. I have the black cover and it's pretty durable. Once the cover is opened and folded correctly (in a triangle shape to have paper sit at an angle) the notepad itself should stay put while being written on. Why not design a sturdier cover that actually holds the elevated position along with offering pad refills? The cover bends in a way that creates a sort of a stand with an incline, so you can always see the list you have made for yourself. It's got a nice cover and is good to have handy on your desk. The back cover is relatively sturdy. Back cover is a pain to use and too flimsy for a stand (at least for heavy writers).3. I bent the cover around to prop it up like the photo but it doesn't hold up very well. The cover is cheap cheap cheap and completely ineffective.OVERALL: I give it an A+ rating as an office accessory and a C+ for personal use. The "smart red cover " is black.
