But what about when you just need one label?The Avery 45280 labels come on a pad similar to Post It notes. There is one label per page. You simply fill out the label, tear it off the pad, and apply it to whatever you are sending. You could always just print one label and save the rest of the page for later, but this is a time-sink and a hassle. You have to reformat the standard label printing matrix every time you need a simple label. The label has a large "To:" area and a smaller space for the "From:" info. The label peels off easily, sticks well to the package or envelope. Turns out the label is centered on a larger piece, so you peel it off from the front not the back, if you follow me. Each label, attached to a backing, tears off the pad easily. It's easy to separate the label from the backing even with arthritic fingers. Also, you don't have to bend the label, as you do with ones that have two pieces of peel-off backing. The label is 3" x 4", and 1/3 that space is reserved for the "from" address, and 2/3 for the "to" address. Each label tears off of a sort of pad easily and will stick just about anywhere you need it to. Also, I failed to put a second label inside the packages, something else I should have done. So is it the label's fault? I use this label to print shipping name for USPS Priority Mail. The label peels off from the backing with the least amount of fuss--simply push backwards on the top edge (the part with the Avery logo and the number 45280), and the sticky label pops right up, ripe for the taking.3. The label itself is thick yet pliable and "ink-friendly." Usually if I write out a label, I just write on the box and be done with it. USPS may not accept this label either. The label is too small in size to put on a package. I don't know if there's too much to say about a label. "From" and "To" are pre-printed on each label. The label size is good because you're able to write large and clearly. This label is great for covering leftover adhesive bits from previous shipping labels and making the to/from shipping addresses stand out. Only a simple "From" and "To" printed on the label with a blue line to separate sections.This is a simple product that fills a need often overlooked by those who ship out a lot of items. I think we all have quickly written out a label, stuck it on then look at it only to notice that we've written something wrong or spelled something wrong. But longer and the label will stick good and pulling it off will pull the backing off the cardboard, etc.-The labels are easy to write on.-If you're not going to use the label for a package, you can cut them in half or 1/4 and use them as a regular label.Try them, I think you'll like them. I wrote on the label and immediately stuck it down and ran my hand across the label and had just a very tiny bit of smearing of the ink. The label is easily removed from the paper to be able to stick it down.

).If you want a label to really stick get an Avery label, and as they say, "Just write, peel and stick."

Each label has its own backer, so you can peel off the label without exposing the adhesive, which is handy if you want to hand a label to someone else to fill out.It could be used for presents also, if you stuck some decorative stickers in the corner, which was a nice use my children found for it this weekend.It would be nice if the cardboard backer had a magnet on it, so it could be stuck to the fridge, or warehouse shelving, or whatever.

Well, this label solves that problem in that it "sticks" over that weak area reinforcing it and providing a stable area to write upon.The 3 inch by 4 inch label is easy to see on a package and the white background with dark black to & from lettering makes is very easy for the post office or your shipper to see the address.All in all, an excellent item to have around for those quick, one time shipping jobs!
