I have three Epson printers in my family (a couple of us are in college and print A LOT): this one (WF-2530), a WF-2540, and a Workforce 845. I do not like back fed printers but this one is ok. I was not sure it was going to be able to perform so well, as some printers that have so many functions seem to have their technology spread so thin that they just don't have the capacity to be stellar at any one thing. This is one of the easiest printers to set up that I've owned. I own two Epson printers and so far so good.5. Still, it is better than most of the other all-in-one printers on the market, and definitely worth its money.Price: BSetup: C+Overall: B- It is always nice that printers can scan things, as this is something we have found to use from time to time. I have owned and set up numerous printers and the installation of my Epson WorkForce WF-2530 was not much different than others that I have used. I love these wireless printers.

I SO will not be recommending Epson printers to even my worst enemy at this point (well, maybe my worst enemy; watching her get confounded by this printer WOULD be pretty entertaining)!In short, when it comes to Epson, if they ALL behave like this, just say no.

I've owned a few printers over the course of time, and this is my second one that offers wireless printing, and an app to allow for remote printing from an equipped device.

If all Epson printers function like this one does, they're just not worth the cost, and the headaches.
