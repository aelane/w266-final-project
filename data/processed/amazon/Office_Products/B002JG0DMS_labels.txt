Love these labels. These labels work great. Using these labels avoids that. I've tried many different Avery labels, and all of them are excellent, high-quality products that are easy to format and a joy to use. These particular labels are no exception, but they are a little unusual... instead of being bleached white, they are a natural Kraft brown color that perfectly matches most corrugated cardboard boxes.Labels this size are best suited for printing internet shipping labels with barcode postage from places like Click-n-Ship, stamps.com, or PayPal Shipping, but the dark color of these particular labels simply doesn't provide enough contrast for the barcodes to be read correctly by the shippers' scanning machines. These labels are nice, thick, and totally opaque. I can't see why we couldn't print our UPS labels directly onto these, unless the barcode scanner would have trouble reading the black on kraft coloring. There is not much to say about labels. Unfortunately, these labels only accomplish the latter. I was attracted to these labels both because they are made with recycled materials because of their brown kraft appearance; regarding the latter, I liked the idea of the label covering up old markings, especially given that I always recycle old packing materials myself.When I tried these labels for the first time, I went Avery's web site to download a template so that I could print out my addresses from a Word file. These labels are wonderful!PROS:--Removable but stick well--Thin and light--Well-madeCONS:--A bit delicate to maneuver--A bit expensiveIn any case, these are great shipping labels! Brown labels that match the boxes. These labels quickly cover up old labels or where old labels have been removed, previously leaving an unsightly mess.I tried these out on a couple of recent shipments and found they works very well. Brown colored labels to cover up pre-existing labels or logos or markings on the box. While some labels are just too small, the two-to-a-page size of these labels is just right to overlay shipping information on your about-to-be-recycled box. These labels allow you to do so neatly on a brown package. They seem to adhere very well.I like that the labels are made from recycled material, although I don't think the backing material is.Personally, I prefer white labels for the address area because they are more readable. These labels are made of a brown heavy stock paper that completely blocks the old label. These labels do exactly what they promise to: they cover over old labels and barcodes on cardboard boxes, making it much easier and more convenient to reuse boxes. The labels are each 8.5x5.5 inches, which is large enough to cover most other labels (like Amazon shipping labels!) I had to smile when I saw these labels for sale. You use these labels to cover up old labels and postage markings on an already used shipping envelope. The labels eliminate the possibility of that and make the package look much more professional. Never realized how convenient the labels are and will purchase more. Here, the standard white labels blend in while these brown labels would stand out.The labels themselves, by the way, work perfectly with either inkjet or laser, and they align well with the standard USPS, PayPal, and eBay mechanisms for generating package mailing labels. Since these cardboard-color labels blend in so well with the box, I find that they are most practical for uses OTHER than printing actual shipping address information (shipping addresses should stand out in white so that the shipper can easily spot the label). Overall these labels can make re-used boxes appear nicer, which can come in handy when want to make the box look nicer, like when sending someone a gift. These are cardboard brown colored labels that you can use to cover up writing and existing labels on boxes. These labels look nice and have a surface texture that is similar to cardboard. Thee labels are great if you simply want to cover-up something on a box. Recycled:  these labels are made from 100% post-consumer content. They cover the old labels so that you can use old boxes and still have that professional look. There are two labels per sheet. Covers the old labels well. Buy these Avery labels if you have used brown boxes and want to cover up existing marks with brown labels. When I started using these labels, they seemed extravagant. I mean, why not just tear off the old labels? I usually piecemeal labels to cover them up in white. These labels are great at covering old labels so that I can reuse the box. These labels do a really good job of allowing you to reuse old boxes. These labels from Avery make reusing the boxes easy and useful. While I did not find it very reasonable to use the labels as the address label itself, I did find they are worthwhile to use as cover. I've used the white labels like these in the past and really liked them so when I saw these brown ones I thought they'd be great for covering up the labels on boxes I want to re-use. There are two labels on each sheet. I used these labels with an HP All-In-One inkjet printer. I have to say that when I printed out on these labels, I was extremely impressed with how sharp and high quality the resulting printout looked.The glue on the labels made me a bit uneasy. I tried the labels to cover up several different markings and old labels on a box and none of them even remotely showed through the brown labels.Personally, I think the labels have a huge drawback. The labels are the same color as most boxes. I'm very happy to now have these brown labels to cover up those spots.The only way I'd use them as shipping labels, however is either to (1) create a graphic border like the one they show on the package to make the label stand out, or (2) use a thick Sharpie marker to write the address. The labels are pretty strong and do a great job at covering up the stuff you don't want visible on the box and I recommend it for that. +5 stars.These labels however are terrible at using to print shipping address, etc on. It's not as nice, but on average I could see using 2-3 labels on most boxes I mail if I was to use these, which would add an extra $0.56-$0.84 to your shipping cost of the box. These Avery labels are terrific. I've used Avery labels for years and I really like them. They are so big that they covered other labels on the boxes I am reusing, which is very convenient.The Avery website is great and very helpful for downloading templates, too.I highly recommend these labels. They come 50 labels per pack (25 pages, two labels per page). These are very nice labels for what they are, a way to reuse an existing box while hiding old labels, barcodes and such. These labels are brown paper labels, with two labels taking up an 8.5 x 11 inch page. They are peel and stick labels designed to cover up logos or previous labels in order to re-use shipping boxes.They peel and stick well enough, and do cover printed logos on the side of boxes nicely. I would not print labels on them, however, because a white label would be far more readable. I still like the Avery labels better and they work in ink jet and laser printers, another plus.If my math is correct, the cost per label is close to 30 cents each. Having these labels make it a total breeze. So I think these are pretty handy.And if you do want to use them as labels, it's very handy that Avery provides templates for label creation, and that these are likely to work fine in your printer. Not so with these labels with TrueBlock Technology! These tan labels efficiently hides even the darkest marks. I also like that these labels are brown, which perfectly match most of Amazon's packaging (which I later reuse for gift giving).These labels don't seem to loose their "stickiness," meaning that I don't have to tape the label down to keep it from coming loose while my packages are in transit.One more benefit... Even without printing on them the labels are great for covering up other barcode labels that you don't want to show and gives the box a cleaner, newer look.It can be a tad difficult for a UPS or Fedex driver to find the printed label since it is brown but they catch on eventually. You're better off looking for off-brand white labels, or printing your labels on standard white paper and using shipping tape to cover the entire label. These labels do seem durable enough. That being said these labels work for us and our use for them. There are two labels per sheet. To me, white labels look fine on carboard boxes, whether it's new or reused. However, if you want brown labels, you'll be more than satisfied with these. These labels worked beautifully in my HP2600n laser-printer.The thing that really pushes Avery labels into the "5 star" category for me is the [...] templates website. It is easy to apply, the labels are easy to make on any PC or Mac and you end up feeling good about saving a few branches. As you would expect from Avery, these labels are good quality, with strong adhesive on a backing that doesn't get caught in your Laser or InkJet printer.What I don't quite understand is the brown color. While Avery continues to come up with more and more specific labels for any and every purpose and occasion, these are nice brown labels that match the typical brown cardboard boxes. There are 2 labels per sheet (25 sheets; 50 labels). As with all Avery labels, it handles standard print-forms and sticks very well on most surfaces. These unique labels also blend right onto cardboard, so your logos, addresses and other printed information appear as if printed right on the box for a neat and professional look. They are thick enough to cover old labels and -- especially if you use the templates ([...]) -- you can create really cool shipping labels that make small-time eBayers like me look fairly professional rather than just too cheap to buy my own boxes!I like them and intend to keep them on hand. What is there to distinguish mailing labels from one another? In evaluating the Avery 5783 labels I considered the following:1. Do the labels feed through the printer without getting jammed or peeling off the backing? Is it easy to use the second or subsequent labels on a sheet (after having used the first)? Do the labels smudge?2. Do the labels adhere properly to the package? Happily, though, the Avery labels do.Printing is easy, and even with my printer, which forces the print sheet through a very sharp 180 degree turn, the labels don't come off the backing paper. Sure, smack one of these labels on it and it looks prettier, but is sending mail a fashion statement these days?? With some labels I have purchased, the label has come off of my brown packaging paper resulting in the post office having to open it up and try to determine where it needs to go. However since there are two labels on each page with this product, you'll have to change PayPal's settings not to print the receipt (on the second label).Knowing how to handle these small issues, these brown labels are great for shipping use, and highly recommended.Pros:+ High quality+ Easy to peel+ Strong adhesive for snapping to the package+ Matching brown color+ 100% recycled paper (the label part)Cons:- Need to switch to thick paper (envelope in my printer) mode-Avery Shipping Labels with Receiptsis a better setup for PayPal These labels certainly live up to the Avery standard:  Perfect "label-size" self-adhesive label blanks for ink-jet and laser printers. Arranged with 2 labels per 8x11 sheet. These Avery labels allow me to do that.There are two labels on each sheet, so each label is about half the size of a letter page.
