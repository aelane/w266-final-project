I'm currently using my pink binder for a loose-leaf textbook in one of my college courses. The pink plastic covering is on the cheap side too. The pink is a pepto-bismal pink - but I really like the color ;-) Really nice pink color, my kid loves it. I do though wish that it could have been a little less vivid in the pink. Not so sure about the Pepto-Bismo pink color, but the product itself is as advertised. This is a VERY pinky pink. I love that it's such a bright, vibrant pink. I ordered the bright pink binder since pink is my favorite color. It is definitely a hot pink or bright pink. The bright pink is a pretty color. (Though close, pink and magenta are not the same color.)
