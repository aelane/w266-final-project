sure, the colorful screen is nice, but when you're printing black and white labels, i don't see a need for one.this would be a 3-star product because it's too fancy, but given how feature-rich it is and the quality of the product, i need to bump it up to a 4-star. The touch screen takes away the zillions of multi touch (Fn + something) to mine functionality. The touch screen is a breeze to use. The touch screen is nice and easy to use. Its touch screen makes it very intuitive, and most people will be able to leverage the most advanced features in no time. This is a touch screen label maker that can be used as a stand-alone tool, or connected via USB 2.0 to either a PC or a MAC for operation using DYMO Label v.8.4 software. The touch screen presents an area in which label content is displayed as it is entered through the keyboard on the unit. The editing screen has tab menus for font selection, inserting imported material (including barcodes) and layout adjustments. The touch screen is very handy for quickly changing fonts and formats.The lettering is very crisp, and comes with a variety of fonts and font sizes - more than I will every need (I am a boring accountant). The touch screen adds a remarkable amount to the ease of use!I have not tried to connect it to my computer though that feature is present. Also, the touch screen is very intuitive. The screen provides WYSIWYG display of your label layout as well as some control via its touch-screen soft buttons. It has a touch screen, which, while nice, has finite use for me. It has no screen or keyboard; it only prints what your computer tells it to.

It works but sometimes the screen does not react the way you want it to and you have to repeat some actions to get it to register the input.
