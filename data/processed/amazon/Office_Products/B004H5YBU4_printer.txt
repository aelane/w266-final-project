This will locate the printer at its new address on the network.A better solution, if your router supports it, is to use DHCP Address Reservation to reserve an IP address for this printer.Happy Printing! This has never happened to me with any other printer and is not happening with my other printers.The only thing I like about this printer is imagining throwing it out of my 3rd floor window onto the hard cement below. I absolutely love this little printer. It installed the printer as if it was a local printer on the computer..I checked on the network and the printer was there and network was installed correctly. So I deleted the printer in the vista printer Que. Then reinstalled it with the printer add function. The printer broadcasts and wifi pcs can pick it up. When the printer went to "sleep" it shut itself off blue web light would go out and printer disappeared from the net.The default timeout was 15 minutes. When the printer prints a very neat powerful printer control and editor program pops up and allows you to print in color or no color. The printer software is amazing and user friendly.

I powered on the printer, enabled WPS (Wifi Protected Setup) on my router (Netgear N600 Wireless Dual Band Gigabit Router WNDR3700), and then pressed the WPS button on the printer's console.

The printer's status can be accessed either via Smart Panel, which displays the amount of toner remaining (in %), etc.

The user manual supplied with the printer is pitiful.
