Well, the paper seems nice, sort of lightweight, so it could mean the difference if forced into using another stamp. The paper has a blue-patterned interior designed to conceal the text on the checks, documents, etc., enclosed in the envelope. The paper is exceptionally weak. The paper is solid and the blue privacy print inside neatly hides the contents. The paper quality of these envelopes is good and I like the security feature. I found the paper weight to be on the light side, but was pleased that there were no tear-off strips to reveal the glue. The paper is of good sturdy quality and is opaque, so your documents won't be anyone else's business. The paper quality is rather basic, but as with most "security" envelopes, there is a blue patterned print inside to prevent seeing and reading through. Because the paper is so thin, if someone tries to open this at all, the flap will rip immediately and you will know that this has been opened or read.Very helpful when you want to send private documents that you want to be sure are not read, or to just keep things in the home you want to keep nosy eyes from seeing.The envelopes have a nice privacy lining in them too. I thought maybe if the paper was a little heavier, it might make a difference, but I'm not sure.So, from now on, when I use a security envelope to send checks (or money - which is something no one should ever really do), I'll use a piece of inexpensive bond paper folded in thirds, then insert the check to ensure the contents of what I'm sending remains opaque and next to impossible to see. This is actually probably why the cheaper mid-weight paper makes more sense than a heavy paper, which would be less prone to tearing under stress.The cool thing about the adhesive is that it is concealed by the envelope itself until you're ready to use it. This is great because you don't end up with those annoying paper strips all over your office if you're doing a big mailing, but you don't have to lick envelopes or worry about high humidity sticking them together before you use them up.An excellent version of the classic security envelope. The paper weight is about the same as a standard envelope but with a better security print. The paper is about average thickness compared to other envelopes, but I haven't had any problem with tearing or damage. The paper is thin, and the blue pattern is too fine, too regular, and with low contrast. The paper has the nice, smooth feel of quality. They use no-see-thru paper, so the contents are not viewable in the light, but also a system for seeing if the envelope has been opened. Excellent paper quality, and ease of handling and sealing make these a very good choice for the office or home. The paper is crisp and thick enough to make you feel secure about what you're sending. But it prevents the additional paper waste of the peel-off adhesives and it closes well without having to lick it.A quality, serviceable envelope. The paper thickness is adequate but not overly thick. After doing this the paper began to rip when I attempted to open it.So! The paper, itself, is not quite as sturdy as the Columbian Mead envelopes, but is adequate for most purposes. They are sturdy (the paper is a nice heavy weight), don't rip easily, and when I moistened one with steam, it didn't just fall apart. I experimented stuffing it with darkly colored paper, held it up to the light and see couldn't see anything that was in side. The paper stock is just th right weight and the security provided on the inside of the envelope provides security for all your private documents. Quality paper too. The paper appears rather thin but with the security imprinting the contents are not revealed. The paper used to a good weight and they are well-constructed. I try and buy as much recycled paper as I can! They seal very securely and are made of fairly thick paper stock. The paper is nice and thick. The paper stock is strong without relying on excessive weight (possible postage savings). The paper stock is good. It is simple and there is no paper strip  to peal off and throw away.I recommend this envelope to anyone, who like me, still uses regular mail to send messages and conduct some business correspondence. Instead of there being a paper strip that you have to peel off and then throw away, these just unfold to reveal the sticky part where the top flap sticks to the bottom. The paper the envelopes are made from seem to be a good thickness...not too thick, not too thin so that they rip too easily.T
