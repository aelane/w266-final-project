This is especially important as so much paper accumulates containing social security numbers, e-mail address, telephone numbers and other data one may want to keep confidential.This isn't really a cross-cut shredder, however. It shreds the paper into strips and then rips the strips into short sections. This one requires that you meticulously feed all paper products into a Fixed angled opening (about 20 degrees) until the electric eye sees it and the blades start to catch; very cumbersome, so don't expect to do any "speed shredding".The unit is also very loud. The paper feed has a cover piece which flips open/closed and there is a control button and four status indicators. paper. The shredded paper seems small enough to provide security against someone reading them. They can still tear apart paper in certain areas versus producing a clean cut, but it does the job.For confidential documents, the micro-cut shredders are the way to go since the strips are significantly smaller, but as long as the text size isn't too small (say, less than size 8 or 10) the cross-cut is fine.The CD shredder is actually a separate cutter system that slices the disc into 3 main sections. It is noisier than my last one, and doesn't hold as much shredded paper. We put in paper, cds and even the old credit cards and everything is shredded to pieces. The paper chute is easier to hit when you approach it under a desk or at an angle. I needed a new paper shredder for months and ended up with a pile a papers next to my old one that stopped working.
