I like writing on the tabs with pencil so I can erase later if I need to. And you can reuse any tabs. I wrote on the tabs in ink, and after dry was able to erase, so they can be reused. Nice big tabs and since the entire divider is made out of the same material, notes can be jotted down on all of it. I was able to write on and erase the tabs with both pencil and ballpoint pen. I've written on the tabs using both instruments and had no issues with smudging or smearing! The tabs are vibrant colors and my Sharpie pen writing showed up clear and smudge free.I LOVE LOVE LOVE The Comfort Touch Binder! I've tried writing on the tabs with pencil as well as a basic ballpoint pen and was easily able to erase and re-write on them with no problem. They are easily reusable (I actually didn't write on the tabs so I COULD reuse them. I like that I can write on the tabs and wipe it off if I need to. It's colorful and the large tabs are great. The tabs add to my obsessive need to be organized. Avery just needs to include a pen that works well with the tabs. They have write-on tabs (love it!) There are 5 tabs in the set with muted colors..gray, blue, green, white, and yellow. The tabs are holding up and its still one of my favorite things to use to take notes with. I don't like pre-defined tabs that you get from planner companies and I don't like using letters or numbers. The tabs are easy to wipe off, thus you can use them multiple times. The tabs are vibrant colors and allow for just about any writing material to show up on the labeling part. You can also write directly on the tabs OR on the middle part. I was able to write on the tabs in pencil & erase well, however I wasn't able to get my ballpoint pen to write on the tabs. The tabs are large enough for most anything you need.After testing the implements I took a deep breath and started erasing them, after all this is their defining moment.Voila!
