Each organizer has three letter-sized spaces, plus an envelope on the front.I divide my over-1000 grit papers into one organizer, and the under-1000 grit into the other. The organizer expands to half an inch, and the file sections can be secured on the long side with a little flap. Each organizer has 3 tabs for separating trip material into whatever format you want and a pocket on the front to keep important documents such as passports or boarding passes or receipts for easy access on a trip. An organizer for students can easily be tucked into a locker or backpack. Before getting this organizer, I usually put the receipts in the drawer of my work table or some drawer in the house where at some point in time, I either forget it or it is lost. I have a larger organizer, but sometimes I want to have just a few of the essentials and this is good for that. The organizer is sealed on one side and the bottom so papers do not escape easily. The organizer is clear so you can easily see all your papers. That's why I like this organizer - my boarding pass, my driver's license/passport, my baggage tags - all fit into the see through pouch that closes. The entire organizer fits into the side compartment of my carry on bag. This organizer has both good and bad design elements, and it may work better for some than others.
