The eraser worked well. The eraser itself can be a bit stubborn to remove the first time, though.The eraser is made of a plastic compound similar to what you'd find in aStaedtler Mars Plastic Eraser - Color: White, and since it's mounted on the pencil, you don't have to worry about it clinging to things when at rest (an issue that has prompted Staedtler to wrap their erasers in a cardboard sleeve). The eraser "crumbs" fairly nicely when in use, bundling up into a neat flake or two rather than shedding all over your desk the way rubber erasers can.When toying with one of the pencils, I retracted the lead and elected to try it on my smartphone to see how it performed as a stylus. The eraser works great. There is very little eraser guck when you're done and it does not smudge the paper. The eraser works, you can actually replace the leads and the clasp is not easily broken.On the downside, the product description says, "BIC Student's Choice pencil has a classic wood case." The eraser actually does the job as intended - with no smears. I think their white eraser is usually superior to a beige one. Since the eraser is WHITE and erases very cleanly, I am very pleased with this item. Then I tried out the eraser. The eraser works just like any other eraser, and the pencil has a nice clip on the side to clip to your pocket or a notebook. These were great... the eraser is standard and the body construction seems durable enough.

The eraser can be removed to refill the leads.

The eraser works well and doesn't smudge the paper.

and yes, they are refillable by removing the eraser which works quite well.
