These sticky notes help with locating important points on the page for later reference... These sticky notes are transparent. These little sticky notes provide a solution. Be aware that the the notes are only lightly glued at the tip of the arrow. Now, she just has to look for the sticky notes instead of flipping through the entire book! These sticky notes are one of the variations of the line of Avery See-Through Sticky Notes; they are shaped like arrows for more targeted use. The notes are made of translucent plastic material and accept pencils, ballpoint pens, roller pens, and felt pens, although roller pens and felt pens may smudge in the first few seconds or so. The notes do stay flat on the page and I can read through them without difficulty. They are wonderful as sticky notes go. These are large, arrow shaped sticky notes (like a post-it), which you can use to mark a place in a book or a document. These bigger than usual see-through sticky notes are nice to have handy when you have to remind yourself of specific tasks, contacts, etc.A great plus being able to write on them and still be able to see through their transparent, yet noticeable bright color, when you need to have them as part of a document.My only complaint is that I wish they were a little more sticky as they don't "grab" and hold as well as I hoped. These little notes allow me to stick a beautiful see through arrow to the page that does not have to be removed - you can read right through it.This allows me to point right to the place to begin reading and if necessary, another place where to end if necessary as well. I am always writing notes to employees with arrows to make it easier for them to see what they need to do. Now these sticky notes will take the place of that. I love these sticky notes. I like the notes. These are basically sticky notes cut into an arrow shape but made of a see-through material. I think these would be handy little notes for certain uses. The notes are sheer, so you can stick it anywhere on the page and still see what's under the note - huge in my book - and since they're larger than most tabs and other arrows, you can write a little note on them- and actually have enough room for a short sentence vs. the standard word or two.I've been using these to mark ideas in design magazines for future house projects (with notes on specific colors or my take on it); to point out things I want for my birthday (with notes on the correct size and the 'where-to-buy' store or site); and to highlight important tasks that come up during meetings as I'm taking notes, without having to make a separate to-do list.The icing on the cake is that Avery participates in the Box Tops for Education program; not the deciding factor of course, but a nice bonus for those with kids (or in my case, nephews). They'd be perfect for brief notes. I left the sticky notes on ink, but very little of it lifted off. The sticky notes are not paper, but a very sheer, light weight plastic; which is good because they last longer than paper. See-through sticky notes? These notes do their job: a huge neon arrow is impossible to miss on a page. These sticky notes are no exception. I also like to take notes, bookmark and highlight. These sticky notes are definitely a good concept. I find this to be annoying -- I just want to write notes on these with whatever pen I'm writing with at the time!Overall, I thought these would be more helpful than they were. I couldn't live without sticky notes helping me to remember things. Great for taking notes. This sticky notes differ from PostIts in two ways: they are transparent, and they are shaped like a broad arrow. As far as sticky notes go, these are a cool shape and color, but the plastic-y feel isn't that big of a selling point for me. These sticky notes let you point to what your words refer to. These sticky notes are unlike any I've used before. Uber-thin sticky notes in canary yellow and hot pink not only point to what you want to highlight, they allow you to read text through them! These sticky notes are so great to have. I applied the notes to laser/xerox printed pages and was able to lift and re-stick without it taking any of the ink with it (not sure how it would work with desk-jet ink). These Avery See-Through Arrow notes are perfect!
