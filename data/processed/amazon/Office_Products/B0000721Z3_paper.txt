This paper does a nice job for the price. I should have known better, this is NOT photo paper. This paper does not jam, and the photos we print look great. Maybe not quite as good as the glossy photo paper from an inkjet, but they look pretty close. This isn't what I was expecting for 'matte' paper. I guess it's O-K but it is simply smooth, heavy white paper. I normally expect photo paper to give vivid bright colors with really sharp edges, but hey what do want for 5 bucks. I have tried the inexpensive paper and the results reflected in the quality of the output. I prefer gloss paper most of the time but if you like Matte go with this. Buy this paper from Amazon.com because it is priced for me. Give this paper a shot.

I had been using mostly the Photo Paper Pro, assuming that the most expensive paper produced the best output.

Best of all, this paper is less than 25% the cost of the Photo Paper Pro on a per sheet basis.

I actually prefer this paper to the glossy especially with the big price differential.
