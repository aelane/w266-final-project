I am using these as both customized return address labels and address correction stickers on my checks (they are the PERFECT size for that). We used these to create return addresses on envelopes we sent out to clients. I design my own return address labels with a family portrait on them, I print out address labels for my holiday cards, and I print larger labels for packages, all with ease! I ordered these to use as return address labels until my printed ones arrive, but I'm half tempted to not order any more preprinted ones after using these labels! Not much else to say about a return label. These return address labels are great and really helped me out this Christmas when I had to send out all my Christmas cards. Unlike other return address labels, these Avery labels have an innovative "easy peel" feature that lets you fold back the perforation and remove the printed labels by just grabbing the exposed edge. I absolutely love that they make these return address labels so densely-packed and easy to peel. I can design my own return address label, use MS Word with an Avery template to print them out on my Inkjet printer, and have a whole sheet (or more) of them ready to use whenever I need them. You don't need to use them as return address labels at all... These Avery return address labels are your normal, cute size labels. However they were perfect for making standard return labels with plenty of room for my address and a small logo. The typical return address is three to four lines.
