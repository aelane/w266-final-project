This is a great product that will help keep your paper shredder gunk free and working great for a long time. I would recommend this product to anyone that is concerned about keeping their paper shredder working at its best. Good product, good company... As far as the product goes, it works great. Great product at a reasonable price. Very good product. This product is great and works as advertised. I couldn't even find this product in local office supply stores. Got the product very fast too, thanks to my Prime Membership This product comes in a large bottle (suitable for an office environment) with a spout that can be cut so that just the right amount comes out.

I was quite pleased to find this product available from Amazon at a good price and larger bottle.I think a lot of people buy a shredder, not knowing that it does need some maintenance to keep it in top shape.

It turns out that the product is mostly vegetable oil and the worse that I would have to watch for is diarrhea in my cat.The product works really well but it is a danger to pets because of the oil's sweet scent.

I just don't believe a product should be given a poor rating because of the price.
