I actually didn't need to replace an existing phone, but I really like this better than what we had. I put the main phone at an existing jack and put the second base unit in his room. A good phone, clear sound, easy to set up and use,decent range.Works well with VOIP lines, good value for the money.Minus : V tech does not have a friendly warranty policy. I'm fed up with them, and I'm going back to a corded phone. This phone is just okay. This phone was purchased in combination with my voip setup with the OBi100 device. It does have speakerphone on the phone, but as with any cordless phones, you will not be able to talk a long time without the battery running out on you. The in phone settings will be a little complicated for grandparents to setup, but for more average techies out there, this is not an issue. This phone did not have an answering machine but I decided to keep it. The phone is very good for the price.

We don't use the 'home' phone much but need to have one.

This is an OK phone that does its job, but it is not as feature-filled as, nor does is have the sound clarity of, its comparable competitor from Panasonic.

I wanted to put a phone in my son's room, but there was no phone jack.
