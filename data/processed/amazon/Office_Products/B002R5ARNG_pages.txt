The first two pages show kids how to form upper and lower case letters correctly. The pages are sturdy and lined. Most of the pages could be done in a minute or two. Eventually, the pages are gear towards writing actual sentences and only the last 3 pages are actual creative writing prompts.It is attempting to build the foundations for creative writing rather than use prompts to write short stories.So even though it wasn't what I was expecting, I see where they are going with this and I think it would be a great tool for an early writer. I photo copy the pages so that I can reuse the book over and over again. It only had 2 pages for that - one for CAPITAL LETTERS, and one for lower case letters. However, I photocopied those pages so my two kids ages, 6 and 8 would have plenty of them to use. You may want to copy pages of this if you need to use the same page more than once. Also the pages are sturdy enough for young kids!I don't have any complaints/negative points for this book. The last pages of this book contain a Certificate of Congratulations and brief word lists.The pages go by increments helpful in learning how to start writing a story. They are only about 30 pages to the workbook; so not overwhelming at all, yet very educational. All pages have lines to guide their little hands how to properly write both capital and lower case letters. In the first few pages, the letters are shown with arrows and numbers as a guide how to recreate them faithfully along the lines. Each pages are printed in attractive colors, on thick and sturdy paper.The main strength of the book is to help the kids how to stimulate their minds for ideas. After the first few pages, all the pages begin to sort of look the same. There are 12 pages where kindergarteners will like writing six different words that fit situations (items in your classroom, things on a playground, words that describe a butterfly, etc.). There are four pages of this activity.Then there is a 3-story cut and paste section that teaches about action sequence (i.e. There are pages and pages of ideas to stimulate the idea flow, but it's not something that a first grader can sit down and knock out in a day. She did several pages in a row of her own accord with the help of her older sister. The pages following have spaces to fill in what happened. The first two pages were practice for writing upper and lowercase letters, which I thought was unnecessary, as well as a tiny sight word list in the back.My son learned more adjectives with these writing prompts, but I think I will stick to workbooks likeSpectrum Beginning Writing (Little Critter series)for our homeschool needs.This is Stage 3 (creative writing), part of a writing program that includes:Mead Early Learning - Stage 1, Set of Three Stage 1 Workbooks (52511)Mead Early Learning - Stage 2, Set of Four Stage 2 Workbooks (52513)Mead Early Learning - Stage 3, Set of Three Stage 3 Workbooks (52515)Mead Early Learning - Stage 4, Set of Three Stage 4 Workbooks (52517)
