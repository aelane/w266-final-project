The tape is thick enough to hold the hardbook cover on but flexibale enough to give new life to the book.This tape is very different then slapping typical clear shippingtape on a book which is too thin. With Book tape the book isbasicly repaired to like new condition. While this tape is a tiny bit thicker than the standard Scotch packaging tape, I can't see that it is really worth the higher price. The tape rips easily, so trying to make precision cuts with a normal pair of scissors was basically impossible for me to do without the tape simply ripping the whole way across. It is a bit hard to tell this tape from regular packaging tape. It did seem that once I cut the tape as instructed for my paperback, (in a "T" shape along the spine), it seemed to rip too easily when I tried to fit it onto the book as instructed. I used some of this tape to seal the two sides and to reinforce the bottom of several file folders to create enclosed pouch files. The tape is very strong and also easy to work with. I had used packing tape to do repairs but eventually the adhesive dried up and the tape fell off. I can envision using this tape to repair other paper products like envelopes, portfolios, cardboard boxes, vinyl record jackets, etc. I used this tape to fix some old paperback books. I found that the tape unwinds easily and sticks well to the books. You must be careful when using this tape as once you place it on the surface - it sticks.As shown in the picture of the product, this is just tape - it doesn't include a dispenser which can make it difficult to use at times (it can easily stick to itself, making it difficult to find the start of the tape). I used this tape to cover the spines of several different paperbacks, all of different thicknesses. While I really liked the tape, I just could not get the T-Cut and foldover to work. The tape doesn't yellow, crack or lose its glue over the years and when a book is stored. It is nice, thick, very smooth, and seemingly durable tape that is easy to unwind and use. Sure, this tape will do everything the small illustrations on the package show (which are apparently for people who never figured out how to use tape...). However, this tape is not any different from the same tape you can get for less in a generic form anywhere. Whenever this happens, standard tape might not be the best repair choice. This is a tape designed to not yellow as it ages. I just finished using this tape to protect my treasure. This tape helps with the books my daughter carries everywhere with her. After putting this tape on them i no longer worry. This tape is also very easy to use. It's crumbling but this tape helps repair the spine. )This tape is very good for any book that is somewhat ephemeral that you want to keep. She has been using regular tape to try to repair the covers for years, but as soon as she puts the tape on, it tears again. She tried this tape and loved the thickness of it! The tape is thick and sticks well, however it isn't so sticky that it peels skin off your fingers as you apply it. The tape is nice & thick and was easy to use without the problem of air bubbles. It's a clear tape that is similar (if not the same) width as clear packing tape and it also seems to be equally as thick. It's wide, shiny clear tape - that's it.Unless this product was priced significantly less than regular packing tape, I'd probably pass on this. We used the tape to save torn pages from our children's books. The tape is excellent for repairing, reinforcing and protecting books, edges and surfaces. The tape is not forgiving, but works very well once you have it on. This tape is WONDERFUL because it is thick, easy to cut and stays stuck. This is a nice, thick, wide tape. However, it is not particularly sticky, and doesn't seem very different from thick packing tape. This tape is strong and durable. The tape is made to last. The tape itself is clear and glossy. This is great tape. Very thick and sturdy, much more so than regular tape, and certainly superior to the sort of thin tape used in everyday office tasks. I'll admit that I was initially skeptical -- tape is tape, right? -- but this tape really does get the job done. this is tape meant for repairing books. I use this tape just like I use regular Scotch tape to mail packages. I find the tape useful for a number of purposes. There is much wider tape to use with very thick books, like 1,000 page novels. I decided to try this Scotch Book Tape and see how it worked.I was not happy at first to see that the tape was two inches wide. I was able to place the tape on a page or spine and then move it a bit before I pressed down on it and got a firm seal.I also like the fact that this tape is transparent. This tape works for my projects. Sadly, the best tape I could find was regular thick packing tape. This is some great heavy-duty tape that I know won't ruin the books cover. I have to say that it is so great that I almost want to use it as packing tape. I never knew binding tape was available to anyone but librarians! It's time-intensive and not pleasant, and the tape is not a guaranteed permanent solution. This tape, while similar in appearance, doesn't have residue on it, and it's also declared by Scotch to be "permanent. I wrap the tape around starting with the front cover, rather than trying to center the spine and putting the tape on the spine first. Having the tape centered doesn't matter as much to me as ease of applying the tape and getting the results right the first time to avoid further book damage. I have used this tape on some very old hardcover, cloth-bound, 3 ring cookbooks that were literally falling apart and it worked beautifully.I also used it on some old paperback cookbooks and other books that are very old. This tape is almost identical to standard Scotch packaging tape, except that this book tape seems slightly thicker and perhaps easier to reposition. Instead I use Scotch Magic Mending tape for repairing tears in individual pages. This tape did a good job on a couple of ripped paperback covers, and it didn't have sticky edges.
