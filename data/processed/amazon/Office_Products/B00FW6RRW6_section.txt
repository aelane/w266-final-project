In the To Buy section is where we write what we are out of or close to running out of for the biweekly trips to replenish items.The magnetic strip that holds it to the fridge was pretty strong and I never had a problem with it falling off when the doors were opened or shut.Overall, this is a great item to add to your command center at home, or even for a locker at school for kids to just write random reminders on for homework. If you need to separate a section it pulls apart cleanly as long as you fold it over first. Each section has five lines on it which is usually fine for a to-do list and a list of things to remember. Each section can be torn off to remove when tasks are finished or to take along with you. Each section is perforated which I actually like as sometimes we split up the lists when running errands. It has a To Do, To Remember, To Buy pre-printed section...it's an OK Notepad. Either that, or make the section smaller. I mean, does it need its own section? You can&#8217;t remove the top section without removing the entire sheet, which can be a problem if you only wanted the top section. Each section has perforations so each section can be individually removed.The two things I like about this are the size of the three inch lines and how well it holds to a metal surface. Each section is marked with either To Do, To Remember or To Buy. Or each section could've had check-mark boxes next to each of the 3 headers, To Do, To Remember & To Buy. Also the section is so small once tore off of the pad that if you throw it into your purse, it may be hard to locate when you want it.Overall this pad isn't bad, it just could've been designed better.
