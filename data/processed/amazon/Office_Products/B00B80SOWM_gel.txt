And the gel ink seems to be well-formulated.Now, my question is: is there any practical reason to own this many pens? But, and this may be true of all gel pens, you do have to wait for the ink to dry or it smears. I really like a gel pen. The gel pens do take a little longer to dry but they are to be water resistant. 44 gel pens! If you are familiar with gel pens, then you know that sometimes they require a long drying period. I'm currently using these gel pens for card making. The straight gel colors all seem to flow smoothly for me, and they also provide the finer line that I'm partial to.Overall, I really love these pens. The gel does take some time to dry and the instructions warn that the gel is water resistant and therefore will stain.I am like a kid with a new box of crayons :) These gel pens are very bright, and the stand is wonderful for seeing which ones to pick. These gel pens are nothing like those. I usually like gel pens because I have awful handwriting, and the easy, smooth feel of using a gel pen helps me write better. Although gel pens went out of style for me many years ago, this stadium-filled blast of color is just too adorable not to love.
