Also, the white board works great and serves as a reminder of upcoming appointments and meetings.The marker that it came with doesn't last long and I prefer markers that are more bold. I bought a white board for my kitchen downstairs and was completely disappointed when I learned it was not magnetic after hanging it on my door. Prior to my kitchen white board experience, I thought white boards were all magnetic, but sadly found out this was not true.It doesn't look like the most expensive or high class marker board, but it serves its purpose and does exactly what it is intended to do - Keep me organized! This is a great board and even though there is a bend in the magnetic portion, it still works. The dry-erase board is a true white and erases cleanly. The board comes with one good quality black dry erase marker that has a felt eraser and a magnet on its lid, allowing it to be attached anywhere on the dry-erase side of the board, or it can be attached using the clip at the top of the board. This is a nice board that serves its purpose. The board measures 17&#34; x 23&#34; or 43 cm x 58.5 cm, and can be hung using a landscape or horizontal mounting.To install, break apart adhesive tabs into individual pieces. I really don't want to place a cheap appearing board on the wall which will cause damage when I choose to remove it.Otherwise, the Quartet magnetic combination cork and dry-erase board performs well and accomplishes it's intended task. This bulletin board dry-erase combo I've placed right near the phone and my computer, leaning against a shelf. The board is a nice larger size - 17&#34; x 23&#34;. The board is easy to hang and use.
