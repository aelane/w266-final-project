That magnet is STRONG and keeps the pen holder in place even though the holder is made of metal mesh which is much heavier than plastic.The magnet on the ACCO brand pen cup is weak and slides easily even when empty. It has a large magnet on the back so it doesn't slide even when the cup is filled with markers, pens, and scissors. The magnet on the back works well and keeps it in place on the fridge. However the magnet isn't as strong as one would expect from something that size. I don&#8217;t know if the magnet would affect the drives, but I avoid the risk by keeping it on the other side of the monitor. It is shorter than I pictured it, but the magnet on the back is stronger than I thought it would be. The magnet covers almost the entire back of the pen holder. The magnet reminds me of the kind that businesses give out with business cards glued to them. The magnet is strong, so it doesn't slip around. The magnet is not as strong as the one on a similar cup that I've had for years, but it does the job. The magnet runs all along the back side of the cup. You would think with a relatively large magnet back there that it would attach strongly to any metallic surface, but unfortunately, that is not the case. Quartet Magnetic Pencil/Pen Cup Holder has a strong enough magnet that it sticks well to metal surfaces. It is cheaply made, the magnet was crooked on the back of the cup, and it is not a very strong magnet. It's a fairly weak magnet hence having such a sizable pencil/pen holder basically defeats the purpose since it won't firmly stay put on your door or other metal object.Although it's sizable in depth, the narrow width (less than 3&#34;) prevents you from storing standard post-it notes or index cards to write down messages unless you bend them.It's made of a glossy white plastic and none of the edges are sharp. I believe it would have been designed better had it been at least 3&#34; wide and included a stronger magnet so it stayed securely in place. The magnet seems sufficient for what's required, I'm happy with this purchase. Nice, strong magnet mount (be sure you have magnetic dry erase board). It has a strong magnet and is available in additional colors. The magnet is strong enough to hold the markers and a few pens without sliding down the refrigerator. There is a large flat black magnet on the back. The magnet is not the strongest, so you can't put anything really heavy on it, but is handy for the lite stuff. The magnet is incredibly strong. But it feels very sturdy and I was delighted to see the magnet in the back covers the entire back - it's not some rinky-dink tiny thing where any time you put something in it the whole thing starts to slide down - it's on there tight and it's not budging!
