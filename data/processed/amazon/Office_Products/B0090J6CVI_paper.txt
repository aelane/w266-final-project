You can rearrange the paper and dividers in any way that you would like. but the paper slips out of the non-tear holders too easy and I have them everywhere. I love good paper, I'm picky about my pens... you get the idea. And I can buy more lined paper, graph paper, and Ampad sticky notes for this notebook on Amazon. The paper is good quality with light gray lines and spaces at the top to enter the date. I notice Amazon also graph paper and task pads for this notebook.I've been trying to decide how to use mine. The graph paper would be nice for garden design or other projects.This notebook nicely fills a niche between small spiral notebooks, which offer no ability to customize or reorganize the contents, and bulky loose leaf binders. It appears the paper and the post-it-style items would be easy to purchase and re-fill. This strictly lined paper. The paper seems slightly off-white, like there's a bit of gray to it .. it has a nice smooth surface that takes pencil remarkably well. The paper is lined so it is easy to use, and there is even a place at the top of each page for the date. The paper "grabs" them and hugs them. Also the paper is lined and has perforationsto make it easy to neatly remove them if you need to discard one or give a note to someone. The paper itself is made up of a very sturdy stock, perforated for convenience, which I love, and is wide ruled. Also since they are solid and the paper, folders and pockets are what snaps on & off, there is none of that dreaded gap that always seems to happen with regular binders-everything is refillable and very easy to move around/personalize how you wantCons:-none I've been able to find!My 15 year old son immediately claimed this as his own, he said it is the perfect size to use as a planner/organizer for school. The paper is perforated and of decent quality.Who could use this product? The paper is a good quality and if I had to suggest one change, it would be that the paper was not as sort of slick. Refill paper costs $6 for 40 sheets, which is rather expensive. The paper refills are only ruled and graph, the task pad are ruled post its, the flags are not that sticky. There is also a graph paper refill, which makes the notebook even more flexible.The paper quality is pretty good. Can't wait for my gridline paper to arrive.ORIGINAL REVIEW:If you are looking for a notebook that can easily adapt itself to your needs and isn't monstrous in size then you've found it. The Versa comes with wide ruled paper which I don't care for.T
