i remember these 4-color pens as a child and thought they were super-cool. this is certainly easier to carry than 4 separate pens and more environmentally conscious to boot. I still use these pens for taking notes and `highlighting" or underlining different parts with different colors. I have never used green pens before from Bic and I felt that the green was a bit too light. Those pens are best suited as novelties for children; this is a pen that an adult can use for actual work applications. The pens are all medium, ball-point tips and write like any Bic medium ball point pen. I used one of these pens in high school some decades ago and sure it had a geek factor, but usefullness of colorcoding your notes, red for really important, green for done or dates comming up, blue for normal writing, and when something required black pen (or blue pen) - well just so happened you had that!One pen worked through highschool because of the size of the refills inside.In college, an engineering major again had similar demands, just more of them. The pens write smoothly and I have no real complaints about it. It really is like getting four pens for about four bucks all pulled together into one good quality, highly useful pen.- It's not overly bulky like you'd expect: I remember these having a much bigger end where the different buttons are for selecting the color you want to use. I collect pens and I'm kind of a snob,I have many pens that are very expensive and I didn't expect much from Bic,but geez! !I have several very pricy multicolored pens that never seem to work very well,but this cool Bic pen worked perfectly right out of the package,each color ink worked perfectly right as pen hit paper.The pen has a comfortable soft grip and for having the four colors in the barrel,the pen is surprisingly slim and not that thick compared to some other multicolor pens I have.Because of the wonderful price of this Bic pen,I can take it out of the house for use and not worry if I was to lose it.It's a great pen and I'll never think of Bic in a bad way again. I've been using the four-color Bic pens on and off for years, and have been usually disappointed at how the ink doesn't flow easily whenever I try to use it. I also need pens of different colors to grade papers and reconcile various accounts, so no more hunting down several pens with contrasting colors. Admittedly pens were not so fancy back in the day as they are today. We have tried so many of these multi-color pens in the past. The pens themselves write very nicely for a $4, 4-color pen, better than I remember with the old version, with smooth, skip-free performance. Remember those multi-color pens many of us grew up with? I am always having to carry multiple pens with different colors and forever losing one of them.In just one pen I can have four colors thus making my life a lot easier. I used to love these pens when I was a kid. I remember the old pens would sometimes be messy, the ink would glob or sometimes you would have to scribble on another piece of paper to get the ink flowing again.

The pens served me well throughout my HS and college years.

No longer will you need to carry around multiple pens.

Multi-colored pens are handy-especially for accountants, designers and other folks who need the ability to mark in multiple ink colors.
