Binds up to 600 pages and reliable every time. It claims it can bind up to 600 pages, but I never tried binding that many pages together. I put 70 pages into the binders I bought SEPERATELY and then proceeded to put the binder on a thickness scale right on the machine that tells you which of 10 setting the machine will use (it auto-senses the thickness when you insert the binder and you try to adjust the settings); you can override the time it takes to bind manually if you need to. Two back pages were loose, but the instructions said to redo if this happens so I did and all pages are now securely in the thermal binder. I gave most of the pages a firm tug. I suggest binding very crisp pages for best results.I am reviewing this product as part of the VINE program. I found no loose pages, and nothing to fix.I believe the machine itself, and the overall binding system, is well designed. The pages are secure. all the pages were secure in the plastic folder.3. It will look better than squeezing pages into a slightly too-narrow cover.OVERALL:Fellowes Thermal Binding Machine gives a crisp, professional binding to your important presentations without the bulk that ring binders require. I've done as little as 5 pages and as much as 50 pages at a time.
