The eraser is actually a good and substantial one. I think you remove the eraser and slide them through the back. The eraser is much larger than the typical mechanical pencil eraser.Overall, these are decent mechanical pencils if you want to have spare pencils around to jot down notes. What's not to like :)The attached eraser is better than nothing, but as I normally use a Staedtler eraser, I was not bothered by its lackluster quality. The eraser is a little hard, but it seems to do the job fine. The eraser does not erase well. I always hated the tiny eraser at the end of mechanical pencils, these pencils give you a nice big one. The eraser does not smudge and the mechanical portion of the pencil worked great as well. The eraser is extra long and almost smudge proof. The eraser works well and does not smudge. It's a large eraser, so I know that it will last for quite some time.Also, the pencil is clearly marked as #2. The humongous eraser is a big hit with my son, too, though it'll be a drag when the eraser is gone, because they don't seem to be refillable.The lead is VERY sturdy compared to other mechanical pencils. The eraser is rather small and probably won't last as long as the pencil (and no replacements are included)2. When you push down on the eraser you advance the lead and when you pull the eraser up and off the pencil you find the compartment where you can insert a stick of new lead.I've been looking around the Amazon site and find that this style (l.7 mm, #2 lead) pencil comes in other packaging and styles. I use LOTS of eraser when working Sudokus and probably need to learn a better method that doesn't need so much erasing. They have an eraser that is about 3 times larger than the average and they have 1.3 mm lead, the size of a #2 pencil. The eraser works well also. You must click down on the eraser and then press gently down on the lead to get it in writing position. The eraser is not very effective, but the kids use the individual erasers anyway. The eraser is quite clean to use (as opposed to others I have used that smudge and make a mess).As stated in the product description the "1.3mm lead allows for less breakage and never needs to be sharpened", however, it is so resistant that it takes a lot of use to make the lead pointy, which may result in uncomfortable writing for some. The eraser seems to work just fine. Once the eraser is done you will have to use a separate one....or switch off to the next pencil in the pack.

The eraser on them is awesome too.

The eraser does erase the lead on plain white paper.

They have a large eraser, that is pretty hard and doesn't work great.
