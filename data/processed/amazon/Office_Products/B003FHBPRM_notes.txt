It's necessary I know, but the notes come out "wrinkled". I want to start this off by saying I LOVE post-it notes. These handy Post-It notes come in an easy to use flexible envelope-like dispenser that sticks to just about any surface. The notes are contained within a protective cardboard case so edges don't get damaged and sheets don't pull off when you don't want them. Regular post-it notes in a dispenser that sticks where you want it to be. Original Post-It notes cost about six dollars per 1,200 sheets. I love these Post-it notes for the laptop!!!!! You can put a few notes where you need them,  But if you carry a laptop case, you can keep an entire pad (note that this only holds about 10 notes at a time, then you have to refill it, which isn't that easy to do). and keep notes within reach! If you want notes always handy, your laptop or a metallic place might be the perfect spot to retrieve them from.There are so many ways to use post-it notes, and this is just another avenue. They are designed to hold 20 3x3 Post-It Pop-up notes. So, if you're used to sticking the notes 'sticky side up', its not really happening. The notes come out wrinkled, which really annoys me. I love Post-it(R) notes and these are no exception, but as I began to think about sticking them on my laptop, I decided that I couldn't think of any particular circumstance where I would use these that a regular thicker stack of these notes wouldn't be more useful. Be sure you to use the accordion-style post-it notes. It is quite convenient to have the notes stuck right behind my computer screen. I was excited about these post-it notes since I use them frequently, but they get icky since they don't have a dispenser. These sticky notes come in a thick paper envelope that stick to almost anything. Great for quick notes and to-do lists. They work great though and I would definitely recommend them if you write little notes a lot, as I do. Now with the Post-It Laptop notes firmly affixed to the lid of the netbook (there isn't any room on the keyboard for it), I just grab a Post-It and jot down what I need. The notes are handy if I need to write a person's license number and now I will not have to scrounge for that ever elusive piece of paper. If you're one to regularly scribble down notes, you'll like these too. Post-it notes are always useful, and these are no exception. I always keep some Post-it notes handy, but since they lay on the desk they tend to get buried under stacks of paper and then I can't find them. The notes are easy to reach, but since they're on the other side of the screen I tend to forget they're there. Again, the notes are easy to reach and they don't disappear under stacks of papers.The dispensers are refillable, but the pads of paper that came with them are about half the amount of pages of a regular Post-it pad. While it says laptop notes dispenser, you can fix it to the top of the overhead bin door in the cubicle, for e.g. I use quite a few of these little notes, and I'm a gadget fanatic. The notes work great for that, and I easily moved the dispenser to my next book.Why only 3 stars? Post-it notes.... what was life before them? I actually took about 20 sticky notes and put it in top of my laptop. These cute little notes are fun and easy to use. I don't know how you improve upon sticky notes, but I think Post-it has done it. I use sticky notes for everything and this makes it even easier. These little notes are pretty cool. I also like that you can refill it yourself, meaning you don't have to buy "special" notes made specifically for this holder, just regular old accordion-style post-it notes. Anywhere you want to keep Post-It notes handy. Sticky notes are a staple to any business and many households. As the notes themselves are packaged in smaller quantities than the normal 3 X 3, they are designed so the laptop can still be securely closed and put away with the dispenser in tact and ready to use when you use your laptop the next time. I am constantly making notes for a screenplay on scraps of paper, napkins, even-toilet paper(!). Well, I've got a laptop and I take notes from time to time, but I don't know why someone would NEED to have post-its stuck on their computer. These sticky notes are light and portable. It is easy to use and the post-it notes pop up without getting stuck. If you use post-it notes, you'll like these.

Now I can get and keep those precious notes used to write down sub assignments and everything on my weekly grocery and drug store lists.

I find that these notes stop me from procrastinating.
