Canon Pixma MG8120 is a reliable printer build on Canon's vast experience with good photo printers.It produces good result prints especially when used with Canon printer paper. I have had this printer for several weeks now putting it through it's paces. This printer can do it all. Overall I can't recommend this printer enough. This is a gorgeous looking printer with a sleek black color and a flip up LED panel with a clear bright display. This is a wonderful printer, but a little pricey and slightly difficult to set up. This printer is a lot of fun. This is a wonderful and easy to use multi-function printer. For now, I am pleased to have my first wireless printer. This is a great printer. Fortunately, I have a HP 895 Cxi printer. If you plan to use it as your main printer keep a good supply of replacement ink cartridges.Update: Oct 2013. Still I can recommend this printer to anyone needing a fast, photo printer. I was absolutely delighted with the printer. Great printer but come on, Canon! Seriously, you release this and then add Apply Air and expect me to buy a new printer a few months later. Otherwise, this is a great printer. After removing this printer form the box, the first thing I thoguht was,"Wow! This printer is friggin' pretty!" Even installing the printer head was a snap.The features on this printer seam almost endless. The printer works quite well, it's fast, and the final product (assuming you're using good quality paper) is excellent.

This is my first wireless printer and the setup for wireless connection was not too difficult, except that my firewall interfered with being able to connect, so had to shut it off temporarily.

You can use the printer with a USB cable if you don't want to set it up for wireless.

This is the first printer that I have had where I had to install the print head myself.
