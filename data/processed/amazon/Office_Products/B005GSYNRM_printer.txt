I liked the printer's small size and compact footprint.HOWEVER, after a little more than a year (and warranty expiration), NX430 died. I have had this printer for about 6 months now and I love it! Getting the printer online was a matter of a few settings for WiFi, then on the PCs and Laptops it was just a matter of running the setup software and it found the printer no problem. This is a very quiet printer[+ Helpful Utility] The Epson print utilities give you all the settings you could want, including advanced color settings (if you're a bit more conscientious about how your colors are printed) and also easy to see ink capacity status. This is a great printer and well recommended. So far, this printer works wonderfully. Now, given that, this printer ROCKS for color and copies.Epson's NX430 takes little footprint space, so an unexpected find was that it sits next to my desk where books once stacked like a growing pile of lost souls; but wifi'd up, this sweety can go anywhere, even remote. The printer had no problem picking up the stiffer paper.I like being able to replace the colors individually, but wish the black was bigger. This printer offers a number of attractive features: you can print directly from your camera's memory card; you can print from your smartphone, although not quite as conveniently as with some HP printers; you can make copies; you can print from another room and eliminate the need for a cable (which adds clutter and additional cost, since it's not included) by connecting this to your computer wirelessly; you can scan photos and documents; and it's not very large. We just got this printer last week and I have been putting it thru the paces. This is my second all-in-one printer, and my first wireless printer. I guess my old printer must be fairly small as well, because this Epson is pretty much the same size. The printer can accommodate paper from 4x6 to 8.5x14.Printing from your computer is easy. The printer will create a new folder on the SD card (EPSCAN) and save the file in there. If you do this from the printer you can automatically print right from the LCD screen. Should have gotten this printer earlier. My Canon printer, though nice, is too big for my desk/office and the Epson is a nice size for what I need. Have not set up the Wireless yet, since the printer is next to my MacMini 2011 and no need to at this time. This printer is such a job and is hooker up wirelessly to our laptops, desktops, ipads. We are very pleased with this printer and all it can do. Reading that this printer would produce 6.2 per minute was a "ho hum" statement to me because I no longer believed those types of claims ---- Until I tried it. With this printer and refilable cartridges I won't spend much time deciding if I need a printed copy or not. I'm using it as a printer, not a football. I'm not writing this printer off quite yet - I plan on trying some other brands of photo paper, but at this point, it is not catching 4x6 photo paper and running it through.Overall, I'm pleased with this printer for regular everyday copying and printing at home. I was very happy with my HP C3180 All-In-One printer. But, since I had my old printer, I could spare it.Printing:  Very easy.T
