It takes a little while longer than you may expect to initialize the scanner, to begin the scan and to create the file on your computer. This is a neat little portable scanner. You could pack the scanner in a bag while traveling and use it in a hotel room.The scanner defaults to 600 dpi quality, and has an option for 300 dpi. You can also run the scanner off of a wall power brick, but, again, Kodak doesn't supply one. So if you want to run the scanner off of AC power, a trip to Radio Shack is inevitable. So how did the scanner do in scanning my photos? It's that the scanner requires them and won't work at all unless you use Ni-MH batteries or plug it in instead. So why do I give the scanner 4 stars? By setting up this scanner, I could literally just feed photos into it and have cropped images appear on the external memory card. This scanner is good enough when it needs to be there and needs to be fast. I have a flatbed scanner and an All-in-1 printer/fax/scanner. Then again, if you frequently have need of a portable scanner you should check it out. I finally broke open this scanner this past weekend to scan some old pics I had from before the days of digital. The scanner will fit in my purse; no need to chug a printer somewhere, or ask them to bring all their pics over to my place.Will definitely be using this device.
