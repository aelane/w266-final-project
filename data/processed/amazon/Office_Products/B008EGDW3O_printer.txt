I was going to give the printer four stars because it does just fine in all other areas. The printer does not appear to have come with photo printing software. But... one can print using the printer control panel and inserting an SD card in the printer's SD card slot. That would force the printer to use its own algorithm to print the picture.I inserted an SD card and from the control panel, gave the instruction to print a photo. :-)This is a great printer all around - especially for the price! Every Epson printer I have owned has been an excellent buy.That having been said, it's to every consumer's advantage to do their homework and find the best printer for their needs. Meanwhile, this little printer is quiet, offers a lot of selections right on the control panel without the necessity of changing the settings via my computer. It prints slowly but so does my larger, more expensive HP printer. They are easy to insert compared to my HP printer. It's also a regular printer and a copy machine!I tried out all three modes and was satisfied with all of them. It is a great all around printer for a good price, and it is extremely easy to set up and start using right away. Like that printer, the XP-400 is very easy to set up the wireless connection. Great printer, recommended. I'm quite happy with this great little printer. This printer is so compact, and very quiet compared with my old Canon all-in-one. If you're looking for a great printer under $100 which is small & compact(lightweight)but can handle your printing needs(as long as you're not burning through ink with tons of copies)this IS the printer for you. Yet I can load up this little printer when I need to take my notebook on the road, and that's convenient for business situations.I have tried many brands of printers over the years and am now an Epson convert. This printer is a very basic model and certainly would be of use to someone who is concerned with a device that has a minimum footprint as far as the space it takes up. And I probably would have gone on doing that, if I hadn't looked at other Amazon Reviews of this printer and the comments on them.What one reviewer said was that the printer didn't come with a USB cable. If I were looking for an all-in-one low-end printer I would definitely steer clear of this one. However, it was indeed the printer. this printer is much like my other epson, except that it;s wireless. Overall I think it is a great printer , I have used it for awhile now & I like It very much, it is a bit smaller in size than my other printer which gives me a little more desk space.I would  highly recomend it. This printer is small, compact, and good for tiny rooms. )I personally recommend if you buy this printer, use it to print photos. I was very surprised how much smaller and lighter this printer is compared to the Canon MX512 I am replacing. This printer is so small and lightweight I can move or locate it anywhere in the house with no effort at all. I own anEpson Artisan 50 Color Inkjet Printer (C11CA45201)printer as well. I use this printer at my business and I love it (I also use a bigger Epson at the home office). This printer was very easy to set up. I am very please with this Epson Home printer, easy to install and to print. This printer sat in its box for about a week, because I'm not particularly good at setting up electronics. I have my Epson printer in a shed outside my house - the shed being my home office. The Epson Expression Home XP-400 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer, Copier, Scanner is a small printer compared to other home-based consumer level printers. Then you set the printer on your desktop, raise the paper support and connect the power cord to the back of the printer and plug it up to an electrical outlet. While I will be the first to say that HP makes a great printer and associated software, the price of ink along with the poorest customer service I have ever encountered made me look for alternatives. The printer was nice and light. If you are looking for a printer that a bit on the higher end and is a bit smarter with better software, then I would stick with HP. ****  *****  ****  ****This printer is a very basic, no frills printer, easy to setup, cheap to maintain. If you need a light-duty printer for home and perhaps student use, this is a good choice. to my printer. No more having my printer take up one of my becoming increasingly more used, limited USB slots. The printer is very lightweight and easy to move if, like me, you are short on space and have to rearrange a lot. This is a fairly basic printer, at least in terms of quality. The printer also kept dropping off the network, where as the first one did not. Again I contacted Epson to see about getting the printer replaced and they shipped a replacement.I honestly believe they sent the original printer back to me because after setup, the print that came out was a huge mess of ink everywhere. I would not recommend this printer to anyone. I totally recommend this printer, you won't regret it for the money! Epson recommends attaching the printer to computer with a USB cable which is not included (deal with it). I installed the printer software from the CD after putting the printer on my network and the printer was found immediately. TheDURABrite printer cartridges(plural - you need four: Black and white, cyan, magenta, yellow) gives better than average photo prints, especially if you use higher quality photo paper. I wasn't sure if I would be happy with this little printer or not. My previous printer was a big fancy Canon with all the bells & whistles. I immediately ordered a Epson printer with all the bells & whistles. This is one amazing printer. It's small, but performs just like a printer of twice the size.Set-up took all of 10 minutes. This printer has a nice square form - it doesn't have a fax or anything fancy on top so it is just like a medium size square box. If you're going to be using this printer a LOT, look at the workforce 645 with its huge slide-in paper tray, because I feel like I'm always putting more paper in this one, or fixing the paper where the cats have attacked it. But I found this printer to be painless to install and a real joy to use.1)  Before we discuss the actual device, I first want to praise the packaging of all things. I'm not going to neg the printer right now just because of a potential fixable technical problem, but if it can't be resolved I will demote it's star rating. The printer accepted this one for some reason. I've gone through the printer's menu about 15 times and I can't figure out what's ailing it. So this smaller, compact sized multi-format printer seemed the perfect thing to put near my workstation, to handle quick scans particularly of photos that require a flatbed and cheap print jobs.Overall, I'm pretty happy with it. I bought this printer specifically for my wife and son so they could print from their iPad Minis and iPhone/iTouch using AirPrint. The printer works great with these devices right out of the box. I really like this printer. It's not the printer's fault - the printer sees my computer's wi-fi, but my computer doesn't acknowledge the existence of the printer at all. I first installed the printer with a USB connection one one workstation and then wirelessly through the network on another. So, this printer didn't impress me in terms of its print quality or print speed. The printer lacks a document-feeder, and it lacks faxing functionality. I went with WPS, and the printer and router immediately "found" one another. It means you can put the printer wherever you want in your home or business, and never need to worry about connecting the printer to your computer. The printer is sleek and easy to setup/use. The printer is average size to a "desk-top" kind of printer and the slanted paper feeder makes it easy to push it to the edge of the desk and against a wall. This is a great little printer. Epson Expression Home XP-400 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer, Copier, Scanner (C11CC07201)I was pleasantly surprised to see that this printer is small and compact. I turned on the printer and installed the ink cartridges and then printed a test page. After leaving the printer on I put the CD in my computer to install drivers and set up the wireless capability. This printer takes four cartridges: black, cyan, magenta and yellow. But instead the printer is just as large as the other all-in-one printers I've bought in the past. But I guess it's small for an Epson printer! Some say this printer feel flimsy, but to me it feels pretty solid and fits the need I have for an economy printer with inexpensive cartridges.Total package  - it's a winner, with great features such as wireless printing, effortless scanning, excellent copying, you cannot go wrong for the price. It should be noted that the printer does not include a fax function. The printer also features an LCD touch screen control panel, and the menu system is easy to use. This is by far one of the least complicated printer models on the market.I did have some trouble with the scanner driver not initially being recognized, however Epson included a wizard which helped me resolve the conflict. What this Epson printer lacks is bulk and footprint, but what isn't missing is performance. It's a humble printer, devoid of some of the features others may offer, such as fax, built in duplexing, or photo quality printing, but it prints well, has inputs for SD cards, and is easy to set up (no need for USB cable). )I can see this being a great printer for my small office. I haven't used the printer an excessive amount. This is a pretty awesome printer for the money ($70 at the time of writing). I got this printer for my daughter to take to college and so far it seems great. This Epson Expression Home XP-400 printer is great if you have a lack of space for a huge printer. I've been using this printer for several off-site group meetings, and it had been great so far. However if you need a dedicated printer, print a lot, and you can buy a larger one, make your initial investment at a higher class one, and you can save on ink costs in the long run. Epson suggests having a USB printer cable (NOT included) available for printer setup, even if you will be using this printer wirelessly. When it asks, select "this printer is already connected to my wireless network" and continue with the installation. I purchased this printer for a friend of mine to replace his older Epson MFP. I can not really fault the printer for this, but think that others might want to know about this issue prior to purchasing. Epson's basically told me I could have the printer repaired (at more then it cost), or buy a new one from them. This is the first printer I've had that is what I've always thought a simple compact all-in-one should be.
