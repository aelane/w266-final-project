I really liked the design of the box; it reminded me of simple origami:1. This is an interesting design and it works quite well if:1) you can follow the ridiculously difficult pictures to understand directions on the bottom of the box. It is slightly less durable than the older design (other brand). The new Fellowes design does away with a hefty chunk of that stop-and-start action with the introduction of a new, scallop-shaped fan-type box bottom that unfolds and settles into place *_as you open the box into its rectangular shape_* Yes, that's right: the box assembles its own bottom section, without you having to do anything to start it, other than opening up the sides of the box and popping out a few tabs on the top. I would certainly recommend this design to anyone with a prospective move, be it large or small. The design is great for long-term storage or for moving items. A really amazing design!!! Way better design (no tape needed) and much more sturdy than Uhaul boxes. The design is ingenious and efficient in use of material, nothing is wasted. They're easy to assemble (very intuitive design), are very sturdy and stackable, and are made from recycled materials. I really like this creative and sensible design since it does not require tape. It comes in tape-free design, but the closing tab is not designed well. I loved this design!!

The Moving Boxes, however, have an innovative design which folds the top down upon itself, locking it tight, (providing even more cushioning for the hand holes), making it very unlikely the top would fly off in the wind.3) Re-use: Are you one of those people who like to take apart boxes after a move, compress them flat, and use them later on?

The design of the box lid is such that a sort of cushion is added to the tops of the two hand holes.

The design works too: more comfort when carrying a heavy box.This innovative design does have a cost though.
