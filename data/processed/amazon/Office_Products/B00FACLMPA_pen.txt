Even the red pen flows easily, as is not often the case. The pen feels also little heavy too me. So this pen might be fine for people with average hands.I have a pet peeve about putting a red pen in the batch too. Will be using this pen for my word find puzzles. I appreciate having a retractable pen rather than one with a removable cap that is easily lost. I can say honestly, a great pen at a good price. You can tell you did not write with a regular pen, it does not match. SO the pen writes smoothly with no gumminess and the ink dries fast enough that your hand doesn't smear it accidentally.A few notches above the junky pens we get at work and the freebies you can pick up at businesses, but not (duhhh) like a fancy writing instrument. This may please some who favor such a pen for extended writing, But despite the rubberized grip, the pen did not have the heft I am used to, if admittedly from using fountain pens often as well as conventional ballpoints and rollers to write these days. I like the pen's feel and the writing is clean and smooth. I've always thought that the G2s are really smooth, but after writing with this pen, the G2 felt a bit scratchy.The ink is richer and more vibrant than ball point pen, but it is not as even as a G2. If you want an inexpensive pen that does (translate : not a Space Pen), try the Uni-Ball Power Tank RT. At about $3.00 per pen, it's a pretty good deal. I found a new favorite pen.
