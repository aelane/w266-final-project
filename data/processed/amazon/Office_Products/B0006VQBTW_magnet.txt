The magnet seems kind of wasted as the weight, or maybe the odd shape, makes the markers fall off the fridge. With that being said, the magnet isn't quite strong enough to keep the markers held horizontally on the magnetic surface, as it's suggested you do, to keep all the ink in the marker from draining out of the felt tip. Not only does it have a magnet on the side, but the lids have an eraser at the top for quick and handy erasing! The magnet is in the cap. The magnet feature makes it theoretically attractive for teachers, but it is not particularly strong and the ink insufficient to make these practical. I discovered, however, that they need to be stored point down (sticking up from the magnet) or else the markers will seem to be dry when you go to use them. The magnet on the markers isn't the strongest  as I've had a marker take a dive when the fridge door close a little hard. The magnet allows for ease of use right away, just be careful not to slam a door a little too hard!The ultra-fine tip makes these ideal for use on smaller surfaces (such as a dry erase calender) and gives you greater detail in your writing. Unfortunately, the magnet on one of the markers fell off by the second day, and the felt erasers pop in and out of the lids too easily. I like them having a magnet that hangs right on my white board and the eraser in the cap, but I wish that the ink was actually the bright color of the cap and not a very pale shade. They're super-convenient with the attached magnet to hold the marker on the board and the mini-eraser. I like the built-in magnet that holds the pen to the whiteboard, but that's about the only thing I liked. The magnet on the lid is a nice idea but it is not strong enough to be secure, my markers slid down the board slowly. They also have a built in magnet for sticking to your metal board, or any metal surface, so they don't get lost easily. The magnet on the side makes them extra-handy.
