So that's awesome and I'm really pleased with that.The pens themselves are pretty great. I wish there were a few more black pens (I only got 6) and fewer brown pens (I have at least 10+ of those), but I guess I can't complain. When you're finished using your pens, unnest the pieces of the case, pop the lid back on and lock it, and off you go. !The pens write very smoothly and all of the colors show up well on the page...even the yellow and light peach colors. I find this true of any pens...I don't consider it a flaw of these specific pens.My only complaint is that once you take a few pens out of the container, it is somewhat difficult to get them back in. ...it is really important to remember that about the pens especially when you figure that many of them may not be used right away. Both Sakura and TEKwriter brag their pens are archival with check-safe ink. A tie.Archival check-safe:All pens were essentially water proof after drying. All pens were also resistant to alcohol if it was just poured over the ink. 100 pens?! I love these pens! The pens write very smoothly and the colors on the page are vibrant.The case is not perfect, but is still pretty cool. I didn't expect these pens to write as smooth as the ones I'm used to, but was pleasantly surprised. I came across a few that weren't as smooth, however they still wrote better than some other pens I've used and they were the more fluorescent colors (lime green, pink, etc., so not commonly used for writing).Lately I have been almost always using a uni-ball 207 retractable medium point gel pen. While I still love the uni-ball pens the most, these TEKwriterUSA pens are almost as great -- the main differences between them are the grip and thickness of the pens (in my opinion, the uni-ball pens do flow a little smoother, though maybe they feel that way because of the comfortable grip). Gel pens do not work the same way, so licking the end or flicking flames is a good way to ruin your pen. I especially love pens. The pens include glitter and neon varieties, pastels, bold colors, as well as a few traditional blue and black (but just a few- I think I counted six, total). The pens feel good in my hand, and the ink flow is good. I find putting the pens back in the organizer very easy while I do have a bit of a challenge replacing the cover as the clips don't click in as easily as I would like. Most of the pens have tips thicker the G2 0.7mm I own. These pens offer all the color diversity you might want, while coming in varying widths. 100 pens, all in color order.Can't beat the value - for about $0.41 per pen, you'd pay up to $2 each or more for individual pens at office supply shops.A great deal, and a lot of fun! Thankfully, since you have to look at the pens from the top to see which ones you want, they're coded on the cap:* Glitter pens have glitter embedded in that part of the cap. * Metallic pens have a metallic sheen to the plastic color-coded cap. This one looks sharper, but it's harder to put the pens back in--it's not intuitive as to where they fit. The pens flow nicely and are of great quality. I prefer gripless pens or those with grips close to the base because they afford me greater line control while writing without discomfort. Are these pens an absolute waste or horrible investment? That said, these pens can only do so much. The pens write smoothly. I haven't had the pens long enough to know if the colors will fade over time (hence, four stars rather than five), but the description says they're archival quality, which is reassuring (though I don't know this brand). The pens are more or less grouped by color in the case, and the pen caps reflect the type of pen. Some of the pens do seem to be repeats, although they sometimes have different tip sizes in the same color, so I'm not sure whether there actually are 100 different colors in this set. Unfortunately, the pens are not marked in terms of color or tip size.The pens write smoothly, even on first use. I tried the pens on a variety of paper, including typical copy paper and a Field Notes notebook. The pens did not seem to bleed through. The pens themselves are of average quality -- hard plastic barrels with snap on lids. The pens do pop up when the cover is inserted into the bottom, which creates a carousel of sorts. TEKwriterUSA Gelwriter Gel Pen Set with Pop-up Case are really great pens for artwork! I can't stop playing with these pens with watercolors.Most of the colors do a decent job of resisting the watercolor paint but some tend to not resist as much as I'd like. These of these pens are keepers and I'll be using them until the ink is gone!Initially, I wasn't sure of the pop up feature. But, these pens, bah, don't worry about the exact size of the point.I
