But it's still useful to have a stand when one is needed, and the grip keeps my laptop from slipping off. The Belkin stand I tried from a friend before buying M Stand by Rain Design instead. Belkin stand does NOT have an angle to the keyboard that allows one to type on it while in the stand. I was really not looking for a laptop stand, but when I got a chance to take a look at tis one by Belkin, I decided to give it a shot. **** Build and Design ****There is really not much to this stand: it is made out of two pieces of solid anodized aluminum connected in the middle with a plastic ring. **** Functionality ****The stand did at first seem a bit flimsy, but after using it for a few days I am happy to report that both of the laptops that I tested it with - 13" MacBook Air and 15" MacBook Pro (the second lightest and the heaviest Mac laptops currently available, respectively) - were able to stat securely on top. **** Conclusion ****This is a fairly solid laptop stand that has performed as advertised for me. As this is just a simple stand, it will work with just about any laptop. This stand works pretty well. The Belkin Loft for the Macbook is a great looking stand. The stand has a rubber grip along the top that keeps your laptop from slipping; it does its job well. The stand itself, however, while easily strong enough to hold my 15 inch Macbook, gives under the weight of my hands if I lean them on the the laptop as I type. Also, if you plan to use this stand as part of a desktop dock for your laptop that includes a wireless keyboard then this would be a perfect addition to your setup. This stand is a good space saver also, as you can place objects under it for storage such as a wireless keyboard. Finally, this stand is very portable; I was able to assemble and reassemble the stand easily and, when disassembled into pieces, it can be laid flat in a suitcase or laptop bag for travel. Overall, I recommend this stand to anyone looking to raise up their laptop on their desktop except in the case of users who would be putting a lot of pressure on the stand when they type. This stand replaces a Griffin stand for holding a 15-inch Macbook Pro.
