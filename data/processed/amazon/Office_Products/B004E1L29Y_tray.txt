The tray moves vertically smoothly and effortlessly. I only wish the tray were slightly bigger, perhaps 11" instead of 9 1/2". The tray can be used for a left-handed or right-handed person, determined by how you install the board since holes are included for both positions. This tray is not meant for a pressed-wood, cheaply-made desk as installation requires an electric screw driver. The tray itself is made with some kind of dark grey polymer.Also make sure you will have room available underneath your desk top as you will lose about four inches of space.This brings me to the instructions. Shortly after I received this tray to review and found pro's and con's for both.First Impressions:The Fellows tray seemed very heavy. Weighing in at 14lbs, this tray is no light weight. They cling to the tray and can be removed if you don't like them. The tray also is adjustable, just raise it up and down and tilt to retract. This tray looked too wide at first, but it's just great! The tray pull in and out very smoothly. The tray utilizes a long track that it slides along and this is attached directly to the underside of your desk with screws. This tray earns the moniker "professional" ... it is definitely office quality. * The tray slides just about completely under the desktop. * The tray is too small to use the included wrist pads and a full size, semi-ergonomic keyboard. I removed it and installed this tray in no time. The tray felt very solid and moved easily. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this tray and will be replacing my other ones with it whenever they eventually break.Update April 2012: Adjusting my rating slightly because I have switched to a full size keyboard, and using that combined with my standard gaming mouse pad makes things a bit cramped. Also, the tray tilt has become a bit loose. The tray itself is 1/4" high density fiberboard so very solid.
