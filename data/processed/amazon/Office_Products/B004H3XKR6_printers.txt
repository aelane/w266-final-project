I've gone through many printers in my life, and this is by far the best one I've ever used. We have had HP printers and Canon printers in the past. I previously reviewed the Epson 635, and essentially, these printers are very similar.The 845 adds:- A full touch-screen panel, which has the color display in the center of "soft buttons". In the past other printers I have owned would set up very easily on the PC but were totally unfindable on a Mac or vice versa. I was able to set it up right at the printers screen.Built-in duplex printingThe holds a 500 sheet ream of paper between to the two traysFax/scan/copy all work well. I always buy Epson printers because of the rock solid stability and durability they offer and this workforce 840 is no exception. This turned me off to printers for years, I never saw a reason for needing a printer, especially if I was going to have to deal with all of that jamming. Again, with the old "other" printers, if you tried to do a two sided print and the paper jammed halfway through the printing, you were pretty much screwed. Again my HP printers are my benchmark, and the paper trays on the HP printers seem sturdier. In most other printers there is a manual bypass tray or similar unit that allows you to feed your one envelope in or use odd-sized paper without having to remove one of your trays and change the guides, etc.2. Of all the all-in-one printers I've owned, this one was the easiest and most intuitive to set up. I've had Epson printers for years now and every model has been great. I've had Epson printers for years and like it.- Very nice controls on the front of the printer- Access the memory card slots as mapped drive letters also wirelessly. Normally I hate all in one printers. I've been pleased with my Epson printers that I have used in the past and decided to stick with them. It seems like I tend to go through printers far too quickly. I can't promise it, but I'm willing to bet a Dell, HP, or Brother printers would not come with out of date software.
