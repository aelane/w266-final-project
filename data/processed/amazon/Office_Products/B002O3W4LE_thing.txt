First thing they ask me was lets test the device. The only thing I miss is that it doesn't send you your phone messages via email the way Vonage does. The nice thing about the Ooma is you can connect it directly to your modem if you wish and then run a line out to your router. The only thing that reminds us we are on Ooma is the little musical jingle when we push the send button.My wife has had a couple of dropped calls but one never knows if it is the phone you are using or the phone of the person you are speaking with that dropped the call. The hardest thing to get used to is the fact that the dial tone is different. The only thing you need is an internet connection because that is how you use the Ooma A VERY cool thing was when I plugged the Ooma directly into one of my wall jacks (now dead without AT&T; local phone service) and every single phone hooked up in the house now rings via the Ooma Telo connection. It is even more expensive than Ooma.One thing I don't like about Ooma is its caller id in basic plan. The first thing I want to say, that I hope proves useful, is that Ooma's own wireless adapterooma 100-0301-101 Telo Wireless Adaptordoesn't have very good reviews, so I tried thisIOGEAR Universal Ethernet to Wi-Fi N Adapter for Home or Office GWU627 (Black). The first thing I'm going to try is two of theseCommand Forever Classic Large Metal Hook, Brushed Nickeland slip the narrower end of the Ooma into them. They suggested sending the whole thing back to Amazon to get a new telo and then transferring over the account.
