How, exactly, does this product facilitate a sales presentation? I want to use the product right away when I receive it, and when the batteries are there and they're high quality, I really appreciate the extra step that saves me of having to go out to buy them.To save the battery life, the pointer/remote can be turned off by removing the USB stick from the puter and storing it inside the pointer/remote. Overall a great product. The Kensington Wireless Presenter is a great product. When I inserted it and then removed it again it started working.Overall this is a nice product that does its job well. A great all-in-one product. Also noteworthy is the product's simple and functional design. What an outstanding product this is. As with any electronic product, the true test is one of endurance--and that is really the one aspect that I will be unable to remark on.While the product listing does an admirable job listing the comparison to other Kensington products, it might be interesting to note that there are two separate units that look exactly alike. Even though this was the advertised product that I have to review for the VINE program, I actually received the lesser memory device (K72353) utilizing USB storage. It is a high-quality product - looks great, is well designed/engineered, and works fine but still, it is expensive.The design is thoughtful. Hence, I feel that, for $75, this product should feel solid in my hand as a high-end item, not some cheap rubberized plasticky stuff. This product should have 4+GB, preferentially 8+GB to minimize having to carry another thumb drive. With the People I know, theyare Librarians, so any Kensington product is just superb for whatever is needed. However, with what I have seen,including the current product being examined, the audience is very much a wider one.
