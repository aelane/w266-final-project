These pads do exaxctly as promised. They are extremely sticky pads with adhesive over most of the back of the pad. The pads are a bit thicker than regular post-its, but that seems to be a good thing. It makes it hard to get the pads out. These label pads would work great for labeling totes, boxes, reminder notes on the fridge, food storage containers, shipping labels, and thousands of more uses. These pads are a logical and well-thought-out addition to the Post-It product line. These label pads stay stuck until you remove them--they're great for labelling just about anything!I also like the colors...they make them easy to locate. You would think you know all there is to use after a few pads. These label pads are basically post-it notes but with adhesive on most of the paper. These label pads are an excellent idea for the person who likes to organize, but also likes to reuse the same containers and doesn't like picking off old sticker labels (what a pain). These label pads are another innovative application for the wonderful sticky note that 3M introduced a couple of decades ago. You get two neon pink pads (50 labels) and two lime green pads (50 labels).In a word: Brilliant! 4 pads in 2 colors is not as exciting as 4 pads in 4 colors. I can never have too many of those cute pads of paper for notes or whatever. There are 4 different pads, 2 pads are green colored paper, and the other 2 pads are a pink color. These label pads are like post it notes but with the whole back being sticky.So, the trick is, how do you get one label off the pad? These pads really are a great buy if you have a home office and you need simple organization. I will definitely pay to have these pads and I like that they come in different sizes too. These label pads are stickier so they don't fall off my plastered wall during the cold season.
