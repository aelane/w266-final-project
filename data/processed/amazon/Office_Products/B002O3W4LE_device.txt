Very pleased with the device. It took longer for the device to download the latest firmware than it did to install the hardware. I tell them its not the device, its your phone system switching and messing up and giving out duplicate number. This device was a perfect solution for my setup because of the wireless adapter.In my case, I could not set Ooma and a phone where my router is located because of the space constraint, and a non-wireless device would require running additional long wires to where placing the phone would be convenient. That device is much cheaper but does not have a wireless adapter. The Ooma device plugs into your modem or router and then into your home phones. OOMA has made this device very simple to install but some folks like everything to be done for them and here (obviously) the cable provider comes out ahead. I bought this device after a coworker raved about it.

When you initially connect the device, it begins to download updates.

After you buy this device you MUST pay between $3.50 to $4.00 a month (that is the absolute minimum - actual cost varies by zip code) every month to OOMA.
