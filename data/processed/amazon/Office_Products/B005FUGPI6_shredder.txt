The shredder head is built strong, while the base is also strong but it could have been slightly thicker to provide that extra sturdiness. So you never need to remove the shredder head unless you need to clear a jam. I have a smaller Fellowes shredder and it is a lot louder than this Powershred unit. This is a fantastic, heavy-duty shredder. I've had a lower-end Fellowes shredder by my desk for the past five years -- an 8-sheeter -- and while it worked okay, it was never great. I already own a heavy-duty Xerox shredder in our basement that we use for bulk shredding of old tax records, electric bills, etc. But I wanted another shredder to place next to the trash can in the kitchen so I could shred all those un-asked for checks that come with my credit card bills, credit card offers, etc. This new shredder has more power, cuts more sheets at a time, has improved safety features, BUT unfortunately has a design flaw in that the bin does not easily slide in, you need an extra shove to get it to seat into place. The Fellowes 75Cs Powershred 12-Sheet Cross-Cut Shredder is a very heavy-duty shredder. This shredder is not noisy which is a plus for me. This shredder is child / finger proof so safety has been considered. This is a great personal shredder. I have been using this shredder daily for nearly a month and have had no jams or issues. My previous shredder had a stronger motor and worked a bit faster, but this model is perfectly sufficient for low to moderate users like myself. This shredder is sleek and sturdy.

Not replacing my favorite Fellowes shredder.

I've had a different Fellowes shredder (the slightly more expensive, now discontinued Fellowes 32197 Powershred SB-97Cs Shredder) for some years now and this is not replacing it quite yet.

It's a powerful and fast shredder, and the noise level is low.
