I'll be comparing this printer to myEpson WorkForce 845 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer, Copier, Scanner, Fax, iOS/Tablet/Smartphone/AirPrint Compatible (C11CB92201)to give some of my criticism context. The printer is marketed as having a very small footprint. The printer does an excellent job at producing beautiful prints/copies but past that core functionality it falls far short for usability I think. I use this printer in a home office. I had to go online to find the correct printer drivers. * Cheaper to replace toner vs your average inkjet printer. Overall those it's a nice printer, though a bit pricey for what you get comparing it to other models that will also print faster and have auto duplexers. The Samsung printer is amazing! I love this printer. I love this printer. This little printer is all I need for professional communication. I need a reliable printer that is not too expensive and is easy to use. I haven't seen a functioning printer that didn't make wonderful prints in the last three years or so.I really like the compact size, which is perfect for home use.

The printer speed is faster than most inkjets and is more than enough for my uses.

It automatically found my wireless printer and I was printing all kinds of pointless stuff in no time.

Otherwise the printer is still working great and even still on the original ink cartridges.
