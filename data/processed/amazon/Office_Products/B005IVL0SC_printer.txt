This printer is very similar to the Epson WF635 that I also own. The printer looks nice and prints fast.The setup was very easy. I could not find a printer cable, so I used a wireless setup method. I was also prompted to update the printer firmware, which was also done wirelessly, and the computer guided me thhrough the process. I also have a Canon printer and can buy aftermarket ink for about fifteen bucks for three full sets of cartridges (that's 15 cartridges). I am not sure I understand why they would not include a printer cord given its marginal cost, especially when Epson says that the initial installation is faster using the USB (the printer gets network settings from the computer). While it can be argued that you would not need a printer cable with a wireless printer, I think it would provide a fallback option in case your wireless goes out at a low cost to the manufacturer.Also, for the menu navigation on the printer I prefer a wheeel like on my Canon printer to directional buttons of Epson, but this is just a personal preference.Overall, this is a very good all-in-one, I just wish there were options to get ink at a lower cost. This mid-sized All-In-One printer is just the right size for the home, home office or small business. I highly recommend this printer if you're looking for a high quality All-In-One printer for your home, home office or small business. Second printer has been great. This is a fast printer in both color and black and white. After trying this Epson Workforce printer, I have to admit I've been living wrong. I was very happy with this printer while it lasted. This printer is an upgrade from my previousEpson WorkForce 635 Color Inkjet All-in-One (C11CA69201). The printer is fast for a small home printer with good quality. This printer also scans beautifully and makes a quick and quiet print that has really good overall quality. Epson created a compact, feature-filled printer with a small footprint, a LCD, and simple controls. The 645 takes an already great printer and adds Apple's AirPrint and Google's CloudPrint. Glad the 645 doesn't change that and only makes it better.Review from 635:This printer is easy to setup, even on my mac, detecting much easier than my old printer did, however with Windows I believe you can set this printer directly up with the software provided. This printer has a nice small footprint. Otherwise, this is a great all-in-one printer for the money. This is my third Epson Workforce printer.... the first one died when I used non-Epson ink and it clogged the printheads (I am taking a star off this printer because their replacement ink is so ridiculously expensive). I've heard that it is cheaper to buy a new printer. I've noticed that each printer I've gotten lasts a shorter period of time than the previous one. I just love this printer! I really love this printer. I was quite annoyed though to find the exact same printer at Walmart a week after I bought this one, for about $40 less...  Do some price shopping before you take the plunge! Good basic printer. (To ship in the printer, of course!) My old printer, an HP all-in-one, was trouble from day one, and it seemed that every single day it was either warming up, updating, or failing to work properly. But you can connect the printer directly to your wireless router and then have your computer connect through the router with only a small amount of software download. This is our second Epson All-in-one printer and after using this one (and theEpson Artisan 837 Color Inkjet Wireless All-In-One with Fax (C11CB20201)) we have been so impressed with them that we'll likely stick with this brand in the future. I don't think I have ever had a printer that has been so easy to set up and use before and that hasn't give me some kind of conflict or error message. I will see how this works out as I use the printer more and see how fast it goes through ink and then will update the review. Hopefully, soon printer manufacturers will improve their technology with 'permanent' cartridges that offer an ability for users to re-fill with ease. I would recommend this printer to others.Marilyn Riggs, The Wizard of OS [...]Epson WorkForce 645 Wireless Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax (C11CB86201) After that, I simply opened my printer settings on my laptop and selected it. This printer is a few steps up form my Workforce 635 which I've reviewed in March of 2011. It locks the printer out and your stuck till you replace the empty ink, shame on you epson!Other than the ink situation the printer itself is fast in both scanning and printing but much slower if printing photos, especially on photo paper. I use this printer for copying and printing stuff off the web and leave the photo printing to my canon. I gave this printer 4 stars for the printer itself but not for Epson. First, the printer was very easy to setup. Not too long ago this printer would have cost 2-3x the price, and even today Epson makes ones that do cost that much more that don't offer better results for individuals. What you get is a solid printer that's easy to set up, uses top quality large ink cartridges, offers great text output (really laser quality), duplexing, WiFi, etc... )This is not a small printer, but it is not excessively large. Google Cloud Print lets you print to this printer from any computer, anywhere. Epson Connect works similarly to Google Cloud Print and actually assigns your printer an email address so that you can email documents or photos directly to your printer from anywhere!Really, there are so many features that I urge you to read the included quick guide and also spend some time checking out the more extensive online manual. You get what you pay for, and this Epson printer is a great value when you measure functionality against cost.Disclosure:Obtained From: Amazon VinePayment: Free If you are setting up the printer for a wireless connection you will need to connect it, via a USB cable, to your computer once. The printer will refuse to print.Also, Epson advertises that you can send double sided documents to the scanner and fax; this is true. Just don't be confused this is not a double-sided printer (with a duplexer). If you want to print double sided, the printer will print one side then instruct you to turn the pages and re-insert them into the paper tray.T
