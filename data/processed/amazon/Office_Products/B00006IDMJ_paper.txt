The paper is nice and smooth, and perforated for cleaner tear-outs. The paper is perforated for easy and neat separation. The paper seems slightly thinner than in the past but still good quality paper that is very consistent. Nice ruled paper has a couple of pockets for pens, paper clips, etc...It has a nice solid feel to it when you are caring it.Will be buying in the future! The paper is good quality, and not too thin. Very convenient and the paper quality is great. The paper is of very high quality with easy tear perforations if you need to tear out a page without worrying about having a shaggy edge and standard rulings. The paper is nice, having nice perforations, so that you can tear off a piece of paper give it to a friend (or teacher) without them getting all those little bits of paper on them.So, spend a buck or so more than the cheapest thing you can buy. The paper treats it nice and cleanly, and the plastic cover doesn't get all bent and ripped up after being thrown into a bag. The perforated paper tears cleanly. The paper is thick enough that there's little page bleed so both sides can be used. The paper is fine. The paper is smooth, and it does not have &#34;bleed&#34; issues with ordinary pens...I'm not going to give this to the marker user in the house, though. Paper is paper.
