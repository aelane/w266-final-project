The printer is easy to operate, and colors are nothing short of amazing...fine, detailed prints like nothing I've ever been able to produce.Drawbacks are probably what others mention...the matte black/photo black swapping thing is just silly, the ink cartridges are too small, at highest quality settings the printer's a bit slow, no built-in network interface, and the printer's physically a little on the large size.Still, for me it's all about the final image quality - and nothing I've seen tops the Epson in this regard.UPDATE:Okay, so I've been living with my R2880 for about sixteen months now, and I wanted to refute some of the claims other reviewers have made. I was recently gifted this printer instead of purchasing it myself. This printer does have a learning curve, that's for sure. It is much more sophisticated than your typical all in one or photo printer. I'm guessing you're looking at this printer to do high quality photos or art. Find another printer (such as an older 1800, 1900, 2400) instead. If the printer shakes much you'll be aligning the head more often. )....this printer isn't for the faint of heart. I love this printer. For those who DO buy this printer, I hope my tips will help. To do so, the printer primes itself and literally takes 7-10% of the ink to do it. As the printer primed the inks, it literally ran itself out the last 10% of both magenta and light cyan. It serves it purpose well, but its an expensive printer compounded by the costs of catridge replacment.Epson is touting its new Vivid Magenta and Vivid Light Magenta inks, which look to satisfy those who want heavily saturated prints. This printer has made me re-think my loyalties.Right off the bat, the print quality and speed are incredible. This printer is a desk monster, and there's certainly room in the print head for one more reservoir.2) There's a lot of trial and error in getting your prints to look like your images. I haven't used this printer with Windows yet, but I can tell you on the Mac side, you really need to get yourself acquainted with the driver, and it wouldn't hurt to know a thing or two about color profiles. The R2880 is a very large printer and you should plan to have some workspace set aside for it. This is an expensive printer and outperforms its competition in so many ways, but they couldn't include a slot for both cartridges? While the printer does have some pitfalls, it does do one thing very well: create outstanding photo prints. When setting up the printer, you must choose between installing the Photo Black cartridge (for printing on glossy and luster papers) or the Matte Black cartridge (for printing on matte and fine art papers). Although this printer is boasted to print phenomenal black & white photos, all of my prints have been in color. Although this printer is not nearly as whisper quiet as my Epson Artisan 800 Printer, it is still fairly quiet compared with most HP and Canon printers I have used in the past. This is a not a printer you can sit on a card table or small printer stand. You definitely don't have to worry about accidentally misplacing this printer, as its size boldly tells you "I'm right here!
