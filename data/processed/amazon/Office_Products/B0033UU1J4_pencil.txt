There is an auto-shutoff when your pencil is sharp, but if you want it even sharper you can push the pencil in a few more times. As far as it sharpening unevenly, what works for me is to sort of (gently) push the pencil in and out while also rotating it back and forth a little. Shock, I know.But, it's a pencil sharpener that if you read the description it uses all the fancy words to make it sound like it is the space shuttle of pencil sharpeners. You are greeted with a nice sleek looking pencil sharpener. It doesn't seem like it actually sharpens a pencil it just grinds it down into a cone shape and hopes the lead is exposed.After using this on a couple different pencils and getting the same result on each of them, I put this in a box and into the closet and resumed using my old one. This happens most often when sharpening a pencil which has a broken lead, or one that was previously sharpened by a different machine and therefore has a different shape.While the sharpener has sticky feet on the bottom, they aren't enough to keep the whole unit from turning itself. Pressing hard enough on the pencil to keep it from twisting again will engage the auto-off feature. One pencil didn't get a fine point, but maybe that had something to do with the quality of the lead in the pencil. I just rotated the pencil slightly as I sharpened it and it seemed to take care of that issue. If you had a pencil that was any larger than a standard pencil, it would not fit. I love not having to search for a pencil with a sharp point almost as much as I love the design of this sharpener. Putting a pencil into the top of a pencil sharpener at my age was truly a new experience. This pencil sharpener rocks. My old one could sharpen forever if you keep your pencil in it, the motor is going. The pencil is perfectly sharp, not overly sharp, and if one side isn't shaved enough, I stuck it back in and it finished it off. I'd much rather have long fine pencil points.The iPoint sharpeners take a little bit of practice to use. You put the pencil in the hole in the top of the sharpener and then push down lightly while keeping the pencil from moving. The pencil with the tip broken off sharpened with less attempts than the new ones but stopped short of having a pointed tip. Honestly, it shouldn't be this difficult to make a pencil sharpener that does its job. The pencil sharpener has an auto stop feature to make sure pencils are not over-sharpened. It is a bit different to use as you stick the pencil in from the top. Hmmm ... how to review a pencil sharpener? Okay, yes it certainly sharpens a pencil. My sole pencil sharpener has been a small hand-held one that prefers to chew up and spit out pencil leads, rather than sharpen the pencil. I've been hesitant to buy an electric pencil sharpener because of the space it takes up on my craft table. Finally a pencil sharpener whose design makes sense. This is a vertical electric pencil sharpener. Drop the pencil straight in and sharpen as needed. It's very fast, possibly the fastest pencil sharpener I've ever used. There's no sharpening the pencil after that. I like my pencil to be super sharp and this just doesn't achieve that. Does not accommodate large, nonstandard pencil thicknesses. What else could you want in a pencil sharpener? For a pencil sharpener, I find the price a bit steep for the simple job it performs: simply sharpening pencils. We sharpened every pencil in the house...twice...because she found it to be great fun to use and it was simple enough even for her to use. This pencil sharpener is excellent. It does what it's supposed to do, sharpens the pencil to a fine point. A pencil sharpener is a pencil sharpener, right? As soon as you insert the pencil intoplace and pressure it to sharpen, it takes but a few seconds tosharpen. It is designed for the pencil to be sharpened from the top instead of the side and HAD the pencil sharpener had enough power to sharpen a pencil, things would have been different with this review.That said, it took FOREVER to sharpen a pencil. Although the pencil does get very sharp, I don't like that it leaves only half of the point exposed, while the other half is still encased in wood. I sharpened pencil after pencil and this half and half design was 100% consistent. While the pencil is being sharpened the device moves and vibrates around, giving the impression of something cheaply made. Insert a pencil lightly and when the sharpener stops the pencil is sharp.It works just fine. One simply pushed the pencil into the top until the sharpener began to sharpen. When pushing a pencil into the unit, it would just spin without sharpening the pencil. Using it I found that putting a new pencil in and sharpening it 3 times I had half a pencil left. It pulls  the pencil in and eats it. This pencil sharpener looks great and is easy to hold with one hand while the other is sharpening a pencil. I was not terribly impressed with this pencil sharpener. First, pressing down lightly only causes the pencil to spin. The pencil points are just too short!I think I will be going back to my Boston electric pencil sharpener, which takes up more room, but sharpens pencils more to my liking! This  pencil sharpener is wonderful and easy to use. This pencil sharpener looks nice and doesn't take up much space on your desk, but it takes a bit to sharpen a fresh pencil. I inserted a new pencil and the sharpener would sharpen for what seemed like about two seconds and then stop. When it was completed, the pencil was fine, although the lead was a bit shallow. The pencil shaving reservoir is see-through, so that you know when to empty the contents. Be aware that this is for standard pencil sizes. The pencil shavings accumulate in the top so that you can easily see when the holder needs to be emptied. When you sharpen a pencil, no matter how you hold/twist/whatever the pencil, the sharpener leaves a piece of wood almost all the way up the tip. My other pencil sharpener sliced the pencil to a very steep-sloped point and the angle seemed to be just off because I was usually left with the pencil wood going nearly to the point of the lead on one side. It will release the pencil once it's sharp so you don't need to keep pulling it out and checking.H
