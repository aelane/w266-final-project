The larger tabs and color difference help correct this problem. The "super" tabs are a bit silly because even though the covering side is cut away, a regular piece of paper will cover up the extra tab space, so you really only have the typical area. I do like the 7/8" high oversized tabs and the expansion scoring that allows for 3/4" more space.All in all a very good product. If you write on the tabs with ink rather than pencil there is enough room to change what is written. * The large tabs allow you to put additional labels and/or notes about the contents of the file after the title. The tabs are not "Super" sized except in the sense that they are cut deeper than the old ones. The oversized tabs are perfect for a large label which ensures as much space as you could possibly need. I always prefer the third-cut tabs because you can fit a good deal of information in that space. Love the larger tabs at the top. I also appreciate the larger tabs that give me the space to add important, must-see-it-now info. The tabs are standard 1/3 cut tabs, BUT, they are TALLER - so they are indeed SuperTabs. I like the ultra-large tabs, so you don't have to try to perfectly fit tiny stickers on them, or write so small you can't read it later on. The tabs are large enough to be specific about what's inside the folder. These will last forever, and I like the bigger tabs for easy reference. The tabs are large enough to write longer descriptions or write bolder, bigger words on them. With these, the tabs stand up straight and tall and easily visible. Though it says the tabs are larger, they appear to be the same size as my other folders that I am currently using. The large tabs also enable you to write LARGER on them (which I am doing) or fit more words into the label area.They don't come with a set of labels - which would be a helpful extra, not that you'd need them initially.

The tabs are either left, right or middle, which if you are really super-organized, can come in handy.

Most have tabs that are difficult to see.

The tabs have extra room for writing which has always been an issue with the smaller tabbed folders.
