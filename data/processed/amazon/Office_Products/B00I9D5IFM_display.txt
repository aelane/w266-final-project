The display unit is about a 5&#34; square, and the display portion folds up from the button panel. * The display is  bright blue LCD, and visible from a reasonable distance. The display can show weight in either decimal pounds, pound/ounces, or kilograms. The display has 2 AAA batteries, or it can work with an included DC adapter. The display has controls for on/off, tare, changing units, and a hold button to hold the weight seen on the screen. The display is a separate component that has a coiled cord that can reach up to about 3', so it can be mounted on a wall or placed on a shelf for easier viewing. The display screen plugs into the scale base but doesn't have a place to dock it to on the scale - a feature that would have been nice. I have mounted the display, which folds out flat, on the wall behind this scale. The LED display has number 1/2 in. The display is bright and easy to read with various measuring modes, and its viewing angle is adjustable. The display is backlit, so it&#8217;s easy to read.This postal scale will measure boxes up to 110 pounds or as small as 1/10 of a gram, so the scale will measure almost anything that can be mailed.

By separating out the display unit and buttons, you can easily get to and view your numbers without trying to reach under the box and use braille to hit the right buttons. This impressive display of accuracy was repeated with several test objects. You can change the display to show the following weights:a.  poundsb.

The display is attached to the scale with what appears to be a telephone headset cable, which means you should be able to easily extend to a longer cable if the included 6' cable isn't enough.I found the scale to be accurate.

Because the display / controller is a separate unit, attached by what looks like a coiled telephone cord, it's easy to fit all but the largest and most cumbersome packages on the platform.

I connected the display to the platform and proceeded to test it out against another scale.
