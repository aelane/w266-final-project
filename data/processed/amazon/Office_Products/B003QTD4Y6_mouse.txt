This mouse pad does no harm. It works the same as any other mouse pad with that jersey cover. I must admit that a mouse pad is way at the bottom of the list of things I would ever consider buying given their general availability as 'freebies' at trade shows, real estate offices, car dealerships, supermarkets and sometimes gas stations but there are a few good things to say about this one so, let me say them.- It's black. There is not much to say about mouse pads in general. The mouse slides with ease and the grip on the back holds it very securely in place. $6 is a bit much for a basic mouse pad that can be purchased elsewhere for $3 or less. My mouse moves smoothly over it. But since it's nearly impossible to find a mouse pad with no images on it, this is about the best you can get. I have not used a mouse pad for many years because I get satisfactory results just sliding the mouse along my desktop. When I move the mouse one inch on the pad the cursor moves 19" on my screen. However, when I move the mouse one inch on my desktop without the pad it moves the cursor 17" on my screen. What can one say about a mouse pad? I used to have my mouse just sitting on my desk and technically my desktop is smoother and probably faster. It functions well allowing the mouse to move quickly and smoothly for fast play in gaming. As soon as I tried this mouse pad, I noticed a big difference over the other one I'd been using. My mouse glides much more smoothly as well as moves faster. It seems a little bigger than some mouse pads and the extra space is helpful. This is one of the larger mouse pads I've seen, measuring 9" by 8". This mouse pad is larger than any other I have used, and better made. This is a functional, basic mouse pad. This is a pretty solid mouse pad. I received this mouse pad as part of the Amazon Vine program, and it is a fine, functional mouse pad. I honestly can't say too much more about it since, well, it's just a mouse pad. If you want an inexpensive mouse pad that coordinates well with your computer, then the AmazonBasics Mouse Pad is for you. It is better than the fuzzy-surface mouse pads that I have been given free at the charity promotions such as the CFC Kickoff Rally held annually at the shipyard where I work. It is compatible with some of the slightly more expensive 3M mouse pads that I have at the shipyard - the ones with the scenes of mountains, beaches, etc.The AmazonBasics Mouse Pad is highly recommended if your usage of the computer is basic, meaning that you only use it briefly for work or entertainment purposes and you don't want to spend a lot of money. I wanted a simple black mouse pad, which is actually becoming difficult to find. This mouse pad is enough to get the job done, but if you're looks for a mouse pad with a great surface, ergonomic design or comfortable padding, this is NOT it. I frequently had to pick up my mouse and reposition it on the pad or slide my mouse completely off the pad while testing this pad.Considering that I've used free mouse pads that were given away at banks or at the time I purchased a PC that were better than this mouse pad I'm a little amazed that Amazon is selling this mouse pad for as much as they are.Again, if you just need a very basic mouse pad then this does indeed get the job done ... it's just there are a lot of other mouse pads out there for around the same price that do the job even better than this. It's a mouse pad. The mouse runs over it without a hitch. I mean - what is there to say?This is a thinish black mouse pad. This mouse pad is nice and thin so the drive can now fully open as it clears this mouse pad with no problem. I don't need a mouse pad with kittens doing jumping jacks on it! Is it a mouse pad? Does it work with my mouse? This mouse pad glides smoothly. Many mouse pads are textured on the top surface. It glides very well (I use an infrared mouse) and tracks perfectly. That comes with their new mouse pad. I was surprised that you really get a great add-on for any mouse you have for your desktop, or laptop you use at home that you're pretty tired from just the touchpad on the notebook alone. This is a nice mouse pad for the price. It just is what it is -- a nice black mouse pad. This mouse pad from Amazon isn't elegant. This mouse pad replaced one I'd used for far too long and was worn so smooth that it often didn't provide the friction needed to allow the mouse to work well. I selected this mouse pad, however, only because, in the Vine's early list of available items for selection, there was othing else that struck my interest. It may not be as fancy as other mouse pads out there (like the ones I tried before) but it looks nice and works as expected. This AmazonBasics Mouse Pad is exactly what it claims to be: a basic mouse pad. The mouse pad is plain (sleek) black, with a small "amazon basics" logo in the bottom right corner. It is the standard mouse pad size, but is a little thinner than the mouse pad I was using before this, which means my hand and arm are a little closer to my desk when using it. This is a well put together mouse pad that that is much better than  you run of the mill freebie mouse pads that you may get for promoting something. While rearranging, I had set my old mouse pad down on top of my new AmazonBasics and was sorry to see I deposited dust on the new black surface . This is a plain black mouse pad - the only imagery of any kind on the pad is the "amazon basics" logo in the bottom right corner. Overall a good, cheap mouse pad - nothing fancy or exciting but gets the job done.I
