Sharpie Brush Tip Permanent markers go on glossy, but they dry in the same amount of time. I love Sharpie markers in general, so this set was definitely something I wanted to try. These markers make it easier and faster to do larger pieces. These markers are just wonderful. Although these markers allow for more artistic expression, you can still use these markers for writing. I love these markers. I really like these markers. I used these markers to create posters for my classroom and let my students use them to create maps of the world. I use Sharpie permanent markers for so many things. Sharpie markers don't smear or run like the non-permanent markers do. These markers bleed through a lot and there is no using them lightly. The markers take a little while to dry so make sure that you don't touch where you used it for a couple minutes. Other than theSharpie Pen Fine Point Pen, 12 Black Pens (1742663)and theSharpie Liquid Mechanical Pencils, 2 Mechanical Pencils (1770244), neither of which worked as well as hoped, they always have great products.These markers are no exception. Unlike most other Sharpie markers I've got, the flow of ink wasn't consistent. I am very pleased and satisfied with these markers. Played around with the markers ... can do "artistic" things like draw monkeys with flowers ...then I can color each the proper color by shading in. The markers can be used on most surfaces. These new markers just make the artistic side of your task so much easier.One last artistic task:  Want to do tie-dye with the kids, but loathe the mess and the vats of dye? I only wish that these Sharpie markers had been invented at the time, so that the designs would have been even more interesting! Sharpie's Brush Tip Permanent Markers are excellent multi-purpose markers in vibrant colors. However, they could stand alone and are ideal markers for doodlers, illustrators and artists. These are just what they say, "Brush" markers. Even though they are listed as permanent markers, be careful on plastic items such as tape, freezer bags, food storage containers, etc. Unlike regular Sharpie markers, these are neither indelible or permanent. I look forward to using these markers to personalize a variety of other things from the dollar store. These markers are permanent and so easy to use, they just glide on paper. I would like to have some more of these markers. These sharpie markers work great for me. I still give the markers 4 stars because they work so well for me and do everything I want them to do. These markers play best with thick or quality art papers (think watercolour, mixed media, or acrylic paper).NIBOK. These sharpie markers are wonderful! These are excellent, permanent markers.

I love Sharpie markers.

However, having used these markers, I've had to scale back my expectations.As with my pen reviews, I'll look at some various angles: comfort, ink quality, and the nib.COMFORTMost striking with these markers is the deviation from the traditional and familiar Sharpie design.

(If using these markers on coated ceramics, however, you'll need to finish up with another clear coat to ensure the ink doesn't wash away.
