These are the most fun I have ever had with chalkboard chalk.There are 8 colors and come in a 12 pack.The red, green and orange are close to being neon they are so bright. I use a chalkboard to help me keep track of projects that need doing around the house. Use these on a chalkboard todo/dealines list and they are awesome. I'm just using it for a &#34;Word of the Day&#34; on a small chalkboard I have. It is easy to apply on the chalkboard I have and makes playtime even better. They are perfect for a chalkboard in school or otherwise. I put the chalkboard on the back of my door and use it to keep track of daily activities, sometimes I'll scrawl a quote on the board. I have been using these Chalk Sticks on my chalkboard for the past four weeks and I love writing in the old fashioned way. They work wonderfully on my chalkboard painted wall. we use the chalkboard for leaving messages for each other. Also  looks nice on a chalkboard.
