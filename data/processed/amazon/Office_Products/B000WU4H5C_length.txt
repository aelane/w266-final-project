The correct length to fit a standard no-frills keyboard. Other than the length, highly recommend in terms of durability, comfort and firmness. It is long so will go across the full length of a regular size keyboard. One plus is the length of the pad--it is much better than those that are shorter as the support extends the full length of the keyboard.Definitely great that it is so easy to clean, and feels very sturdy. That length, in itself, is not a problem, and for me it is an advantage. This length is a little long for my laptop (and probably for most) but would likely be the right size for a full-sized desktop keyboard. I can say, however, that it's the perfect length for the standard keyboard (i have the 18 incher) and the texture is perfect for me. 25" in length, supportive of my wrist and stays firmly in place on my desk top. Also, I have found the 7" length to been more effective as I move my wrist from side to side. It runs the length of my keyboard and extends to the mouse, so I can also use it when I use the mouse.Overall, this is a great wrist rest, but I do have one concern - the backing plastic. I did find that the 3M was slightly shorter in length than the keyboard I have at work, so I had to slide it to the left side of my keyboard tray to get the maximum amount of wrist rest where my hands are normally resting. I don't really like the extra length that goes over to the mouse. For me a regular length support would have been better, but this one still does the job.
