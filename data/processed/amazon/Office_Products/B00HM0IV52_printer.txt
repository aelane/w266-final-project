This is just a printer, not an all in one with scanner and fax included. This printer is really good, does a great job and I have lots of paper on hand now so that I can make those quality photos really stand out. I like this printer despite my vow to not use Cannon again. This printer has a lot going for it on the positive side1. It is an affordable 13x19 printer and the ink is not insanely expensive. It is relatively small for a 13x19 printer. It should be printed right on the printer like other products and companies do.Overall this is a winner. As I mentioned earlier, I set up the printer this way and have been using this way since. But what this is great about this printer is that for about half the cost you get very close to that standard, which is a great value. This printer has exceeded my expectations.So why four stars? This printer is large! It helped me understand how this printer functions, explains the flashing lights (power lamp, alarm lamp & WiFi lamp) &  has some useful tips too.+++++++++++++++From the On Screen Manual:"There are two kinds of black ink in the printer: dye ink (BK) and pigment ink (PGBK).The dye ink is used mainly for printing photos, illustration, etc., and the pigment ink is used for text-based documents. We recommend you to use the printer at least once a month. I haven't used this printer long enough to comment on ink usage.Great photo printer but I miss the LED screen & the copy & scan functions. At this printer's price point, it's still fairly high but palatable. The main printer itself was shipped with 2 simple Styrofoam buffers on the side that were easy to remove with no Styrofoam bead mess. The printer itself had 2 large "sticky covers" to remove plus one small one to protect its finish. Sadly, this printer boasts NO touchscreen LCD display. I had to replace my HP printer recently and the newer model didn't support it anymore. I have at least one printer hooked up to the network I tried hooking this printer up to. I can't get this printer to connect to the network. "The printer could not be detected on the network." Unfortunately where I have the printer does not allow me the usage of a USB cable to at least TEST the printer; however, I selected a wireless printer, not a wired printer (all my printers are wireless...even the one in my classroom that I use). :(If you want a wired printer...go for it. It's a great printer. I'll update as I use this printer further, but thus far, it is Recommended. This printer was used to print large size photos of dogs. The printer is very big and bulky and takes a lot of desk space. My first Canon printer was the Pro 9000 but then I got the Pro 10, both fantastic photo printers. Faster then my other two printers.Unpacking the printer with all of the tape and foam protection was probably the hardest thing to do. And that is where this printer separates itself from the Pro line. Every other Canon printer I own has an Ethernet port, even the ones that call themselves 'wireless'. The printer itself is similar in design and features to my Canon Pro-10 and Pro-100 'Professional' photo printers, which are two amazing printers. This printer isn't quite as big (a few inches shorter) and doesn't seem as violent when printing (the Pro-10 and Pro-100 shake my printer table quite a bit). I'd highly recommend this printer to anyone looking for a photo printer at a very reasonable price. I downloaded the printer driver from the Canon website, thus bypassing the setup CD, and that worked fine. Remember, though, this is just a printer, not an all-in-one. This printer makes amazing prints even on just plain white paper. I connected the printer via USB and had to download the "Canon IJ Network Tool", which allowed me to connect to the printer and configure it with my WiFi. I keep this printer turned on, but if you don't use it for a while, it will still take about a minute to "warm up" (I really don't know what it's doing) before it will start printing anything. When Canon came out with their Bubblejet printer back in the 1980s, it changed the face of inkjet printing. But with this printer in particular, I wouldn't recommend it. The printer comes with a quick setup guide made up of pictures for the most part, with limited text. I own both this printer and a Canon Pro 9000 Mk II photo printer (now superseded by the Pro 100). This printer prints good, high resolution photos, but if that's your primary purpose, you're better off with one of the Pro series...besides the cyan, yellow, magenta grey and black cartridges,  the PRO100 includes light versions of grey, cyan and magenta. If it's your ONLY printer, the lack of fax, scanning and copying capability is a big loss and will be the deciding factor for some. I also own a Canon 9000 MkII and a Canon Pro-10.This printer is a breakthrough in price/performance/versatility. The Mac was smart enough to still see the printer and let me use it, but it would not support the 13x19 mode.
