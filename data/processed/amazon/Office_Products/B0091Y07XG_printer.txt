This is my sixth Epson printer and although it is not as powerful as either the Workforce 840 or 845 that I use frequently, it is excellent for a printer its size. That said, this is a very easy printer to setup--the ink loads easily and set it up as a networked printer follows the typical process found on other Epson devices. This is not a perfect printer. The printer is compact, but provides incredibly fast, high quality prints. Overall, a great little printer that meets all the needs of our family. Once I got it set up, I was very happy with the printer's small footprint. I've had this printer for just about 5 months, with, I would say, normal use...mostly document printing, but a fair amount of photos, both 4x6 and 8x10. It almost feels like I'm going to break the printer doing it this way. This is a very full-featured printer and I don't think the current price point is unreasonable considering everything it can do. I was ready for a new printer and having had a prior Epson printer and currently having an Epson scanner, I researched various Epson printers and despite having no reviews on Amazon at the time, I dove for this one. When I do, I will repost.PRINTER SEEMS FRAIL AND MADE OF MANY MOVING PARTS:What first struck me with this printer, is that it seemed fragile and fussy. As short as this printer is, there are multiple paper trays. We needed an Epson printer email that took a day and a half to obtain, only because the site  had a circular logic to it. While I registered the printer, and Epson acknowledged it, this was not visible to me in my account settings at the main Epson site. My printer was not acknowledging this, so I could not install the software. I can say the printer works very well and gets weekly use. I'm very pleased with the printer to date and despite the issues of the mobile setup would recommend this printer to anyone.I still am not thrilled about including the LCTM client in the software package as it if is to my benefit. This is my third Epson printer and I've had good experience with every one of them. The Expression Premium XP-800 is a very impressive printer for home use at an affordable price.... The printer wont print pictures to regular paper tray without some hokus pocus that I cant figure out. I like the printer, but it does have its flaws. Smallest I have seen on any printer. Unlike some printer manufacturers, Epson seems to realize that many (perhaps most?) Initializing the printer takes under 10 minutes (once only), then installing the first computer takes 5 minutes and each additional computer takes about 3 minutes (assuming you install all the capabilities, like FAX and OCR. Unpacking the printer was not bad. I generally use an Epson WorkForce Pro WP4540 so I was interested to see how this far smaller printer would compare. The printer came with a CD which installed software on my OS X 10.8.3 system. Accessing the printer via its IP address allowed me to update the firmware with the latest version. I was quickly able to register the printer with Google Cloud Print services, and it can be easily accessed from iPhone/iPad for printing as desired.Printing:First of all, the XP-800 has 5 ink cartridges including both black and photo black, and the printer delivers a 5760x1440 dpi maximum resolution (this is superior to the 4800x1200 of Epson's office printers) at a 12 ppm speed for black or 11 ppm for color. The printer has the ability to print directly on CD/DVDs that have that capacity; I briefly tried launching the PrintCD software but found it immediately quit - this was the only software that I could not get to work. I'll be looking at that printer in the next few weeks and will post a review at that time comparing the two. This is a very good all in one printer. This is a really great all in one small printer. This is a great printer for sure. This Epson printer easily produces the best color print quality in side by side comparisons. The printer is a beautiful design and quite compact. You need a printer that is Airprint Compatible. (This printer is also compatible with Google Cloud Print.)2. You can email right from the printer or your Epson iPrint app! The printer does accommodate a variety of paper sizes in the trays - A4, letter, legal as well as 4 x 6, 5 x 7 and 8 x 10 photo papers. )This particular printer is intended to print photographs as well as general printing, so it includes a special photo black ink cartridge. )The printer does a couple of little "magic tricks" like opening the output tray all by itself. Epson says this is normal, not to worry.All in all, this is a great little printer with most of  the functionality of its big brothers and lots of extras! The Epson Expression XP-800 Wireless Small-in-One Color Inkjet Printer, Copier, Scanner, Fax is a printer packed with features in one small configuration. The last printer ended up going back to the store for it's complicated installation and horrendous print quality. If you are looking for a printer that will work seamlessly with your iPad, iPhone or Macbook, make sure it specifically mentions "AirPlay" because wifi print and AirPlay are not the same thing! I plugged in the printer on a hutch in the corner of my office because my desk just doesn't have enough real estate for another large gadget. There it was in my printer options! Love this printer! This is a fairly basic printer, at least in terms of quality. The WF-2540 is currently my main printer. I decided to install the printer as a network printer (wired, not WiFi). The printer was instantly recognized when I connected it to my switch/router. This printer does 2 sided scanning as well, which the WF-2540 does not.The interface / driver between my PC and the printer is really good. This is an attractive printer, not as giant as the Artisan 800 was, and fits nicely on my printer-desk. This is a solid printer, but be aware that Epson printers do consume ink quickly and you won't be able to get the "estimated yield" from an ink cartridge. I ended up plugging the printer directly into my router via ethernet cable and it connected to my network just fine after that. While I enjoy the printer, it really is disappointing to have to keep it wired to my router. ", I decided to take out all but Black - which caused the printer to freak out and cry about not having its whole collection.Well, on a printer that's fairly new, I'll just RMA it. I got to trade my shiny new (albeit broken) printer for a refurbished model that was scratched everywhere, and had mysterious "splashes" all over one side. Epson replaced my broken printer with... ANOTHER BROKEN PRINTER! And since I now have to return the first printer within 7 days to prevent a charge on my credit card, and the replacement replacement printer may or may not come, I get to go twice! For this Epson XP-800 printer that would be these features:* duplex scanning with automatic document feeder (ADF)* duplex printing* dual paper cassettes* attached memory card (or USB device which isn't made clear that you can do that)Breaking down these features pros and cons:The duplex scanning with the ADF works, but at a rate of speed useful probably for only home use. I originally set the printer on top of a small two drawer file cabinet I have that is just a bit shorter than my desk top. At first this seemed like it was going to work fine but after using the printer and having to bend over and peer at the tray/feeder to see why it wasn't feeding very well, I moved the printer to "higher" ground. I am pleased as can be with this printer, which I'm using with my Mac Air.General info:1. However, I don't believe the Expressions XP800 was ever intended to be  positioned in the Epson printer family to serve as the first choice for moderate to high volume print needs.Physical CharacteristicsDespite inspired marketing, the "small in one" XP-800 is essentially the same size as the Workforce 2540, being merely one inch less in height due to the different configuration of the 30 page automatic document feed - acknowledging the WF2540 requires more clearance space above once it is loaded with paper - about two inches less in width but nearly two inches more in depth resulting in an effective footprint of similar dimensions. As noted above each printer will handle print requests from a USB stick without computer intervention. The Expressions printer also had superior color saturation but I didn't recognize any significant difference in resolution between the printers or can I state I noticed any major differences in drying time on matte or glossy paper due to the distinctions in ink composition.The positive side is this is as my second set up of an Epson Printer with Epson Connect  I am slowly beginning to understand the application. I decided to connect this Epson XP-800 printer directly to a Windows XP system to be used as a dedicated printing and scanning device. After I went into the printer properties and selected the paper type and resolution to print, I allowed the printer to print my image. This is a great little printer. Getting the printer setup was a trick. Choosing a printer depends on what you are using it for and how much you want to spend. For me this printer does not do anything special and is a bit pricey. This printer is also cloud print compatible, and I appreciate that setup for cloud printing was simple and painless. I think this has the potential to be a great printer, but I feel they may still have some kinks to work out of the design - probably the second generation will be a much better printer. Very happy with this printer. The Epson Expression Premium Photo XP-800 was the perfect printer to replace my old one one my limited-space desktop. Photos come out fabulous - as good as any printer that's made just for printing photos.My husband likes that he can print direct from his smart phone or tablet - even if he's not at home! Wow, this printer is amazing. The printer uses separate cartridges for each color so that you only have to replace the ones that empty. It is a wonderful all in one printer. This is by far the best printer I've owned. The Epson Expression Premium Photo XP-800 is a great little all-in-one printer, IF what you are looking for is a photo capable printer, that prints photos, CD/DVD covers, etc. If you're looking for an all-in-one printer, I'd recommend Epson's Workforce series, which comes with larger capacity, quick printing capability, etc. Overall, this is another outstanding Epson printer offering for home/light office use. First of all, this printer is perfectly sized. !Overall, great printer. The printer is easy to set up. I previously had to use Printopia with my old printer but this time the software worked and I went to the Epson site and set it all up.6) What I did have trouble with was setting up my fax - I couldn't do it from the computer but had to do it directly from the printer itself.Except for the size of the paper tray, these are all minor quibbles and should pose no real problem after setup. As I have both, its important for the printer to work on each OS with no issues. As you might imagine, the XP-800 is a superior printer that can be used for the home office. This is a great printer. I would recommend this printer to the beginner photographer I got this printer to go in my daughter's room. This printer is a great size to set on a desk, or small table.The printer comes packed well, and I do mean well. I needed the printer and made an emergency purchase at a local Staples of the updated version, XP-810. I have been looking high and low for a printer for my iPad that would also work with my other devices, including my Toshiba Laptop. This printer fits the bill and then some.The pictures are crisp and clear, the printing is bright and highly readable, and it doesn't take up a ton of room in my office.
