This printer has a lot of features (copying, scanning, faxing, duplex printing, duplex auto-feed) for the price, but you will end up paying an arm and a leg in ink costs if you use it very often.Like:- Image and scan quality (consistent w/ Canon's usual great performance)- Auto feed duplex scanning: you can easily scan or copy a stack of paper- Duplex printing: great paper saver- Dual tray loading (rear and cassette)Dislike:- Wireless setup is a major pain. Still, having said all that, this is the BEST printer / scanner / copier / fax machine I've ever used and I absolutely love it.~ Ana Mardoll Finally a printer that actually copies, faxes, scans AND prints beautiful pictures. I loved this printer and used it for many years. I have been pleased with this printer, especially for the price. I simply use it as a wired printer and gave up on that function. Very nice looking printer. I am very pleased with this printer and would definitely recommend. We really like this printer a lot mostly due to the wireless capability and wide range of features. Now we have one printer that is always available and doesn't require a print server. I believe this may be the best, all around All-In-One printer currently on the market, but it does have some annoying characteristics. great printer although it can be a little loud. Before receiving the Canon PIXMA MX860 printer, we have been using multiple printers, anEpson Stylus photo R1800 inkjet printerfor photographs and aCanon PIXMA iP6220D printerfor other printing needs. Lastly the printer is connected to a computer LAN or wireless network.This machine prints documents pretty fast when used as a printer, with excellent quality printouts. We use this printer for scanning and saving to PDF's as much as we do for general printing and we love the automatic doc feeder that will PDF a whole stack of pages into one file. And even though the Xerox printer costs more than this Canon, there are so many things the Xerox doesn't do compared to the Canon. The printer has the usual slots on the front to allow you to insert your camera's memory cards.ScanningWhoopee! Otherwise, it looks like the printer should ship well. I haven't used the printer enough to get a sense of long-term reliability; after a couple of thousand sheets of paper, it's been jam free and solid. Canon printer ink is good stuff as far as I am concerned.Scanning works wonderfully well and the Canon software included with the Pixma MX860 itself provides quickly available and simple solutions for most of my printing/graphics needs that arise on a daily basis.When purchased in 2009 this Canon Pixma MX860 replaced a very tall, large/bulky and extremely noisy HP multifunction device which had great difficulties connecting to my wireless network. Canon will be getting all of my future printer business unless something unexpectedly better comes along.UPDATE (10/10/2011)My MX860 printer unexpectedly died yesterday after 28 months of very satisfactory continuous use, Error Code 5C20 - apparently a defective logic board. I hope that the new Canon printer is a bit more durable and lasts 1 year longer.
