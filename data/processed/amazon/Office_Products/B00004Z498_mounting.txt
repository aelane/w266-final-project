I just barely missed out on Scotch's new mounting tape, which more readily can be taken off most surfaces without residue or remnants of its backing.This is essential, for any time you move or otherwise have a reason to take down something from your wall, it leaves a mess that you have to scrub with the abrasive side of a kitchen sponge.Having stated that objection, Scotch's 1/2" Mounting Tape has plenty of uses:  It is great for those stubborn posters that refuse to stay up when you refuse to mar your walls with thumb tacks.I've used this product (and other sizes as well) for putting up a simple dry erase board with a cardboard backing. This mounting tape works very well to walls or smooth surfaces.It can hold posters, post cards and other not too heavy papers and decorations.Scotch is a good reputable name whose products are good quality and reliable.This tape is another fine dependable product. I've used their mounting sprays, "invisible" tape, and for commercial applications (mounting permanent signs) with their 3M VHB foam tape. This mounting tape (double-sided) is very strong. This is useful and highly adhesive mounting tape that can be used for a number of applications. This Scotch mounting tape is sticky enough to hold heavier items, but it also removes easily without taking the finish with it. Some mounting tape is not gonna stick to slick surfaces no matter how much you use, but with this product, only one two-inch strip firmly held tiles I mounted above our cooktop. This mounting tape is permanent - so place it where you want it to stay. Scotch mounting tape is part of my tool box arsenal. This mounting tape worked great for cord control, routing and organization. Scotch mounting tape, however, does the job. The permanent mounting tape is easy to use and seems to work well so far. This mounting tape has worked out well on many different surfaces. Instant mounting and they hold great!I also tried using this tape to mount a couple of plastic in boxes (the angled ones designed for wall mounting) on the side of a file cabinet. This mounting tape would be excellent for mounting poster boards.

Double sided mounting tape seemed like a great idea.The trial was made with a framed picture weighing about eight ounces.

This mounting tape held on longer than any similar product, but that isn't saying much.

While the mounting of objects on walls is a great use for double-sided tape, its unintended uses are also very practical.Being able to "test-fit" components with this type of tape before final (glued) assembly is particularly handy.
