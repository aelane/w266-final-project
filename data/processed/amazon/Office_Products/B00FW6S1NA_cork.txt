The cork was damaged just opening the package.I don't have high hopes of this lasting very long in my teenage daughter's room. I have other cork boards that are surrounded by a wood frame and they are much sturdier. This cork bulletin board works if you need something inexpensive for the size given. Since I already own a heavy, beautifully-made framed cork bulletin board, I was a little disappointed when this product arrived. The cork is very thing and flimsy, and the frame is just thin strips of plastic. They work great and are easily removed.Overall, while this cork board isn't horrible, I don't see any reason to recommend it, either. If you're looking for a cork board that can be hung and on which you can mount a lot of things, this is not the cork board for you.If you're looking for a lightweight corkboard that is portable and that you won't be mounting (temporarily or permanently), this might work for you.For your consideration:Pros:&#62;Lightweight and small in size, so very portableCons&#62;Very cheap looking plastic frame with obvious seams. It's just a cork board with a plastic frame. The cork is quite thin (I have other bulletin boards in my home with much thicker cork), which might be a problem in hanging heavier items (a calendar, for example), but for most purposes it's adequate.But, keep in mind that the "self-stick pads" which are used to mount the bulletin board are PERMANENT. This is a pretty flimsy cork board. The cork is of good quality, small grain size so you shouldn't have any issues sticking things on. The cork is uniform and thick enough to hold the pins without any problems. The cork isn't sticky and weird. All cork boards aren&#8217;t created equal. If you are looking for a cork board within the constraints of a very limited budget, this may be the product for you. The cork is quite thin, but will definitely hold a push pin [not included].

This cork board is inexpensive and you get what you pay for.

This cork board weighs next to nothing.

The cork part is fine.....and that is it.
