It holds minimally and slides over the surface. Just set it on a hard surface, pull up on the tape, and it will stick to the desk. The only surface it worked on was my printer top, but I wouldn't keep the dispenser here. However, it does not prevent it from sliding around on the surface. If your surface is slightly uneven, forget it. The gripping surface doesn't seem to be degraded by sunlight or leave any type of residue on the desk, which has been a problem for me when using some other desk accessories with rubbery surfaces. It's obviously got a finished surface and the little rubber disk on the bottom of the dispenser will NOT stick to my desk. I'm not sure how it manages to do it, but it grips whatever surface it's sitting on without damaging the surface. I used it on a solid surface countertop, a wooden table and a wood floor and it gripped to all surfaces without issue. If you have a VERY smooth surface with no grit, it works. When placed on a smooth surface, it sticks to it and will not come off easier (but move it to the edge of the surface and it comes right off). I thought maybe it had to do with the surface of my desk and have tried it on glass surface and got the same result.While that's one flaw, I found that it was very easy to take a tape out and use it.
