I got these wardrobe boxes just in time to move into my new place. These wardrobe boxes were a great idea to get at least SOME of my stuff packed and protected and OUT of my Barbie-sized closet.I looked for some instructions in the (bigger) box these arrived in and there weren't any. These wardrobe boxes are sturdy and roomy enough to hold many items and there is space on the outside to write exactly what's IN the box, which is always a great help. It is a storage/moving wardrobe box. These are sturdy and easy to assemble wardrobe boxes. This is a very sturdy wardrobe box - very similar to what you would get from any mover. I was very curious indeed to see how the Banker's Box wardrobe compared to the U-Haul version, if any. The BB is similar to the UH "Shorty" wardrobe, except the price point- the BB is nearly twice that of the UH. These wardrobe boxes come with a heavy duty hanger bar. This wardrobe box was no exception. The SmartMove wardrobe box fits a lot of clothes and you can assemble the box with no sweat.
