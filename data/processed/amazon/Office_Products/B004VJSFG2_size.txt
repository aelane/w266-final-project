Good size. These are the same size as Post It notes (although this cube has 400 sheets which is way more than a standard Post It stack), they stick and release exactly like Post Its, the thickness of each sheet is about the same, and the colors are vibrant and pleasing. They are just the right size and the sticky is strong enough that you don't have to worry about the reminder, note or appointment falling on the floor. Substantial size, pretty colors. They are just the right size, will stick more than once and a fantastic color that zi can share with my kids. At least this is more visually interesting.The size of this cube is 3" X 3", so not too small to write on. Not only is this the perfect size to keep by your phone, it also has the perfect amount of sticky to it so that you can rip it off and stick it on the fridge, or just about anywhere (except on your nine-year-old.) the size (3" by 3") is a good size for me because it's just enough paper for a note (for me). Of this size, the top 1/2 inch is glue, and this is light enough not to cause problems with over-sticking, but strong enough to stay in place.Next, I especially like a company that gives back to the community, and the Avery company does this.

The 3x3" size is also good for shopping lists, address labels, notes to stick on someone's door, and any number of uses.

The 3 x 3 size is large enough for a short handwritten note, but small enough that if it's just a flag for attention, I'm not wasting paper.

I love the size and how the cube stays together.
