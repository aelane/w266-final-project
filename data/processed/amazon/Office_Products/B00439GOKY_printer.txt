This printer does a good job. This printer seems average. I have not used this printer to print photos, so I can't comment on those. Yes, you can hear the printer, but the sound does not bother me. The printer is easy and smooth to use. So, I picked this printer specifically for the wireless capability and with the added bonus of being a high quality laser printer.The setup was easy--the instructions were super easy to follow and it only took about 15-20 minutes to get it setup and printing wirelessly. Other than that, this is a great printer that would work great on a small business or home network. We're totally pleased with the printer. Installing the printer on your computer was also simple and straightforward. This printer does a great job on text, and is fine for casual use--but I found it just too aggravating in terms of speed--if I wanted to print a document quickly so I could jot down some notes while I was on the phone, I could easily have to wait 2-3 minutes to get a printed copy of the document (maybe 5 pages of text). Still a good printer if you don't care about speed and don't need copier/scanner capabilities.

I am very happy with this printer.

This printer produces better quality prints than the Lexmark, takes up about the same amount of space, but also is a fair bit louder.

This printer is quite a bit slower than the Canon to print a page of black and white text; most of that is due to the length of time it takes the printer to wake from sleep.
