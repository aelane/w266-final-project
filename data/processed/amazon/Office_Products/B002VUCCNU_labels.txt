These labels cover an area completely and work perfectly with both the post office and E-bay Web sites. I've used them to create labels with USPS's Click-N-Ship program as well as with PayPal Shipping, and on both platforms they print out very clean, bright, and professional looking. Because the labels are so nice and thick, they don't wrinkle at all once on the package, and they entirely block out any old labels or markings on the box underneath.
