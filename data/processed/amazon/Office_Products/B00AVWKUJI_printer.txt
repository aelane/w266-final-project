As much as the printer frustrated me, the quality of the fine printing is quite stunning.Of course,  printing a few of my fine photographs also ran the ink cartridges down. When I received the printer, I installed the software on my MacBook. This printer lists at $99 and is currently selling for $79 at Amazon. This printer faxes, scans, copies and can be used wirelessly. However, the printer required me to perform this step twice at different stages, and the second attempt, requested by the CD-ROM install process, even seemed to puzzle the unit, which noted that the handshaking had already been successful.Another positive has been the ease of printing from my first-generation iPad. However, changing the printer's onboard settings to use less-generous amounts of ink is counterintuitive, to say the least.The basic mechanical setup of the unit is pretty simple, and the pictorial reference sheet is clear about the process. All in all a decent printer, but I actually prefer my older model because it was a lot easier to set up out of the box.1. I was pretty excited to get this printer due to it's multi-function capabilities. I use this particular printer mainly to print photos. So I can't wait to get really creative with this printer!Obviously I like this little printer since it is the second one I've gotten! However, as a basic printer, The PIXMA performs well. The printer is compact enough and would be a decent choice for light-medium home use. AirPrint Compatible (C11CC31201)still the best printer I'll ever have. This is my 4th Pixma printer (one having been destroyed by a power surge, nothing to do with Canon). This printer could have solved that problem.It is truly an all in one machine: copy, print, scan, fax; however, it exceeds the size of any of the others save my 30 year old HP laser jet (and that was an industrial office machine). I can not think about much which would recommend this printer. I sent the printer back! This is the second printer that I have connected to my computer wirelessly. But I was able to find and print to the Canon MX452 on my first try.This printer is shockingly heavy and big. The printer is very light, so unpacking, situating it and plugging it in was not arduous. I recommend this printer for people who have issues with bending and lifting.My primary use for the Pixma is the AIR PRINT feature, allowing print directly from iPad, iPhone devices, but it also had to do a wireless connection to a Win7 laptop and a desktop. The printer won't wake up on its own. Our previous printer (also a Canon) made scans but it was SOOO slow in both of its primary functions that it was PAINFUL. This printer works great and I have had no problems with it. It is nice to have a printer and scanner at home, but this one was overbilled. This printer is full of great features which include a fax machine, a scanner, copier and photo printer. Since getting this printer, I have used the copier and printer (color and black and white) and the scanner and I have found all of them to work perfectly. It's rare to find a printer that really is equally suited for home and office use, but I'd say this is it. My previous printer was a Canon Pixma MG4220, after several years of using HP printers. For $40 more you will get in the MX5232 a slightly more attractive printer that fees ore substantial, works a bit more quickly and has a larger rage of future All of this is enough to enable me to recommend the PIXMA M5232 with far more enthusiasm than the still very good but less fuller featured MX452. )So basically, if you find this printer for dirt cheap and it's the best you can afford, sure, why not. The printer function is clear and prints quickly. I gave this printer 4 stars because of the scanner function. Great printer, not so great scanner. I do however, feel this is a great printer for the money. Most of my printer jobs go to the Dell laser. This printer only uses two, but I am not sure if that is an advantage or not. I think Canon is the best printer maker period.

Neither printer required any physical connection to the router nor any computer for Network set up.There are lots of options for both printers--the trouble is, with the 452, it's hard to maneuver the menus because it is hard to see the screen.

My current printer has this, and once you have had it, you don't want to go back.The Fax programs are the same, and work equally well.

BUT there are many differences.If you are looking for a utilitarian-looking printer, the PIXMA MX452 is a good choice, but the screen is not very easy to read, and you have to do a LOT of scrolling to get through the menus.
