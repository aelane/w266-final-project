I noticed that some colors are repeated (like neon yellow, of which I probably don't even need one), while others (like black, which I'll probably use the most) aren't. Some of the colors seem to be the duplicates until you hold them up to a light or look at them in the sunlight. They write well and I like the colors and variety. They write smoothly, and the colors are vibrant. Below is how the colors are listed in the description, but I wasn't able to tell the 0.7 mm pens from the 0.8 mm pens. The colors are bright and vibrant and there is virtually every color you can think of in this set! And now they come in sooooo many colors!! So many colors! These are pretty colors, very bright. This makes it easy to distinguish the colors. The colors are described as "check safe." We can pick new colors monthly if we want (one of us wants this option).5. Separate colors help me keep groceries lists organized. The colors are fun and plentiful, and crafters out there will love the variety. The colors are simply gorgeous. Although some colors are really light, most are dark enough to see on a sheet of white paper (the light yellow pen being the exception). The colors include gold and a silvery grey. The colors are muted -- not what you'd call primary colors. Bright rich colors, flow easily from pens. The colors are bright, rich, beautiful -- the quality of ink is exceptional. I wasn't going to try to put all the colors together (there ARE 68 pens after all), so I ended up putting them randomly in the stand. And yep, many of the colors look the same or almost the same. However, there were not 68 unique colors, so be warned...When the pens arrived, they came in plastic bags with the holder separate. When we started sorting them out, we realized that most of the colors were duplicates (one triplicate, and three singles). They write smooth and the colors are vibrant.

The colors are vibrant and attractive.The stand that comes with the pens is a cheaper feeling plastic stand.

The colors are strong and even so, you don't see the ink on the other side of the paper!

It's sturdy and you can easily see which colors you want to select and put them back without knocking any other pens over.This set is great for kids and adults.
