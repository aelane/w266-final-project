These pens don't over bleed or run, they are smooth. But, I have cheaper pens that don't give me this problem, so that's why it annoys me. The pens do write beautifully and smooth, though, which is why I still recommend them if you don't mind retracing your letters every now and then. The more expensive pens from uni-ball seem to be free of this problem though, so if you've got the cash, you might want to try one of those as well. These are my absolutely most favorite pens...the lines are clean and smooth and lay down jsut the right amount of ink. These pens are great, they are very stylish on the outside and are made of recycled electronics! From now on when I am out of pens, I will continue to buy these great pens! Also I have noticed that the pens work great at a certain angle, otherwise the ink flow is not consistent and it doesn't write. These Uni-ball pens are my favorites for writing. Since having retired and not receiving anymore of these pens, I recently used up the last one I had from work. First of all, I know pens. I usually buy pens 6 dozen or so at a time. I don't use black pens since I always want to tell an original from a copy.The one problem is that I tend to write faster and less legible with this pen. I buy my own pens and these are not cheap pens by any means, but I do a lot of writing and I like to have a pen that I know will write well, not skip or sputter and that just generally feels good in my hand.
