The scan quality is superb and the print quality is excellent for this printer's class. Printing quality is excellent, but when Epson recommends using Epson paper for photo printing you better believe them (hard earned experience using generic Kodak photo paper which smeared all over); per page costs (ink only) about 10 cents at current rates (Epson T273520 Epson Claria Premium 273 Standard-capacity Color Multi-packcartridges good for 500 pages - check current prices and do the math); premium paper extra as for all photo printing.Among the things I look at in a printer are those things a unit does that other units don't. Depending on shopping around and what quality photo paper you want(standard, premium, ultrapremium and the finish), it runs us anywhere from 0.12-0.25cents/copy, but we're learning.Finally, how long will the machine last, and what about the upfront cost? Print quality is not stunning, just average. The quality of the printing is just great.I do have a few complaints, but these are more suggestions for what could be improved and do not change my high rating.1) It was tricky to get the phone jack in place. The Epson Expression Premium Photo XP-800 Small-in-One is no different; it offers fast, quiet, and quality prints, except on the draft setting which gives prints of such poor quality that text is unreadable. High quality transfer so that you almost can't tell the copy from the origional.2. Print quality is outstanding. Scan quality is average.Ink costs for the XP-800 are higher than I'm used to paying for a printer in this price range.

The quality is good enough to display and the colors look rich and true to the source.

While the text quality on the XP-800 is more than decent, I did notice that the characteristic Epson "look" was missing for the first time since the late 90's.4) Ink managementEpson ink seems a bit on the expensive side to me, and yet, the XP-800 cartridges are very competitively priced.
