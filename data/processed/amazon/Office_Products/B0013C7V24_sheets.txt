THese laminating sheets, not so much. The sheets are ever so slightly hazy, and trap air bubbles, no matter how much squeeze ou. When I needed some page-sized sheets, I thought I'd give 3M a try - afterall, 3M is known for their product quality and innovation.The sheet sized laminating sheets from 3M are impressive - they are quite easy to open to insert my page to be laminated and slide through the laminator quite easily. These laminating sheets work as advertised. That being said, I really didn't think these sheets - despite being made by the same company (Scotch Brand) - would be as good. These laminate sheets even withstood folding, which was very impressive. These sheets are basically big pieces of clear tape. So to do full sheets you only get enough in a packet to protect 5 pages which I thought could have been better priced for what is ultimately clear tape. These are great laminating sheets, but I discovered something the hard way. The sheets are clear and the items are easy to see once laminated and pressed. The sheets are about 3 mil in thickness. For these sheets, you need run over the item with a flat edge, like the rubber handles of a scissor, in order to get that tightly pressed finish. The sheets peel off and stick cleanly. After the laminate sheets arrived I promptly went through my wallet. I used some of these laminating sheets for identification cards. Second, the laminated sheets aren't as sturdy as they would be if you used a machine. The laminating sheets are quick and easy to use. I really enjoyed these laminating sheets. These laminating sheets are amazing. The sheets also have a glossy finish. It is very inexpensive, and the 10 single-sided laminating sheets in the package lets you laminate anything quickly and professionally. The Scotch laminating sheets worked like a charm. I saw "laminating sheets" and just blindly clicked because I was excited to be able to order something to use in my newScotch Thermal Laminator. The sheets are thick plastic, and resist scratches, tears and do not pucker. These laminating sheets are easy to use. The sheets cut easily with a good pair of scissors so trimming isn't particularly difficult. Well these do it yourself laminating sheets are just the answer. Ten large sheets can cover a lot of cards and projects. The sheets will protect your item from dirt and water, but not from bending or crumpling. I always keep laminating sheets on hand for various purposes, from printing out a photo on either copy paper or photo paper, laminating it and hanging it up on my kitchen cupboards, to laminating a list of people to call in case of emergency, and keeping it in my purse. These laminating sheets work ok but nothing like a higher quality, higher priced laminating sheet. I like to use laminating sheets to preserve leaves in the Fall and this product does the trick--heavy and sturdy. with these laminating sheets, they feel about the same as clear shipping tape, and I was worried they wouldn't hold up to everyday use.I use laminated tags with velcro tabs attached to the back in our shop to identify parts. I like that the sheets are cutomizable and come close to machine heat laminating. The self-sealing sheets have been great for infrequent use around the house, especially with kids projects. Finally some laminating sheets that you can actually use. Once both adhesive sheets are held together, I found it really hard to peel it apart!Overall, I do love the new way of laminating, less plastic and one less machine to throw into our environment. I will definitely make sure to keep several sheets handy for future use. The sheets come with measurements on the back that allow for easy cutting. The sheets stick together well but once together they don't move so you must do it right the first time. If you do mess the aligning up really badly and recognize it before the two sheets are about 1/2 way together and pull the sheet off it will take the ink off your document and the ink/typing will stick to the laminating sheet.I would only recommend if you need to laminate one or two things a year and the machine would take up unnecessary space in your house. These laminating sheets came in very handy when I came across my old Kindergarten promotion notice that I wanted to preserve. These laminate sheets are really great for laminating items you will only use for a couple of years due to their being so thin, but the best part is how they go on- so easily with no wrinkling or bubbles to smooth out. Laminating sheets.

I tried these sheets to preserve travel momentos (ticket stubs, business cards) in a single sheet, and also for photographs.The sheets are easy-peel (there's a removable strip at the top, so no hunting for a corner to peel), but it's harder when you apply the second sheet (the back).

Lining up the two sheets is difficult, and the sheets easily stick to each other.

The sheets are 9x12 inches in size and will accommodate paper up to 8.5x 11 inches.
