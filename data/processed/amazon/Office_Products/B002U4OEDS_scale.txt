This scale is surprisingly accurate. I also like how I can use the scale to measure the weight of a really light envelope, which came out to 3oz.You get your moneys worth with this scale, great investment if you're selling, or looking to sell online.Too long didn't read: Buy it. I have to hide this scale because it has become very popular in my office now. I have probably bought every scale Amazon had to offer and i simply gave up on this one!I was looking for something that would be portable, have a back light, you would not have to look from some kind of angle to see the reading and that would at least be able to weigh 0.02.Well at least for me that search came out dry!All these scales no matter the company/brand they are all the same and unfortunately i really needed one since i sell a lot on e-bay so i could not keep staying without a scale so i caved in and kept this one.Make sure you place the scale somewhere where you can move around so if you need to bend or move around to see the weight you can. This is just a great scale for our shipping room. This scale made it all easier. Really neat scale. I bought this scale and it's great. I bought this scale almost a year ago and have used it quite frequently since its purchase. I'm also careful with the scale:  I don't thunk stuff down on its surface; instead, I place my items down gently on the platform, as recommended in the instruction guide. It also means when I am not using the scale I can tuck it away quickly. I decided on this scale based on the fact that it could weigh in small units but could also weigh much heavier packages than other scales in the same price range. I had to replace my 50lb scale this winter and after a few tries, ended up with this model. You don't have to let the scale go back to zero in between each and every package. I needed a scale for packing items for my online stores. to set the scale to zero & begin weighing packages. I purchased this scale because it has the capicity to weigh up to 75lbs, it has a battery back up and a large top weigh area. I actually bought this scale because I was trying to get an accurate weight for our 2 Yorkies. Since it's a postal scale small weight increments are important, so we can be confident we know which weight category they're in. this is a very nice scale. Love this scale. I have owned this scale for almost a year now and haven't had a single problem with it. My scale was consistent and I haven't had any items returned for insufficient postage or anything.I like that you can plug it in or run it off battery.Very very pleased with this purchase. This scale is just what I needed - it's small, yet the capacity is more than I need for the price. This is a nice little scale.
