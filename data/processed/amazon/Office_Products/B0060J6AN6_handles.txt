The handles are a bit difficult to snap closed. But the handles are kind of loose, as in they wobble around even when snapped together, and the material of the box just isn't sturdy enough for me to feel comfortable sliding them in and out of a shelf repeatedly. The handles are especially well made as they include a two piece clip together cut out that enables you to carry the box without tearing the opening. The handles snapped into the holes cleanly, feel secure, and make the boxes comfortable to hold. The handles are a bit awkward to snap together and they don't seem needed. the handles on the ends are plastic reinforced. The handles work well, and taking into consideration that they are only plastic inserted into cardboard, they hold up well and are a great feature for carrying. They are sturdy and even have reinforced handles. I also love the smooth handles on the sides. The handles are reinforced with plastic frames.- Lightweight- Bins fold up when not in useCons- Made of cardboard. The handles make them easy to carry. The "handles" click together fairly well, but if you intend to store anything that would react with cardboard, this is not ideal. The black, plastic handles are nice and the see-through window gives the owner the benefit of knowing what's in the box without having to write on it.

I really like the handles - one piece of black plastic is inserted from each side and connect making a nice, smooth handle.

The handles and viewing window are a fantastic addition to the traditional storage box!I am moving, and trying to organize my stuff into a 900 foot square apartment.

The handles are made of strong plastic, and they fit perfectly in the handle holes.The flap that holds the "window" seems to be a bit long, but there is a perforated edge at the bottom that folds under so that it lays flat.
