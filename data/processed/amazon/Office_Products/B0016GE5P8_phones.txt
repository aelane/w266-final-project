The phones are sleek and unobtrusive. The phones themselves are lightweight and fit comfortably in my hand. I was particularly interested in these phones because they promised to deliver a much improved sound quality over the phones I already use. You'll enjoy using these phones! These phones provide crystal clear reception anywhere I roam throughout my house - even into the garage and out onto the driveway! Meaning that if you want both phones to have the same names and numbers in the phonebook you have to do both individually. My older phones automatically synced the information between both. However some may like this as you can have two phones with different information for a total of 100 names and numbers between the two.The phones have the ability of caller ID, and call waiting (if you get it from your phone company). !The phones also have an alarm clock, so that the phone will wake you at a certain time.You can expand the phones to have up to six phones!

I am generally used to phones with the TALK button in that exact spot, but these GE cordless phones have the TALK button in the center, with the speakerphone in the lower left corner of the top control region.

The phones appear aesthetically pleasing, with a futuristic look that would complement any home, office, dorm, or apartment environment.UPDATE:22 APR 2011The GE phone has given me some problems over the years.

We really wanted to love these phones, and for the first week or so, we did.
