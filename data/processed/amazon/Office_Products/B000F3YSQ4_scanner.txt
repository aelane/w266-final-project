While expensive, this is the scanner model that I assign to employees where I work. Very pleased with all the Scansnaps I have where I work.This is one scanner that really will help employees reduce the use of paper who aren't challenged to otherwise. This scanner is very small. This scanner is VERY easy to use. It is amazing how insanely fast this scanner is.3. If you are looking for a powerful scanner at a mid-range price it is great, and I definitely recommend it for anyone who does a lot of scanning to PDF. I have my old HP flatbed scanner for that stuff. The S500 scanner is quite intuitive to use, but the manual leaves no question about how to use it properly.The scanner opens somewhat like a flower. When closed back up the scanner's interior is completely covered, keeping it dust-free.The S500 scanner is very versatile. The scanner can be configured to send scanned documents to a variety of programs including Adobe Acrobat; Microsoft Word, Excel, or Powerpoint; Cardminder (a business card organizer that can route scanned business cards directly into Microsoft Outlook); ABBYY Finereader (an OCR software); and SnapScan Organizer (a .pdf organizer). The S500 is small enough that it could be easily used as a portable scanner. I have never seen such a fast scanner. My flatbed scanner clearly makes nicer image scans, although it takes much longer to produce them.Fujitsu's customer service is somewhat lacking. My scanner arrived with a corrupt SnapScan setup disk. The S500 is not the scanner to use if you want to scan primarily images or photos. The scanner is well worth its higher price. Please also note the Fujitsu S500 is a Windows-only scanner, so you will want to purchase the S500M model for usage with a Mac.
