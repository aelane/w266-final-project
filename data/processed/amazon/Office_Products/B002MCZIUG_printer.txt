Since the printer is wireless, I'm not using either the Ethernet cable or the USB cord. The printer is packed in a large cloth shopping bag that can be used for convenient grocery shopping. You then hook the printer up to your Wireless. Since the printer also works as a copy machine, it's nice to have what's essentially a color photocopy machine without needing to first scan a sheet into my computer, then send it to a color printer. prior to the printer job taking place.The fax works quickly and easily as well without requiring any input from you at your computer. HP has apps that allow the printer to take advantage of certain specific types of content (maps, illustrations, coupons, for example). The printer duty cycle is noted on HP's website as being up to 2500 pages for the printer and up to 1250 pages for the copier. After that, I mainly just want a reliable printer to do the tasks I mentioned earlier. When I went to install the printer on my laptop, it showed up on the network but Windows 7 did not have a driver so I had to install the drivers from HP's website. When I went back upstairs to check on the printer, the control panel had a message notifying me of 2 product updates so I allowed them to download and install. I'm guessing they did this so they could make the printer look nicer with their pretty HP graphic on the lid. The alert sounds that the printer makes are actually quite pleasing and not annoying at all. Overall, this is an excellent AIO printer and I recommend it. I used this printer to replace it's little brother, a C309g. This is an incredible printer from the folks at HP, my favorite printer company. The printer is easy to set up and use. This is one great printer! Also, the printer shakes my desk violently while printing, a minor annoyance.==VALUE FOR MONEY==While the features may warrant a high price tag for this excellent All-in-One printer, some consumers may find a better deal with a printer more targeted to their needs. My previous printer was theHP Photosmart C6380 All-in-One Printer. Why can't they just design a printer tray (for a non-commercial printer) that holds a ream of paper (500 pages)? And would you really put your printer far away from your computer? It does that on almost every printer I have ever used. This is probably the 30th HP printer I've either personally owned or was directly responsible for purchasing and supporting, and it appears they've outdone themselves on this one.Over the years, HP has put out some very nice units...and in contrast, some complete dogs, as well. The printer is wrapped in a big nylon bag with large straps, making it easy to remove. With the Touchsmart, I was able to wirelessly connect the printer to all of my computers.Setting up the printer was simple and it was able to find and connect to my wireless network easily. From there, you can tell Windows to install the printer from the CD and Windows will just install the drivers without the bloated software.I can overlook the bloated software though because I like this printer so much. This printer is an addition to the epson workforce 600 that I loveEpson WorkForce 600 Wireless All-in-One Printer (Black) (C11CA18201). this printer came with a free box of 100 sheets of 4x6 gloss photo paper and was packaged in one of those reusable shopping bags and had all the wires in another reusable zipper pouch. Overall this is a great printer, the touch screen is fantastic and is super easy to use and setup. HP Photosmart Premium printer is an awesome all-in-one printer (print, fax, scan, copy). This printer also has wireless, wi-fi, and bluetooth connection capability. Do it all with this printer (print, fax, scan, copy, web)3. Though this printer is not heavy, it's a bit big (bulky), so make sure you understand the dimension of this printer before you buySidarta Tanu
