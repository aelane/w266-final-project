so I was ok with it.I really liked these bags, they are the perfect size for small crafts, and it is wonderful that I could put my business info on the label with utter ease! I highly recommend these bags! The bags were really nice and good quality and the adhesive closure worked very well. It comes with 40 bags and the 40 label toppers that you customize. Also the bags are either too small or too big for what I was making (various jewelry, or sewn and knitted items). I love these bags and toppers. You have to fill the bags first and then seal them (self-adhesive strip on the bags), then attach the bags to the label, which becomes tricky, depending upon how bulky your bag is once filled. (The bags are a nice size, but they split at the seams if over-filled.) These bags cannot be used for food, so disappointing! The bags from this package look a lot better/more professional than a Ziploc baggie does, but the sticker page topper can look sloppy and unprofessional is not folded perfectly. These bags provide a fairly inexpensive way to professionally package a product. The bags really give the packages a nice look instead of simple plastic baggies.Overall, I'm very happy with this product and plan to use it again for Easter and other holidays. The bags are smallish and not intended to packaging larger objects. They have the bags with them as well as the labels- it was everything I needed.The bags were great, the labels attached to them well, and I felt that my end product looked quite professional. I used the bags to package a hand made card to give to a friend of mine. These bags with printable adhesive toppers now join my favorites list.I used 24 of the bags and toppers to put together small Christmas gifts for my nieces and nephews. Do not microwave bags." These bags and toppers are part fo a new line, "Avery Merchandising Solutions." The bags were easy to assemble and the results were professional looking. The bags are made of a thin plastic and measure 4 3/4" by 6 1/2". I wanted to use the bags to package sets of handmade notecards. The bags do not have a fold or anything to provide for "depth" in the bag. These bags are perfect for a large array of uses. These bags are also not food safe so any food or treat items must be pre-wrapped in food safe packaging before placing them in the bag but for non food items this is a perfect solution for packaging and presenting your items in a professional manner.T
