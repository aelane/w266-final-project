I aligned the printer head as part of the automated install and immediately turned out a very high quality 13X19 photo print. They are handy to move the printer forward from a storage position on your desk. I really like how the entire printer closes up to a sealed unit to cut down on dust in the printer.This is my third Canon printer and I am used to the ink cartridge system. Thankfully the printer is well packed but be sure!I wish all my recent purchases were as pleasing as this one. I hope to God the printer keeps printing well and doesn't break. The printer often ruins prints - especially 13x19 prints - by spewing tiny dots all over the photo, even with prevent paper abrasion enabled. I'm thrilled with this printer. I can't believe I have such a great printer at such an affordable price.I have a low-end Canon printer at home, another in my art studio and two others in my design classroom and I was searching for a Canon when I was researching large format printers. Right now, I'm using the printer to print images from a topographical map program. This will be my very last Canon Photo printer however, I still like their document printers just fine. Just setup my Canon Pro 9000 printer this PM and couldn't be happier.
