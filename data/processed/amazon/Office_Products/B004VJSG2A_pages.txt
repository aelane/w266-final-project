They certainly show up well among the pages of a book, however, I generally reuse my markers. Perfect for marking pages in books. On thin pages, I have to be careful when I take them off. I use them to mark pages in magazines and books. They stick well on the pages and could easily be moved from lesson to lesson as we progress through the text. They stick well to pages without damaging the paper or ink when you pull them off. They don't stick so tightly to the pages that they damage the book pages (you can tear them off easily and they leave no mark) yet they stay just firmly enough that you don't have to worry about them falling out. Now I don't have to fold the pages and I can see what the recipe is before I even open the book!My 3 yr old also loves the stickers to put on his potty chart. They never tore or otherwise damaged the pages they were used on. They may also tear or crease thin pages like you'd find inside a Bible or a Norton Anthology of literature, so be careful pulling them off if they've been on for a while. Because I change the pages I save, week by week, I go through these very quickly, so I need enough to last me a while at a good affordable cost. If you keep your pages clean, these can even be repositioned, but to a limit.I've got a music therapist friend who teaches piano to special needs children, and she told me that she LOVES these, and has gone through hundreds of packs of them over her years of teaching. They do not leave any residue on your pages, which is nice. These are great for marking pages as they stick, but remove without residue and without lifting text from the book pages! These are handy for marking pages and wide enough to jot a small note or reference comment. They are nice and sticky but don't damage the pages when removed.
