But the print quality was excellent.Printing from the tablet, however, has been a bit of a challenge. And, this is with both of the Epson print app's installed and registered.The big thing is printing wirelessly from the desktop and having a halfway decent print quality, which this XP-600 achieves. The Epson print definitely has more contrast and color saturation (although I don't know if the Shutterfly person played with that). The print quality is excellent for both photos and standard printing. The print quality is really nice, the colors are very crisp and relatively true-to-life. So when the black runs out quickly you get stuck with not being able to print.I do love that you can send print jobs from you e-mails. First, the print cartridges for this printer are unbelievably expensive. Yet when I checked the print levels I still had black ink showing,but the colors were gone. )The print quality is excellent for an inkjet nonetheless. It comes with 5 print cartridges which is nice and with my light office usage, they should last quite a while. It has the excellent print quality and simple operation you have come to expect from Epson printers. The print quality out of this printer is fantastic. The print quality itself is excellent, and photo quality is very good.
