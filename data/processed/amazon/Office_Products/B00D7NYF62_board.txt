This board comes with double-sided adhesive strips and magnet strips that you can put on the back to attach it to any surface... This board holds up well to repeated use. I've put this board on my refrigerator, to list items which are fresh and need to be used, so that I don't forget yet again about that zucchini that I got the other day.This is a lightweight white-board, backed by corrugated cardboard, and surrounded by a grayish plastic frame. This is a light board with an updated look - I like the frame which is a little different from the traditional white boards. The board on its own weighs around 9.6 oz.Combined with these new Ultra Fine Tip (UFT) markersLow-Odor Dry Erase Markers, Ultra-Fine Point, Assorted Colors, Set of 8that write much smaller than the standard Fine Tip markers, this board can be a great personal dry-erase board for brainstorming, organizing, planning, drawing and diagramming, especially in the landscape position. I fill the board up with small text and diagrams, take the picture in Evernote with the Document Camera and everything is readable in Evernote!Comparison: I had an older similar 11x14 magnetic dry erase board from Quartet (5 to 10 years older) and there are noticeable improvements. Love this little dry-erase board. This board magnetic dry-erase board is really nice. This board comes with one black dry-erase marker. But the Quartet board comes clean with just a swipe of the sponge eraser on the pen, a tissue, a paper towel, etc.I think dry erase boards are pretty &#34;plug and play&#34; and they are VERY appealing to kids (and obsessive list-makers, like myself) but this one is especially nice because of the styling and the fact it's also magnetic. So when I got this board, I was eager to see how it performed. This is a great white board, which includes 2 mini magnets to aid your presentations and a very handy erasable black marker with a nifty eraser on the bottom, which makes it easy to use just like a #2 pencil. This board was really easy to put up on the fridge with the magnets included. Very happy with this board. This white board is a great size for my fridge, or for the side of a filing cabinet.The magnets that keep it attached to a metal surface are very large and keep it where it belongs without any danger of slipping and sliding down the surface.It comes with decorative magnets for the front too and a marker with a cap that is magnetized on one side and has its own eraser on the other - very handy.I was going to keep it in my office at school but like it too much, so now it lives with me on my fridge where it helpfully reminds my son of his weekly chores. The board comes with mounting adhesive strips which I did not use since I use it more as a portable dry erase board, the marker it comes with is good, although I bought some multi-color fine tip dry erase markers that I use with this board as well. This board cleans off easily and I like the included magnets. Nice board. The board is magnetic so you can put things on it like the pen or other things. This dry-erase board makes the passive-aggressive notes a snap, and everyone can add their two cents! The board is fairly sturdy, although it's still backed by cardboard. The board also comes with two small circular magnets that can be used on the board itself to hang documents.Overall, the board is just the right size for our family to use. The board has a metal frame that looks nice, though it doesn't feel especially durable. I like that the board comes with its own magnetic dry erase pen (the cap has a magnet attached), but, again, the quality isn't particularly great. The board and marker work well. This board has a classic feel to it. I was hoping the board would hold onto my fridge with a better grip than the board it is replacing, but it's roughly the same. It's also less rigid than the board it's replacing, but that difference appears to be the result of designing a large board lightweight enough to hang on to a metal surface with not-incredibly-large-or-powerful magnets.Cons: Once you need to replace the pen that comes with the board, you will either have to find a pen that can use the same cap or you will have to find some other way to keep your new pen with the board; the board does not have any provision for holding onto a pen that doesn't have its own means of support.Bottom line: If an 11x14 board is what you need, this one is fine. The board comes with a small marker with magnetic cap and eraser, 2 hard circular magnetics, and 4 flexible rectangular magnets. The board itself is lightweight and it's very easy to clean off the marker. I received this Quartet Magnetic Dry-Erase board through the Amazon Vine Review program. For as long as I can recall, I've always kept a dry-erase board on my refrigerator for jotting down quick notes. This little 11&#34; x 14&#34; dry-erase board is framed with light plastic and has smooth, rounded edges. I've been looking for a dry-erase board to keep next to my laptop for doing quick, simple calculations and making short-term lists. That said, I'm very happy with the board. Not too small, but not too large, this is a Goldilocks-sized board that can hold a good sized list, without overtaking an entire area.It wipes off easily and comes with not only a black dry-erase marker that features a tiny, fairly useless, &#34;eraser,&#34; on the top, but also two magnets. This white board looks much better than the rest of the ones I own (and I have a lot of them). I liked that you can either stick this board onto a surface, or use the included magnets -- I chose the latter, which is not often available.
