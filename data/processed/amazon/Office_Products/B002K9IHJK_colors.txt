The bright colors are eye catching and I love the versatility of being able to remove and replace. Love the eye-catching colors of these labels. The bright colors makes a difference. The colors are vivid and stand out and you can remove them without leaving marks, tears, etc.There is a small tab at the bottom, or top if you wish, that does not have adhesive and makes it easy to remove the label without having to dig at it with your fingernail.All in all this is a really handy, workable, eye appealing product that appears to work as designed. If you can deal with the colors (fluorescent) and have a need for a label of this sort you have found the perfect product. The colors are bright and vivid, making it easy to see the label. The bright colors make the labels especially visible and easy to read, good for items you will be storing up and out of the way. I like the bright colors for labeling. The bright colors are an added bonus. They stick will, they are secure enough and won't fall off and the bright colors are nice as it keeps them visible. They come in colors that I really like and stick on myriad things. Plus the multiple colors allow basic visual coding into different catagories without having to read the label. These come in great colors,hard to ignore. I would like to see more colors offered in each pack. I have seen some other Post It Labels in more colors, which I think is better. I love the colors and use them to organize every from spices, files as well as boxed items. The colors are great. And, the bright colors really help make them stand out. The bright colors are nice, they enable you to categorize and color code. The bright colors of the labels make them easy to see and the adhesive is strong enough that they stay on, even in the freezer. The colors are all the neon colors and I am hoping they get muted colors soon. The bright colors are definitely eye-catching.My son is learning to read, so I've even used some of these labels to teach him new words like "frame," and the label stay put until we take it off.

These bright colors scream out and ensure that all potential readers take notice.An interesting feature of these stickies is that one border is devoid of stickiness.

There are 4 colors rather then just two and they have clean rounded edges for a much nicer finished look.
