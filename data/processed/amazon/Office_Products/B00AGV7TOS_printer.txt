I purchased this printer primarily because it is supposed to print CDs, but in this I have been disappointed. Unfortunately, the printer was dead on arrival. So the printer drivers appear to register the S/N of each printer into the registry before it can be used. I didn't check yet about sharing the printer and what the process is to do that.The Canon printing software is slow, but it works wonderfully to produce quality images. The printer is actually pretty fast after the initial routine it goes through to turn on. My last printer was a Canon MP560 and I had had it for almost 5 years when the print head overheated and the cost of repair was more than a new one, so I figured I would get this one. I only needed a printer that would print and scan, and this does both of those very well. I use this printer to print a lot of black and white documents but also to print color labels for wine that we make.Advantages:- Extremely clear print quality, even on standard.- Beautiful color images!- Scan capability- Duplex (2 sided printing) capability- Will print on various sized paper including 4x6 and will also print straight onto CDs!- Auto shut off - helps save power it will put itself to sleep after non-activity!- It comes in white! I still bought the black one but I thought the white was unique since almost every printer out there is black.Disadvantages:- Ink cost - my last printer had very cheap non-OEM ink available and I think because this is a newer model, the non-OEM ink is still expensive. I would buy this printer again if given the opportunity. This printer was rated highly. They sent a new printer head which did nothing. The printer does everything I want it to do for my home. I want a central printer where my family members can print to. But because the printer is located in a cabinet, I will live with it rather then endure the hassle of working with Amazon Customer service to swap them out ... Broken, loudest printer I have ever heard.A bit larger than I expected but seems sturdyCan't verify how long the ink will last since I just got it up and runningOver all the canon printer is what I wanted for picture quality which I give 5 stars, outside of the lag time on startup and the noise as the printer prepares to print its a very high end printer, I have to add I have not used the scanner but will add a review once I have.. Also I bought Sophia global ink which I will use once my factory ink goes dry  this I will also add in a updated review . I like this multi-purpose printer "Almost" as good as my last Canon PIXMA multi-purpose printer.

This is the first real printer I have had in a decade.
