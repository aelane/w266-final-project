These labels are easy to create using Avery's online templates. These labels made my final products look more professional and since some items were going into the freezer, I didn't mind using these labels for this purpose since they are water resistant. I like these labels and will use them for anything that will possibly get wet since I do believe they will withstand most liquids. These labels NEVER fed correctly. And yes, I even waited after the labels came out to be sure the ink was set. These labels are textured, arched, doesn't smear from water. Sometimes the labels I use peel and smear, but now I have these labels, so I don't have to worry about that, because these labels are especially designed for this. As soon as I saw these labels, I immediately thought about my old homebrewing hobby. With these labels, I see huge opportunities for really producing a custom crafted beer.Avery's online templates make it simple to produce basic labels. I tried it with these labels and was pleased to find it worked. These labels are somewhat expensive so I would not use these for every bottle in a batch, but would certainly add them to impress others.Overall, I like them a lot. You can't really say too much about labels in general, unless they get jammed in your printer or the ink runs. The labels have a rich texture that feels good to the touch and they take color printing well. I used these labels to create my own design for glass spice jars and storage containers to match my kitchen. If the labels are to be used this way (something that would be washed periodically) they need to have a clear topcoat to seal the label. These labels are marketed for small businesses, and they are perfect for the items I sell in my EBay business. I would recommend the these labels to any small business or charitable group. These are well made and sturdy arched white labels to be used on a laser printer. These arched, textured labels caught my eye because I like to can tomatoes and make salsa and juice. The labels are large with an arched top and come 9 to a sheet. I think these labels are terrific. These labels are just another great addition to their quality line.The texture of these labels is really what makes them stand out. The labels are great. I got these labels because they were the perfect size and shape to use on my book club paraphenilia (Water bottles, notebooks, etc.) The labels have a nice feel to them...they're not flimsy and so far I haven't had them smear on me. I'm glad that they made labels in this shape. Normally, I love using Avery labels, because the online instructions for printing and the templates are clear and concise. I received my Avery Textured Print-To-The-Edge Arched labels free from the Amazon Vine program, in exchange for writing a review.I'm a big fan of Avery labels and have used them for year as return address labels, box labels and hanging file folder labels. The labels are a nice size for either pint or quart jars, although they're a little smaller than a regular wine bottle label. I'm thrilled with these labels - just in time for decorating Christmas gifts. The labels look great just don't plan to use the avery template. These labels are very versatile and easy to use. It's not the labels' fault. The labels themselves are very attractive and have nice texture. I really like these labels. The labels stick well, but be sure to get placement right the first time, because you can't peel it off and start over. )The labels are too small for standard wine bottles. I suspect labels large enough to look well on a wine bottle would only fit four to a page--these are nine per page.The template loses a star here. I'm doing my own labels in Photoshop, which is a bit more time consuming.I don't know how well these labels will age, but if I notice problems over time I'll update my review. These labels are perfect for the small business that make their own anything. At first I wasn't sure if I liked the arched labels, but then I couldn't come up with any better shapes to make them in that would look as professional. Plus, with the labels coming in a pack of 90 it's plenty for the batches I make. Like my other labels, these are laser only. I used these Avery labels on my jars of homemade jam.

These are nice, but small, labels that are arched at the top and have a nice texture.
