I find it to be extremely fast in double sided printing, with very good paper handling and a quality print output. Plus it can do 2-sided printing, 8-1/2 x 11, & legal size printing. It really can do it all, especially that it now adds printing from mobile devices, which is a step up from just being Wireless! Single-sided printing was very quick, double-sided as well. After all this printing I have to say this printer is wonderful. It's double sided printing, scanning, faxing, and copying is just one feature in a long list of things that I thought I never needed, but quickly learned how much I missed out on.The ability to print from smartphones, multiple computers in the household, and using the touchscreen on the device itself make it really simple to utilize when needed; most importantly it's very comfortable and easy to use/learn. !It also has one of the fastest printing speeds. )The printing is TOP NOTCH. Epson likes to brag about its fast printing speeds and now I see why! Because it has Epson e-mail printing! * Remote printing directly to the printer - need to sign a document? Happy printing! While I haven't tested this scientifically, I can say that we're in heavy printing season right now at the end of the semester. You'll want to have the printing setting set on "quality," which is the highest possible, when printing photos. Photo printing always takes longer than document printing; that's just a fact of life. If you haven't enjoyed wireless printing before you're in for a treat! (If you need only fast, high-volume printing, rarely print photos, and already have a copier, you might consider a laser printer instead. Photo-printing and graphics-heavy printing is acceptable, but this wasn't designed to replace a dedicated pro-level printer for those kinds of tasks. Color printing looks very respectable, and the Epson handles color photos very nicely. I love the dual sided printing feature. The printing is double sided and quick and looks good.

Normal Mode is significantly better, but printing is still a bit ragged.

That makes me think that the poor printing in Economy Mode is in the software rather than the hardware.Other StuffIt has card reader slots on the front for just about every type of memory card...even the CF cards that are used in my old Nikon.

Epson's are always fast in printing and this model is too.
