I'm still shocked to say that I prefer these printed photos over the digital versions, but they are that good.Inkjet unit - Smooth print outs on multiple types of paper seems to be the hallmark of the 837. They looked very professional.I haven't used it for photos yet, so I will update this review once I have had a chance to do so. However, if you plan on printing photos and/or color documents, and especially if you want Wifi connectivity and plan on using this printer from multiple devices, this is the printer for you. I print occasional photos, but mainly use this for our home office needs. I will never have to send photos elsewhere to be developed but can do them at home assured of the result.I was pleased at the outset with the ease of set up. The Epson Artisan 837 creates great photos, has an abundance of features, and cheap ink which after years of using HP's multi fax/printer/scanner is a much needed relief. It was nice to print out photos quickly, but for larger jobs I'd consider using another service. I can't stress enough how great the photos look when printed on photo paper. However, after having tested it on some 4X6 photos it will instead become my primary photo printer as the results were breathtaking. The photos are just stunning and super easy to make. But if you rarely make your own photos, and instead are concerned about keeping the cost of ink refills low, then you may want to go with another Epson.Highly recommended. It even prints photos from our iPhones.
