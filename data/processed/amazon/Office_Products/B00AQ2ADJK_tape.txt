Aside from this tape being super strong, it does not go crazy when pulled off the roll.I use this to wrap boxes and the tape is very strong. It costs significantly more than other packing tape, and if you have time, you can always put two layers of tape (or, heck, three) on a box and still have it be cheaper than this. Not as robust as this tape, but it currently costs about one-third as much and it's very easy to use and also sufficient for most packing needs. This tape is both super strong and very flexible so it conforms to uneven surfaces, as necessary to stick properly. Or tape shut a box for storage? It is therefore almost impossible to tear.This is the perfect tape for wrapping boxes that you absolutely want to keep sealed, and which could otherwise rip open, due to weight, or bulkiness. This tape does the job. The tape edges don't curl up like some do so it stays put. I also believe that this is a great tape to keep around to repair a lot of things you have no other way of repairing. You can't just accidentally tear through this tape--you need to use a sharp blade on purpose to break the seal. This tape is strong and used for packaging bundles..  it features an easy to find edge and strong adhesive.Highly recommended for taping of any box. Good tape if you need to secure heavy packages. I usually double tape to add security on packages, but this felt really strong after just one band of tape down the center of the package. This tape fit perfectly on our dispenser and worked well for heavy packages. This tape is very competitive to the tape you see commercial companies use. I've used this tape to reinforce grommets in plastic sheeting and tarps, to securely tape packing boxes, and to bundle 2 x 4's, sections of pipe, and small sheets of glass used for craft work. Scotch tape - the best there is on earth - and this seals the deal. This tape will seal more than that.One of my favorite uses for this has been securing the bottoms of large cardboard moving boxes. Not just any tape will do the job: you must have this because people fail to realize this tape amounts to a rugged fiberglass filament net. That's why fiberglass-reinforced tape like this is a must. This tape is extremely strong, but cuts easily with scissors, and the adhesive is powerful. But this tape has filaments in both directions for added strength. This tape has a very good feel to it and I plan to use it exclusively going forward. This tape is really strong and has fibers going across and down which make it awesome for taping packages so that they won't come open. This is great packing tape. But they don't use filament tape on the job, so the few employees you steal can't reseal realistically (with the same tape used, so it doesn't look broken into), and filament tape is harder to quickly slice with a box cutter.All filament tape is not made alike. The two-inch wide tape would separate into two strips and no matter what I did, I couldn't stop the separation.So, Happy Reader's Packing Tape Rule #1:  Use only Scotch brand filament packing tape.And my new Rule #2: Only use Bi-directional filament tape. This tape is much more expensive, though, can't deny that.If you don't have a dispenser, I just bought a doozy on amazon that works perfectly with this 50 mm (about two inches) wide tape:Scotch Box Sealing Tape Dispenser H180, 2 in. Amazingly strong tape, fiber glass materials have been used to build air planes, cars and known to hold 5G forces. It is always good to have a super strong tape in the tool box, it will come handy when some thing big breaks. This is great tape if you are packing something and really need reinforcement. This is really beefy tape, and way more than you need for taping up most packages. The tape also doesn't appear to stretch at all. The tape will ensure that the cord is fastened securely against the wall for many years to come.Last night, I had eaten too much salty Chinese food and my fingers had swelled. I highly recommend purchasing this Scotch tape for holding your life together.Joseph B. Hoyos Normal strapping tape is stiff and less flexible than this tape. This tape is more expensive than other shipping tapes but it's in a special ultrastrength category. Great tape but not for applications which can be fulfilled by lighter tapes because of cost. This is superb tape. With this tape, I don't think I have anything to worry about. The tape is impossible to tear, which is the point, but you will need scissors to cut it. At least that is what Scotch claims, but I think I will stick to using clear packing tape to cover bar codes and addresses.The filament tape is intended for strapping, bundling, and reinforcing boxes for shipping, particularly if the contents are heavy. This tape has adhered to any surface I have tried it on. It rivals gorilla tape. This tape will not tear by hand, I tried, requires scissors. This tape is isn't transparent,but it is strong. This tape is different and much better than the standard tape of this type. The tape is difficult to cut. Perhaps my tape gun is just not as sharp as a new one, but it takes more effort to cut the tape. This tape is thick and the glass filament cross reinforcement resists tearing.Just like the prior reviewer mention, this is plain overkill for normal shipping. When the tape does accidentally stick to itself, it can be pulled apart with minimal impact to the adhesive.The adhesive has me a bit baffled though. I tried sticking the tape on my arm to test ability to stick on skin and hair. The tape minimally stuck, but came up with minimal fuss when I pulled it away. With a tape gun, I have to use a bit of extra effort to cut it with the serrated edges.While you cannot tear the tape in half or length-wise, it is possible to cut/shred the edges of the tape much like you would unraveling a knit project. The tape has "bi-directional filament" which is a fancy way of saying it has fiberglass threads running the length and width of the tape. Except, when I had to remove it, the tape put up a serious fight and then left a long strip of adhesive and fiber I now need to try to remove. "For the strongest, easiest to use and nearly indestructible filament tape, look no further. They probably don't use tape, but I didn't really want to go in the other direction and say, "Hey, if you plan on committing any home invasion robberies and want to tie up the home owners while you ransack their house..."  well, I guess I went there anyway.Really, folks, the strips of fabric filament in this tape makes it extra strong and will keep the bottoms of your boxes from falling out on you. This is not only super-strong filament tape; this is BI-DIRECTIONAL filament tape. This is the tape I'm using to make sure my boxes don't fall apart. This is the tape I got for that task.If you need the finest, strongest tape ever made, try a roll. This tape is, indeed, very strong. We used this Scotch Bi-Directional Filament tape not only to seal our heaviest packages, but to actually tape the heavy glass filled boxes to the wood pallets. I don't know of any tape strong enough that can do that. The tape was also used to keep pipes from banging- the pipe was wrapped in this tape and then fastened  to the wall. I didn't realize that I would ever need a tape this heavy for my own personal use, until one day when I took some boxes of books to sell at a local used book store. Having a tape around the house that can hold a box together that contains super heavy weight,  that can clamp wood together just like a vice grip and keep pipes from banging is much more than just a super strong tape, this tape can actually be used as a tool. I've used tape like this before and love the fact that it is extra strong, yet can be cut fairly easily with a knife or scissors. This tape is a monster: I don't know how much strecthing it can withstand, but I have not seen anything close to it! This is great tape. But for when a really strong tape is needed for mailing, this one will be great. This tape is great for boxes that you definitely want to have a good, solid, strong seal on. The tape fits a standard dispenser for roll tape. OK, so I realize this tape is expensive, but wow, does it ever work well. I am very, very impressed with this tape - you don't need a lot of it, and wowsers does it ever stick! It may just be me, but when using this tape this morning, the sticky side seems stickier than that of other tapes I have used.At the increased cost, this tape is not for just everyday shipping - but should be held back for those extra heavy boxes, where the weight might pop open other tapes as the boxes are bounced around in the shipping process.Everyone should have a roll of this tape available as an option when packing stuff for shipment - you won't use it every time, or even most times, but when you need really strong tape, this should be the roll you reach for.

Ok, this tape is awesome.

Sheepishly, I handed it over.Turns out that Scotch Bi-Directional tape can fix anything, except what Chuck Norris breaks.

Really very nice tape indeed!
