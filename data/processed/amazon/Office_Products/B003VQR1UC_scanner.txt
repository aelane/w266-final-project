This scanner could not be any easier to install and use. I've had this scanner for a few months now and it works great with my Mac! (I also have a Brother DS500, which is a wand-type portable scanner, but I use this Canoscan more often because of the ability to scan smaller pieces of paper.) My scanner is ready to go within literally about ten seconds of my plugging it into the USB port.Buy with confidence. If you just need a basic scanner for the office at a very reasonable price, I'd recommend the CanoScan. All I wanted was a scanner that didn't take up much space, was USB powered, well made and low priced. I have had this scanner for about a year. Since this scanner doesn't have a feeder the software allows you to add pages to your scans. Otherwise, this scanner is the perfect blend of features, simplicity, and value. What I love about this scanner is that its small, light weight and thin enough to place in a carry bag. this scanner works great this being my first scanner and never even used one before set up was very easy. I don't know all what this scanner can do yet since I just received it on 2/27/12 but so far I like it a lot. This small USB-powered flatbed scanner is an incredible value, and is portable enough to take on the road. I was recently looking to purchase a scanner for a family photo project in which I have to scan hundreds of images. In short, the scanner does not take all your desk space like in the old days. This scanner is ideal for value oriented shoppers.Don't bother buying an extended warranty (don't take it personally Square Trade) if your buy this scanner. This great little inexpensive scanner is no exception to the high standard of quality one can expect from this company. This is a great little scanner that takes up little space and provides moderately paced scans (not too fast, but not too slow either). This is a great scanner.

If you try to scan with the scanner locked, it will tell you, "unlock me".

Clean the scanner frequently with a damp cloth.

Although I still think HP's scanner software is the best, I think Canon does a reasonable good job and is not disadvantaged much.You can scan a document or a picture by simply pressing a button on the scanner, or you can twist the setting in the Canon MP Navigator EX software.
