This sharpener is fast, stops once sharp, and catches the shavings.Downsides? Normally with a sharpener you have to sharpen a little, pull it out and check if it's too sharp, aharpen a little more, check again...put it in too long and it over-sharpens and breaks off and you have to start all over again. With this sharpener it claims to have "tip saver technology" to prevent over sharpening...and it does!LOOKSIt's a nice looking sharpener as well, as far as sharpeners go. It's rather tall and doesn't fit nicely where my previous sharpener had been for years, on a short shelf, which worked perfectly with the side-entry sharpener, unlike this top-entry. The new sharpener showed up on time and it was pretty enough. I use the sharpener once a day before I draw my comic strip, and I only have to empty the shaving compartment every few weeks.Finally, it's a nice looking sharpener, sleek and modern.Get my point? I like this sharpener, and I think you will too. This looks solid and professional but it's not as good as an old electric sharpener I had as a kid which was heavy but solid. The Bostitch sharpener is an attractive, quiet, and supremely functional electric pencil sharpener. )Prior to using the Bostitch sharpener, I have always manually sharpened my pencils. (Original Review, April 2011)This sharpener is nice because it sits upright on the desk, which means it has a smaller footprint than some of the others on the market.
