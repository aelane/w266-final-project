They come off the wall in one piece. I did not use these on my wall. It did come off the wall cleanly, but took a layer of paper off the back off the postcard. The Scotch Reusable Tabs sounded great so I put one on my wall to see if it would stay. They are still sticking to the wall and I expect they will remain there.The tabs are definitely easily removable and leave no mark. I stuck them on my wall for several days during which time they held the piece of paper, a drawing 8 by 11 inches, firmly. I then reattached them to the wall and left them overnight. Admittedly, the wall was painted with builders-grade flat paint. Removing and peeling off from the wall presented no challenge either.I was curious about the claim about being able to wash the tabs with soap and water, yet having the tabs maintain their stickiness! Beyond the wall, I used a set to keep the docking station from shifting around on the desk while undocking. When I affixed it on a wall, it looked quite pleasant.
