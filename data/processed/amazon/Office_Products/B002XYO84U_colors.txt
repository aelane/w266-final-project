The assorted colors all to their usefulness. Pastel colors work for me. These are great colors and the fact that they are recycled makes them good for the environment, too. The colors are pastel and not as bright or vibrant as some other versions, but the fact they all are "green" makes me a lover of this product. The colors are pastel, and while I like the florescent colors better, pastel is a LOT better to write on. I especially like these because the colors are pretty and refreshing and they're from recycled paper. The colors are also nice - as long as you don't miss the bright yellow post-it note. LOVE IT!No, the colors aren't as nice as some of the other options (my fave is fuchsia), and as of this writing they don't come in "Super Sticky," but given the choice between giving  up the neons and helping save the planet (in a tiny way), I'm going with the latter.Post-it Greener Notes  are made from 100% (you read that right) recycled paper, and they use a plant-based adhesive, so you can stick 'em wherever you want and not feel guilty! The colors are muted and not flashy, nice for the office.A selection of six pads per pack, they fit in the desk holders.They have me hooked! The colors are soothing and bright at the same time; the notes come in shades of soft pink, baby blue, and a very subtle lime green. The colors make them so visible. They stick well, have nice colors and you can feel good about using a recyled product. These are pleasing colors, recyclable, made from recycled paper and plant-based adhesive. Online, the colors look a little more muted than they are in person. I like the colors as well.

Don't expect these to jump out at you with bright colors!

I honestly don't care about the colors much either way, but I thought I'd mention it as some people prefer brighter attention-grabbing colors.

The colors are attractive and they write on the same.The largest difference is that the adhesive is not as good as the standard ones.
