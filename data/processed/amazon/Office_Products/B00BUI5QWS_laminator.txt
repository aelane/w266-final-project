It comes with 2 laminator sheets and, unfortunately, no instructions (but instructions are available online: http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/A1DnkIZMgrS.pdf). As one might guess, the AmazonBasics laminator comes in a much smaller box, and it just so happens that it is a great box for storing the unit in a closet when not in use. I cannot say the same for the Scotch laminator, which comes in a large box that I do not want cluttering up my closet.- POUCH FEED (Advantage Scotch): The Scotch laminator has a pouch feed tray on top with width adjustment guides for the pouch. The AmazonBasics laminator has no such feed tray or guides. The Scotch laminator did seem to feed a bit more easily, though I didn't have any trouble with either unit.- OTHER FEATURES/SETTINGS/INDICATORS (Toss Up): Both laminators have a release lever that can be used in the event of a jam of some sort. That means I'd probably take the AmazonBasics laminator. This is my third thermal laminator, so I know my way around these things.Or, I thought I did.First up: this one doesn't require the use of a sleeve. Every other thermal laminator I've used requires the use of a protective sleeve (like a manila folder) to keep the plastic material from adhering to the hot rollers. But if you've never used a laminator before, be sure to read up. Would recommend for your basic thermal laminator. This laminator works very well - takes the normal few minutes to warm up and then seals nicely. I love this laminator. I'd put this against any laminator at 4x the price any day.I also recommend use with theAmazonBasics Thermal Laminating Pouches, 8.9 x 11.4 Inches, 100-Packwhich themselves seem like very good value and work quite well. The only laminator I've used before getting this one is the big one at work. The AmazonBasics laminator is inexpensive, compact, easy to use, easy to store, and works just fine. first laminator I've owned, so it takes a while to warm up, I'm sure that's normal. This is a great laminator for small jobs. This laminator does exactly what it is supposed to do-laminate paper and photos without a fuss. As a laminator, it works okay, but the lack of instructions really had me wonder how it all works, but it was pretty self-explanatory.
