For those that refill with ink, the catridge is resettable with a resetter. the ink itself seem a bit thinner than the canon ink and so can smudge on photo paper (so print slower) and is not as color fast or fade resistant ( I have a picture that faded withen a week when left in on my desk which gets sun 6 hours a day, basic water test on the ink yielded running  even with light blotting) So bottom line for basic printing they are excellent but for photo printing go with original manufacture's ink They either dry up quickly, the ink runs out or just stop working. I've been using compatible ink cartridges for a about a year and so far I have had no problems. As far of the ink quality, I have not seen a major difference in comparison with Canon's. I'm happy to get such good ink cartridges for such a low price. I may sometimes get a little ink on my fingers, but this is not much of a problem, and is infrequent. I was intending to use this ink for general purpose prints only, which it does just as well as factory ink, but then I thought I'd try a photo...I was really impressed by how good the ink looks. I had black ink (from the larger black cartridge) drip on my table and on my keyboard. Just watch the dripping ink! I started getting generic black ink, and it worked, so I bought this very inexpensive 12 pack.If you just do normal here and there printing, mostly black with some color this or that, they are fine. While I knew it'd hurt to get replacement ink cartridges, I didn't realize how much it would hurt.
