I am sorry!7/28/10:The phone has died. Pretty phone, crappy construction. The phone has plenty of ring tones to choose from and is quite loud. If you use ever used a Blackberry Pearl phone before, this is what it feels like, just a tad longer.I like the design and feel it adds a bit of touch to the decor of the house. I would highly recommend this phone if you are in the market for one.Edit August 23, 2011:  It's been a few months since I posted my review, and now and the phone suddenly has a ton of static on both ends. This phone is marketed by Phliips as the "Design Collection". The phone color has a black shine type finish to it. The phone is quite intuitive to use. I was able to use this phone with good quality through 2 floors and probably 80 feet from the base unit without an issue. Even after a fully charged phone is used, I can only seem to get 45 minutes of talk-time before the phone reminds me that it needs a charge. I was immediately surprised at just how small the phone is. The phone, too, is very thin, very small and seems to be aping the style of some cell phones I've used through the years.

I found the phone slipping out of my hand a few times.I can remember those big boxy looking answering machines that hung on the wall that seemed to weigh a ton!

Original Review (really liked this phone at the beginning):This Philips ID555 cordless answering machine phone is DECT 6.0 and comes from the Philips' Design Collection.

The phone comes with a quick start guide and a regular user manual (separate manuals/guides in English, French & Spanish).My only complaint is that I couldn't find an extension handset anywhere even though it looks like the phone has been out for awhile.
