Overall I do not regret buying this printer and Brother has earned my business in the future. Very good printer, especially for its price (WAS under $100 at Amazon). I had a Canon printer before, and despite using Canon brand ink cartridges, it quit after 2 years. This printer can be kept in ink and for far less than its competitors. It was also pretty easy to install this printer. I bought this printer about a month ago but haven't hooked it up yet because my old Epson R200 is still hanging in there after about 10 years. I bought the Brother because I wanted an all-in-one printer that used affordable ink. I will review the Brother printer when we get it hooked up and working.The Epson died so we hooked this up today and so far I love it! Remember, my last printer was 10 years old so this is all new hi-tech for me. Very happy with this printer! I wanted an inexpensive printer to use when I am at my second home. This printer fills my requirements perfectly. The Brother printer is so quick and easy to set up. I had this printer configured on my wireless network and running in just a few minutes. I highly recommend this printer over any Canon or equal or near equal cost.
