The binder constructed of hard plastic and you have an inside pocket, however, the plastic pocket is not durable, therefore you can see it will tear soon. Each binder can hold only so many inserts, unlike a 3-ring binder of the same width. This is a specialized binder, in my opinion. However, the 2-1/2" binder will only hold 8 inserts, so you won't be able to "manage" much.CONS:1. The Pendaflex Starter Kit either includes a binder with the capacity for 4 inserts or 8 (one of the 4-insert binders comes in "Leatherette" while the two others are made of a hard plastic-like Durable or Flex Poly).The 8-insert version comes with a somewhat flimsy clipboard, 2 secure file folders that stay closed with elastic cords that stretch across two corners and a lip on one edge for labeling; an expandable top-loading envelope insert which closes with elastic cord wrapped around 2 clear plastic buttons and a media file that can hold 2 cd or dvds and has two smaller pockets with flap tops. The entire binder is held closed with elastic string strung from the back to wrap around a raised oval "Pendaflex" button. A strong, durable, multi-function binder that can store CD/DVD, papers, and include the ability to add functionality with items such as a clipboard. This binder can hold up to 8 organizational tools, and came with 5:1) a 4 pocket media file (sized for cd storage and transportation)2) an envelope (8.5 x 11)with a secure toggle closure3 &4) 2 secure file folders (folders which can be kept closed with an elastic loop)5) a removable hard plastic clip boardIn addition to the included items, Pendaflex offers traditional twin pocket dividers, a "display book" (removable album), a "project pocket," an envelope which opens lengthwise, and single pocket dividers.The binder itself is sturdy, and th4 insert system innovative, but I am not sure I like it as well as traditional 3 ring binders. While the binder itself is sturdy, it is not terribly flexible. I've found this binder to be a easy way to store various types of documents and media associated with my work and have it neatly organized and protected in one binder. Also, the binder is rather plain looking and bulky.The inserts were very easy to install and the closure works well to keep the binder closed.If you have a need for something like this, it might be the perfect product for you. I just personally wish that it was available in slightly smaller binder size. Unlike the traditional 3-hole binder, the Pendaflex has slots that lock, where you place or slip in the inserts, once its placed, just hit the locks and snap, your files are already in place with the binder. It keeps my desk clean and lets me throw one binder into a messenger bag instead of multiple folders. It's a rather flimsy binder, and the filing pages aren't much better. The binder itself has a removable label on its spine so you can identify the contents, especially if you use more than one,  and an elastic band that wraps around the open end and goes around a slotted, raised button on the front. This set-up allows the binder to expand as contents increase. The binder closes with an elastic cord that handily slips over a front button.I Organize claims to be designed by you; they even asks for feedback to make the product better, and it comes with customizable filing tools to fit your individual needs. The black essential binder has 4 channels for files and folders; the storage binder has eight channels. I always take in a binder that is specifically designed for that presentation, which I would guess is what this binder could be best used for. Any binder could provide those things, and the "snap in" locking system is just annoying, not particularly helpful at all. I use this binder mainly to hold together a bunch of miscellaneous documents - some hole-punched, some not, some torn sheets, etc - they all hold together neatly in the included secure file folder. You can't use the binder to carry things unless you buy the special inserts, which can get pricey.

The binder is flimsy to me.

The binder is packed inside out, and it took a second or two before I realized I had to flip it around.The premise of the system is simple - there's a thick plastic binder with eight slots on the inside of the spine, and a bunch of different inserts that can be put into the slots, and locked in place.Overall, almost everything is very well designed.

For a two-inch binder, that doesn't cut it for me.
