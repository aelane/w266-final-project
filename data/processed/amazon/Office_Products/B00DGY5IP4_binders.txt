These are perfect sized binders for storing an assortment of papers I use for my research. I'm using these binders to organize my class notes for several online courses. These are your basic binders, and work well for my needs. I love these binders and must have about 2 dozen of them at my office and another dozen at home. These binders are typical ring binders with window sleeves. The Wilson binders are billed as view binders so the central question of any binder review is did they protect my paperwork from the elements and allow me to view them without complications? These binders are just the right size to keep these print outs in. Solid binders that have worked well, in a 4 pack. What's not to like about 3-ring binders? I much prefer multiple binders for each purpose than one large binder.Personally, I store receipts in one binder. If you're looking for inexpensive, basic white binders, then these may be perfect for you. I like to use three-ring binders to store materials for my various work projects, and these binders work well for that purpose. Thus, you can label or decorate your binders in any way you'd like. They are binders.
