It is perfect for gift wrapping, such as it was intended.But you can use it for whatever you want.It looks so delicate and smooth.With the holidays coming up, this tape is perfect for wrapping.Looks aside, this tape does its job. After wrapping, it is also clear that the gift wrap tape was less cloudy and did indeed look better than the present wrapped in regular tape. It's virtually undetectable on shiny gift wrap. I would definitely buy Scotch gift wrap tape again, though I don't expect it to change my life. Does what it is marketed for, not showing up on gift wrap. Get both scotch gift tape and scotch regualr tape and you will have the right tape for the right occasion. But when giving a gift to someone other than my own family, looks do mean a lot. Well, after using this gift wrapping finish tape, I don't think I will be going back to standard tape. It just makes the gift look more pleasing. This gift wrap tape actually becomes invisable on the package and lets your gift wrap show through. It doesn't cost much more to make your gift wrapping look really professional. Right here around the Holiday Season gift wrapping is certainly something we're doing a lot of so a set of three rolls of tape comes in very handy. Most commercial gift wrap has a sheen as we all know. However it was still noticable on gift wrap as the paper had more sheen than the tape----and now, we have a solution to this heart wrenching problem. This new gift wrapping tape and the Scotch brand magic transparent tape I have been using for years are very similar. The gift wrap tape sealed all the package to the point where many receivers could not locate what was holding their presents together. You buy a nice gift and you want to wrap it for that special person to whom you are going to give it. You found the perfect gift wrap paper, cut the paper perfectly and fold every crease to perfection. When you are wrapping a gift -- with wrapping paper that folds just so, without little crinkles -- when you are wrapping a gift you want the smooth lover's touch of satin against your fingers, a shiny surface that light will caress into a soft shine. Once you put this on the gift wrap you aren't getting it off without damaging the paper unless you're using the fancier foil wraps. I also love that the gift wrap tape is clear when you place in onto the wrapping paper. It disappears on gift wrap paper that doesn't have a super glossy finish. Almost every gift wrap that you'll find in stores will have a finish that works well with Scotch Gift Wrap Tape.The convenient three pack has plenty of tape for a pampered child's birthday or for three of Santa's elves to wrap a reindeer load of gifts. Love the gift wrap tape! It disappears onto semi-glossy to glossy gift wrap paper, but it's got a slight sheen that will catch light on school projects. I know that 3M means the wrapped gift, but honestly, nothing makes a wrapped gift for me look that good. Scotch gift wrap tape is my new preferred tape for wrapping gifts (have to get started on that early so that it doesn't put me in the poor house). It is transparent on gift wrap yet has a nice solid bond that keeps your gifts tightly bundled, even for someone as terrible at wrapping gifts as I am.One point that few have pointed out is that the gift wrap tape also breaks fairly easily with pressure, which I find to be a good thing. This is easily the best gift wrapping tape I have ever used. Works great for gift wrapping. It's a little tougher than the the gift wrap tape of yesteryear so you think this is going to be just like the cheap stuff. The gift wrap tape I used in the past was easy to tear and flimsy. This new gift wrap version seems to hold even better than our old standby and pretty much disappears on any matte finish gift wrap. This gift wrap tape keeps the streak alive. It's specifically intended for gift wrap, and the "satin" finish matches very closely to the finish on most of my wrapping papers, making it much less jarring and obvious when the present is all taped up and ready to go. This gift wrap tape avoids that problem.Also, over the years, I've tried various "generic" tape...and it all has been uniformly bad. When the gift wrap tape arrived, I compared it by adding a piece next to the regular tape. The gift tape is nearly invisible, whereas the other is cloudier and more apparent. First off-- for gift wrapping and taping things where you want the tape to disappear, this is the right product for you. It is difficult for me to get too excited about gift wrapping tape--probably because my wife does all the gift wrapping (unlike me, she is really good at it), and also because when I get a wrapped gift the last thing I look at it is to see what kind of tape was used. Apparently, it's ideal for gift wrapping, but inasmuch as wrapping paper and I are sworn enemies, I doubt the quality of my tape will be the first thought in my family's heads. Scotch gift wrapping tape is wonderful. Now I am on with the gift wrapping for the holidays. Yes, it disappears on gift wrapped surfaces. For gift wrapping & other instances where you'd like tape to not be so visible, this stuff is great! This gift wrap tape is similar to their standard satin finished tape and is designed to blend into the wrapping paper.
