These boxes are nice, lightweight, easy to use. Storing is easy, stackable boxes. These are "medium-duty" boxes, so they aren't super thick or double walled. These are nice, but they're more like $4 boxes, IMO. These boxes are sturdy, and, even better, they are super easy to set up. There are four (4) boxes in this selection; each white cardboard box is 10  by 12 by 24.5 inches with handhold slots and black grips at each end for carefree lifting. These boxes proved - with their easy assembly, sturdy construction, and near closure methods - best for correspondence, files, and books; while the companion boxes with their removable lid proved a better bet for my wide variety of various and sundry sized items that need storing.Assembly was unbelievably easy. These are large boxes that are quite sturdy, and stacking strength seems a little better than average. You can easily stack boxes on top of each other without distorting them. These boxes are just what I need for my old files for long term storage. The boxes come flat as most do, but these open and assemble in one fluid motion. The boxes themselves are sturdy, with each one weighing 1 pound, 10.9 ounces.Yes, I love Fellowes . I was able to put together one of the four boxes in this pack within 5 minutes - just pop out, fold over the sides just a bit and there you have your box! I highly recommend these boxes.
