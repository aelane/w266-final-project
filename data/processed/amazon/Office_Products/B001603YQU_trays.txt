Got the trays in a nice and compact box about as tall as just two of the trays. agree the top trays are poor design for a full ream of paper. It's got six trays and the plastic they're made of isn't that super brittle junk that breaks and falls apart, but it isn't the softer, more resilient plastic that Rubbermaid containers are made of either. These 6 trays come in a very small box, and snap together easily. If the missing 5 trays were included It would have been ideal. Overall these are some nice trays; they are made of plastic but are much more durable and ridged. Mostly I use these trays for temporary organization or sorting of documents or letters that I later file into drawers. These aren't the expensive trays. These trays are for nice light storage, they work with the metal rack I bought, or by themselves. I like how the trays stack inside each other for shipping (and in my case, moving). These trays are nice to place on a office desk.
