If hung on the wall, you really need two hooks to keep it straight. It can be hung on a wall (try Command hooks to not damage the wall surface) for space saving, so that all folders are easily visible and accessible. The wall organizer is very colorful and cheery. It hangs perfectly on the wall on the towel hook and is off the floor and flat against the wall. This cascading wall organizer is perfect for stashing frequently used items in my classroom. This wall organizer has right colors, holds a fair amount of stuff, and is light enough to hang with a command hanger. I got this wall organizer, hung it in a space between two bookcases, and now I can have six small &#34;stacks&#34; of paper that are actually organized! Just leave them on the wall and continue to use them.Bottom line: a well-designed space saving file system for modest amounts of paperwork. This vertical wall organizer has been fantastic. It looks nice on the wall by my desk and the colored poly pockets look nice and make it easy to keep different material separated. I have removed it from my wall and taken it to meetings a couple of times. This cascading vertical wall organizer is great for organizing standard letter-size or smaller pieces of paper. Because it rests flat against a wall or a door, it doesn't take up a lot of space. We&#8217;ve hung this wall organizer in the kitchen, and given each of our three (as well as ourselves) one folder, where we put &#8220;to do&#8217;s&#8221;, reminders, completed homework, etc., into the correct folder.
