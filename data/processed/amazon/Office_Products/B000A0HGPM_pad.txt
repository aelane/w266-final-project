I was able to use it a little longer but eventually had to go back to my old pad (which is much more comfortable). This pad replaced my old conventional pad and I prefer this one because of the firm yet soft pad and because it is a comfortable height (about an inch).The hard part of the pad for the mouse is supposed to preserve battery life. The pad arrived on that day and I found it really comfortable to use. The wrist pad provides the perfect amount of support and the gel is comfortable without being too mushy. We are going to keep it and use it however we'll keep the pad on the desk so my husband can use it when he wants and we didn't install any of the tilt cushions so it just sits flat. Personally, I find it easier and more ergonomically sound to use a pad that's flat on my desk, so I haven't utilized the bumpers. The pad itself is perfect for today's laser mice. I haven't tried tilting the pad, but the nubs included for such seem like they'd do a good job - I just don't get why you'd want to tilt the pad. However, you may remove and reposition the pad at anytime. I wish the pad was just a little softer, but the support is good.Antimicrobial is very good for an office - especially if you eat at your desk. You've got the actual pad itself, the wrist pad that you stick on (with sticky tape and some kind of velcro) and then the little knobs to put on the bottom of the pad to create the tilted angle.
