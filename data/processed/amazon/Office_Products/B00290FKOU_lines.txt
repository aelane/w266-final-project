It has very nice strong lines and she found it very helpful. The blue vertical lines are unobtrusive, but the red and green lines for the margins are bold and bright. The lines are nicely spaced and the little dividers makes the child work on letter spacing and neatness. The lines also help control letter size, which my son has alot of issues with. The light blue half-size vertical lines help him to properly size his letters. The upright lines only reach half-height of the line space. She complained only that the blue vertical lines were "too bright." It has lines on where to start your sentence, and a stop sign for where to stop. She thought she would have to re-write several lines of text in order to get the spacing right for everything! The little lines that mark the spaces for letters are also great because they train young writers to keep their letters neat and just the right size - not overly large or tiny.

The lines are 1 centimeter apart; with the vertical letter lines (which I've called hash marks) being 6.5 cm, or 1/4 inches apart.

They need simple lines pages.I do think it's perfect for simple addition and subtraction problems.

Eventually he would just used to the lines guiding him and be lost without them.
