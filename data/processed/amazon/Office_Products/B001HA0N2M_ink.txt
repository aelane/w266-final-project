I did find that these started to dry out sooner than I am used to, possibly because they require more ink to produce more vibrant color, but I have been enjoying using them nonetheless. I also like the ink indicator on the side. I haven't used it long enough for the ink to run out, but I do like that I'll be able to see through the outside cover to see if it's running low. The ink flows very nicely and leaves a very solid line. The ink seems like liquid even though it is dry erase. Once dry the ink erases easily and completely, with no dust or particles. The ink is pressurized, and I'm now getting a large, wet blob as I write which I can watch spreading out into a large, round mark rather than letters or numbers. Also, the ink reservoir is visible, so you know when you need to replace the pen. The ink is easily erased from the white board using the fuzzy white board eraser. The ink in these flows smoothly with consistent color. The ink is more consistent than expo, and doesn't dry out nearly as fast. You can see how much ink is in the marker through a window on the side. The ink completely wipes clean from our eraser boards even when left to dry overnight or longer (yes, it is a bit harder to wipe the ink off when it's dried for many hours however a damp napkin removes the dried ink in seconds).Although some other reviews suggested their markers leaked, I've used at least 3 sets of these markers and NONE of them have leaked which I find especially impressive considering the pounding they get from my kids. Because of the ink's watered down look, these don't write as solidly as your average dry erase markers that have just been opened (you know before they start to dry out and leave streaks). Lastly, the ink stands out boldly on the board and it doesn't disintegrate into dust when you erase it. I love that the ink flows smoothly every time and doesn't get globby after a while and you can see exactly how much ink is left thanks to the see through ink chamber. Being able to see how much ink is left in each marker is a helpful feature, especially when relying on them regularly for projects. I also like that I can see how much ink is left because they can go from fine to empty in no time flat. Since they write in fine ink, it won't be easy to see them from a distance.They do not have a nasty odor like other dry erase markers, and the roll-proof cap is an added bonus. The ink erases easily without any ghosting. The ink level indicator is a nice and helpful perk as well. The ink is not like normal dry erase markers whatsoever, and it is simply not true that these markers produce &#34;strong, bold color.&#34;The other claimed benefits - such as caps that prevent rolling, and a visible ink well - did not matter to me as I could not see clearly what I had written. The ink flows very smoothly and consistently.
