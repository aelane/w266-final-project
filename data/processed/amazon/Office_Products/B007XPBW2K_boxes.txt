I've been professionally moved, and these definitely hold their own against the boxes used by the pros. These are great moving boxes and provide much better damage protection for your belongings than the typical thin shipping box. I wouldn't advise loading the boxes up with many, small, heavy items like linens or books if you are moving them yourself, as those items are probably best left to the "small"-size boxes. If you are moving these boxes yourself, I found they are handy for packing items like the kitchen mixer, food processor, as well as cast-iron pots and pans. These are excellent boxes for everything. I have used these boxes in a recent cross country move and they survived exceptionally well. Similar boxes fro the national self move chain fared much worse - I have no complains about this set of boxes - I am very pleased with their performance. I used these boxes for 2 things-first when I was painting my office and needed to remove everything from the room and packing glass items that I had in my fruit cellar. These boxes arrived, well packed, in a box. Comparatively, these boxes are about average. I wish the boxes shipped in a better container. If boxes were burgers then this these would be the Big Mac.The Bankers Box Smooth Move Dish Boxes have serious rigidity, with the ability to hold up with a full capacity of contents. These boxes stack nicely as foundation boxes that I need not worry about getting crunched, they're that strong.The price seems quite reasonable considering their capacity, and four huge, strong boxes go a long way. These boxes are very well made with the exception of the flaps not aligning when the box is folded. These boxes are well made but super large - Banker's Boxes are always top quality in my book!As American society ages, more people will be prone to use more manageable sized boxes or rely on someone else to assist them in moving tasks. The boxes each hold about ten full place settings of china (when properly packaged in packing paper). The boxes will also fit most table lamps, but are probably overkill. Do not skimp on boxes, especially if you are moving long distance like I am. You need real moving boxes, not ones that the grocery stores might donate to you. It is not like other dish boxes that come with inserts & foam wrapping. I recently moved and these boxes were perfect. I am completely disappointed in these boxes. Large boxes for packing stuff away. The boxes are sturdily constructed, built to protect the contents, and easy to assemble. I'll be moving soon and found that these large, strong boxes are perfect for moving small kitchen appliances. Simply great boxes! These dish boxes were ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!I found they are also perfect for lamps. These are absolutely great boxes for moving! I would definitely recommend these boxes for your next move or storage needs! If you are moving, there is only so much you can do with the typical file-sized boxes that are designed to hold paper files. These boxes are not cheap, but once you start using them, you'll be glad you purchased them. These are nice and efficient moving boxes. It's pretty obvious that there's not much to say about boxes! I really don't think you can find better boxes for storage, moving or shipping than the ones offered by Bankers Box and we have moved a lot! These boxes are made of strong and high-quality material.

I bought these boxes to ship some fragile items.

They are wonderfully strong, sturdy boxes.

These are great boxes for anything you want to pack to move that you would like to have extra protection.
