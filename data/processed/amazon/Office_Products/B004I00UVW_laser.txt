This pen-shaped laser pointer and remote works fantastic for presentations. One for the laser pointer, a forward for advancing slides and a reverse for going backwards.The laser is pretty powerful and projects quite a distance, although the brightness of the room will have an impact on how far away you can be. It's easy to push the laser button by mistake, and there's no blank screen button. The laser pointer is good and comes in handy. I had never used a laser pointer before and I needed to give some classes at work. But that's probably all the laser pointers, not just this one. This would not work well for that, the laser part would be OK, but the remote page changer would cause you to go closer to get it to work sometimes. As far as the laser pointer function goes it works great. The laser beam is similar to the last laser pointer that I used. As far as the laser pointer function goes it works very well. The Quartet remote laser pointer is a thoughtfully designed tool for presentations in small venues. It is less powerful than the average laser so that if you turn while speaking and accidentally cross paths with someone's eyes you do not cause any harm. A very nice laser pointer, solid build quality and durability. The red laser looks great on a wall or a projection screen, looks more faded on TV/LED screens.Highly recommended for business and professional use.NOTE: the USB feature did not work with my Macbook Pro. The laser for pointing and the 'up' and 'down' buttons for controlling the display make it very easy to move about while talking as this is a wireless device.I am pleased with its performance and find it very useful. As a laser pointer it is fine. the laser itself  was a bit disappointing in that it showed on white walls without any problems but was not visible on  a white background on the monitor. So now I just have a very elaborate laser pointer. If you are looking at this, you either need a laser pointer, a presentation wireless remote, or both. One is for the laser pointer.
