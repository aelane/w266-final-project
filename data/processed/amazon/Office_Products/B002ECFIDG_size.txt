The size of this pad (about 3" square for 3 labels) is easy to store in your drawer or filing cabinet. If a larger size is available, that's the one I personally would buy.Bear in mind that these labels are designed to be easily removable. Because they are about the right size, I tried using them to label spice jars. These however are perfect, the size is nice and though they really stay stuck in a book they also pull off cleanly w/o any residue. I especially like the 1 X 3 size. That size works best for me by permitting larger symbols (letters, numbers etc.) I love the compact size -- perfect for a line or two -- and they really do stick pretty well when you peel them off and restick them.The colors are brighter (almost neon) compared to what shows on the Amazon page, but that could just be my monitor. The size is very useful for the purpose.I don't see any difference between these and 3M Post-its in regard to how roller-ball pens or Sharpie markers write on them. They are also  a good size for file folder tab labels. This is a great handy size and I LOVE that they are removable. A decent size that covers the average labeling task.3. They're the size of one label, so you can easily carry them around with you.--Disadvantages: Cannot feed them into printer, slightly more expensive per label (going by prices posted today on Amazon)*Avery Removable 1 x 2 5/8 Inch White ID Labels 750 Count (6460)--Advantages: Can be fed into printer, slightly lower cost per label--Disadvantages: Comes only in white, annoying to carry a sheet of labels if you're going around labeling things in your house, because the sheet tends to get wrinkled.Either format, this is a great product!Disclosure: I received one pad of labels for free, but I was not paid for this review. They are a small size, at 1"x3", that could be useful for tiny notes, but not really for long-term labeling. I really like the size of the label and they really do stick andunpeel without leaving a residue. It is a perfect size to write a detailed caption when you don't want either too little or too much text. A better adhesive and size would make these labels a great product for those of us that have a use for a post-it type label.
