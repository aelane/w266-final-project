There's enough tape in this 3-pack for several projects. The tape attaches itself well to paper or cardboard but the advertized ability to write on it may be a little overstated. I picked this tape to use as a fun accent in the place of regular tape when the tape isn't extremely important as a mega-adhesive. It is like regular tape but much funner. The Scotch Expressions Magic tape I received is as pictured: three rolls in green, blue and a tribal print. If you wish to use this tape for labeling purposes, you'll need to stick with a ball point pen, which I don't think looks as nice if you're trying to add a decorative touch. Like most washi tape, the scotch expresssions tape is easy to remove without damaging most surfaces and will still retain some 'sticking' power if reapplied. This tape has a matte finish and is slightly translucent. You can easily tear the tape with your fingers but it won't give you a straight edge. The tape is about as thick and durable as regular scotch tape. This tape has the same adhesive strength of regular scotch tape. I would recommend using it in a tape dispenser, it just makes it easier to use that way. The tape really made the package stand out and look much better than it would have with regular scotch tape. My Scotch Expression magic tape arrived just as I was taking a day to create birthday cards for some men in my life. My tape allowed me to decorate the birthday cards and personalize them with coordinating colors to send to my fellows. So this tape is a little expensive at first glance, but the possibilities are endless. This tape, with 3 different patterns, would give you MUCH more bang for your buck if you are using it for that reason. If you don't have an extra tape roll laying around, you can easily cut the tape as needed with scissors.Overall, a neat new product that can be used in so many creative ways! You can pop these into any tape dispenser and use them on any project or wrap. Unless you have two tape dispensers, you have to swap the colored rolls out when you need basic clear tape and switch back for decorating packages. I will search out red to go with the green tape. I can still use this tape as a margin accent on cards and such, but for art journaling, I'm sticking to washi tape. So it can do cute things.But the tape is pretty unsubstantial, not opaque as I'd like and the colors are not great. I was surprised to find that Scotch also makes decorative tape, and ordered this set in hopes that it would hold up to the Scotch brand and stick to whatever my little heart desired. It sticks to whatever regular "invisible" tape sticks to.My only complaint with this product is that it isn't easily dispensed. Like regular tape, it can be hard - though not impossible - to tear, and may require scissors to get each piece. I swapped it out with my clear tape in a tape dispenser, which is quick and easy, so this is a minor gripe. I used the patterned tape and it is so bright and cheerful. The Scotch Expressions Magic tape is a versatile tape that can be used for crafting. This tape provided beautiful accents to all the presents. I like this tape, but it's not quite all it's advertised to be. The tape is sticky, but not so sticky that it can't be repositioned, even on paper.Besides its obvious use for crafts, I thinks kids will enjoy using the tape for wrapping presents, although it's much more expensive than regular Scotch tape. So the tape definitely has some creative uses as long as you're aware of its limitations. I neither love nor hate this decorative tape. While this is not invisible tape, it is a lot of fun. I've found that I enjoy using this tape more on setting up scrapbook pages to put into folders or other places where you need a quick design on the corner of each photograph. Anything that can make scotch tape more fun is okay by me. This is basically scotch tape but maybe not as sticky. There's only 1 patterned tape and 2 solid ones. The tape is translucent.It's like regular Scotch tape, just with colors or patterns. It's not as sticky as regular tape so you can reposition it. You can write on it like regular Scotch tape. It can be torn.I think it's a neat tape for projects, scrapbooking and other fun activities, just a nice variation from regular Scotch tape. This is as good as regular Scotch tape, only it comes in a wide variety of fun colors and patterns, and costs only about thirty percent more for the same length. I prefer to use decorative tape to secure the tissue wrapping; making the item look neater & hopefully more enjoyable for my customers on the receiving end. The tape adheres just as well as the plain making it useful for keeping lip balm tins securely closed. I write little "Thank You's" on the tape, use it to secure little Thank You freebies with customer orders, & whatever else I think up. Therefore, you can use a standard tape dispenser to use it if you wish. This tape would be great for home, office or classroom use any time you want to add some fun to a project. You don't get very much tape per roll. I use tape for many different things, most notably taping up notes in my office and home. This tape just isn't as &#34;sticky&#34; as typical tape. I won't be using boring clear tape anymore. I think though that the Expressions tape would be fine for holding gift wrap in place.Generally, I'd say this is a specialty tape. I replaced the tape in both with the tape from this product. But Scotch tape is great primarily because it is clear and easy to use. This tape adheres well and can easily be taken off as easy depending on what you tape it to. I am very happy to have this tape and it will get used in my craft room to make different projects. The patterned tape is obviously meant to complement the two solid colors. The tape is hard to break by hand so you do need something with which to cut the tape. The tape is not acid free so be careful if you want to use this on something you want to save long term.This is nice colored tape that looks great if you use it to wrap a present. It seems like it is being sold as a tape with which to wrap presents rather than something to use for long term projects. This is an attractive tape to use for scrapbooking, card making, etc. She was very disappointed in this tape's performance. However, this tape is perfect for decorating non-decorated paper. Overall I did not like this tape. This tape is really cute! I use this tape to decorate envelopes that I send out when I do swaps in the mail. Although this isn't technically washi tape, that's what it's most similar to, and you'll find a lot of trendy ideas and uses for it.The reason I'm only giving the tape three stars, though, is because the pigment/design can be missing in spots, and the tape has a waxy texture that can get scratched easily. Because of that, I would most recommend the tape for use on projects that don't need to be durable, such as cards. I have used this tape for borders on paper stock and have also used it to decorate a birthday card. The tape can be re-positioned many times without it sticking or tearing the paper. This new tape from scotch is certainly fun and colorful. Paper tape is extremely popular right now and these tapes from scotch are vibrant and fun. Like regular clear tape, it's hard to get the end pulled up after using sometime. I like how you can now find tape in different colors and prints. Until I saw this tape I never really thought about alternatives to traditional clear tape. With this tape you can kind of use this in place of decorative ribbon. I was hoping to use this tape as decorative trim and thought this would be a bit more opaque than it is. If you layer up the tape, after about four layers, whatever markings that are under the tape will finally be hidden if you need to go that far.This tape does a good job holding weight against smooth surfaces better than regular scotch tape. This Expressions tape holds the paper on the wall with no problem. I imagine this would mean this tape would be a little better at holding odd surfaces together for craft projects.The tape feels a bit thicker than regular scotch tape so doesn't start clinging right away at nearby surfaces when it's held near. This helps place the tape more exactly when you're trying to place it just right to look nice. This tape arrived just in time for me to wrap some birthday gifts and make a personal card. I used the tape to decorate a the envelope for the card, which looked great with the wrapped gift. It won't replace using regular tape for many things but the varieties of Scotch Expressions Magic Tape available can turn some of those ho-hum things into humdingers.T
