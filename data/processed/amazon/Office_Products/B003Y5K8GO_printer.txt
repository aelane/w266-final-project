This is a fairly decent printer for the money, except that "for the money" goes a little further than the advertised price. Overall a printer that does not draw attention to itself as a piece of computer equipment, but will merge very well with a household full of modern devices.Printing on this machine can be a fast task, should you leave all the settings as they are. This is the Best printer I have ever used. This printer is better than any printer located in the law office  where I work. I bought this printer for two reasons. This was the first printer I ever bought that didn't require a computer to set it up. I definitely recommend this printer, as it delivers a lot for its price!I didn't rate customer service, since I didn't have any need for it; the printer worked great right out of the box. The printer was packaged in a light weight tote bag in the box, so I could just easily pull out the printer. This printer alone acts like a computer, and it included a step by step set up assistant on the main screen, which was great. And since this printer has wifi connectivity, I didn't need any extra equipment to buy, and I figured that's why the printer didn't come with a USB cable.Printing was also as easy as pie. As I mentioned, this printer acts like a computer, and it's connected to the Internet. I only wish this printer had a USB slot instead of a SD/MMC card only slot. This printer has its own email address, so just by sending an email to the printer, it will print out documents and photos. The printer automatically decided where to print (between regular paper and photo paper) depending on the file type I sent to the email, which I can also manage in the setting.Finally, if you have an iphone, you will love this feature. This printer has a speaker somewhere so it makes button sounds. And this printer falls asleep after idle time; the illuminated power button will then start breathing (Mac computers  do this during sleep mode. However, when the printer receives email or jobs, it wakes up instantly and starts printing. I have not stopped fiddling with this printer since I received it. HP Photosmart Plus B210 e-All-in-One Printer (CN216A#B1H)I got this printer to replace another older HP printer that I had damaged during a move. You can also print and scan directly from the printer and not use the computer at all.The picture quality is outstanding, bright, clear and sharp colors - all in no time at all.My other two printers had five ink cartridges and I wasn't sure how this printer would compare with only four ink cartridges. You can scan from the printer or computer and save or directly print. This is a great little printer for those on a budget and don't need a "professional" quality print. I would like to see this printer sell at $99.00; after all they really make the money on overpriced ink cartridges, which for this and other HP printers are readily available at local department store and office supply stores. I bought this printer on a whim from Staples. The printer figures out which paper should be used based on what you sent it and spits out the print.
