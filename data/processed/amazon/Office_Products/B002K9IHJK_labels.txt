These labels are the reverse of the regular Post-it we all know and love so well, in that the entire label sticks, while there is an edge that is unglued for easy removal.I love the colors! I have been cutting these labels into smaller pieces to use as temporary price tags, and also for notes on our POS terminal. I am using these labels on shelf edges to categorize some newspaper archives. These labels are easily removed and reused and suit my intended purpose perfectly. Half the labels are bright green, half are shocking pink!Another Bonus! You can easily remove the labels too, which I have had some experience. Wonderful labels! I might add, when you remove these labels, there is  NO residue. I was using mailing labels on them but then when I put a new staple into them, I had to write over them or add a label (the messy but easy ways to attack the problem), or I had to spend way too long scraping off the label and starting anew. I think I have finally found some adhesive labels that really stick on virtually anything and come off without a problem.I have used these so far on storage containers in my garage that contain camping supplies, automotive parts, and a host of other items in both plastic and wood containers. These handy little labels are very useful! Also loved that the labels have enough room to write a good description. All our labels remained intact despite needing to move them around quite a bit. These labels are extremely visible due to their eye-catching fluorescent colors and are also a decent size (so, depending on what you're using them for, they can be cut across to double the amount of labels), both definite pluses. These little labels are great for labeling things in your pantry or office, or maybe your toiletry cabinet. These labels fill a gap between ordinary labels and ordinary Post-its (TM). First, I noticed that I sometimes peeled off two labels instead of one. These new Post-it labels have the potential to become as ubiquitous as their forerunner, the Post-it note. These labels come in a pad, just like classic Post-its; that would have presented a problem in pulling off the individual labels, especially with the stickier adhesive; but 3M leaves a 1-cm border free of adhesive so that one can easily remove each label. I know these are to be for labels but I like them just for making notes, there is more sticky on them so I don't have to worry about them falling off whatever I put them on. As labels I don't like them as much as the rounded type of labels. These little sticky labels are ok, but they are nothing to get excited about. Nice sized labels in bright colors are very versatile. These labels are removed easily and can be reapplied easily too. I really like these removable labels for that specific task more than regular Post-It Notes, plus they're big enough I can list several things on one label. These vividly colored fluorescent green and pink labels really stand out. These labels come in handy for organizing just about anything. There are 100 labels included in all, in pink and green. These are what they say they are: labels. Previously, we were using address labels: once they were on, they stayed and would tear whatever they were stuck to when removing.Office supplies don't excite me. Reading labels on boxed items is much easier now and at a reasonable price. These labels work just as described. I love these labels. So nice to have these labels that I can put on my food storage and other storage boxes or notebooks and not worry about them leaving a sticky residue if I want to remove them later.Each label has a little tab to make it easy to apply. I have tried making my regular labels more removable by putting tissue in the center behind the label, but it's just not as good.So thanks to 3M, I can stick and remove all I want! These labels are great as they allow for mess-free removal when I change the contents of the bottle. I highly recommend these labels. These labels are basically Post-it notes but with weak sticky stuff covering one whole side, not just the top of the note. No more boring white labels or pieces of grey duct tape with writing on it (Like I used to do)  Very eye-catching and appealing.Works well with sharpies, or any ink really. These make great labels. Would be really handy when moving, etc, as the labels are nice and bright... a mildly fluorescent-looking pink and green. These labels are handy and they remove without leaving any residue. I would rather use erasable, reusable labels. I really like these labels. I couldn't get the labels apart, the entire back is sticky and there's suppose to be a line that isn't so you can easily separate the labels. These labels adhere to your item in their entirety. I wanted to use these labels for handwritten projects in my office (e.g., tax files, credit cards, my son's school art), our basement - where so many things lanquish unidentified in those big plastic storage tubs, and importantly, my hobby room, where I used small removable labels as well as these labels to clearly organize items without having to worry about the dreaded "it won't come off, and now it's ruined." These labels try to do that. The labels use the same type of paper of standardPost-it Note Pads, providing the same properties. Plus the labels stick, peel off, and re-stick to smooth surfaces as advertised.I have noticed slight curling on the non-stick strip side of the label when placed on smooth surfaces. the labels, curled up and fell off. the labels curled up and fell off again. These Super Sticky Post-it Labels will work just about anywhere and are great for labels, they're intended use, or even note taking. I cut these labels down to the size I need & save the rest for another task. The labels are small enough to be used on the spine of a binder,but large enough to write on clearly, or add useful information. I have used many Post It Products and their labels are very reliable. Please note that they are labels and not really notes as the entire back is sticky. As we started to label, I begin to mix the labels up (to aggravate my dad and to see how "removable" they were...to my surprise they were GREAT! These Post-it labels do the trick. They work great as labels for file folders, storage boxes and especially anything you need a temporary label on (like who brought the Green Bean Casserole).It is the removable adhesive that makes these better than the usual mailing labels, as they to destroy the paper on a file folder when pealed off. These labels advertise that you can stick them and then peel them off cleanly...I didn't find that to be the case. I really LOVE these little labels -- especially that they can be easily removed and leave no residue or torn paper behind. These are excellent labels. I believe that these labels have the right adhesive quality for their use. The labels do not have the adhesive strength that you would see on permanent labels, and that is a good thing. When I removed the labels, if I was at all careful, they did not tear.I didn't write on them with as many things as the other testers did. I basically feel that labels are the sort of thing you write on with sharpie markers, and those worked fine. Use the labels to indicate what is in the box. They are labels, and should be considered as such. You can even use them as temporary labels, then peel 'em off and stick them back on the pad for REUSE! I have been looking for removable labels on non-paper surfaces. I always want to put labels on storage boxes. I highly recommend it if you want to have removable labels on bottles or containers. Post-it labels are great for those nameless boxes in the closet that we all seem to have. These labels will allow you to do that without having to deal with the sticky glue residue that is so hard to remove when using traditional labels. These labels do exactly what they're advertised to do, they stick easily, are removable and you can actually take them off and re-stick them several times as long as your surface is clean and not dusty. I've been looking for easy to use labels for labeling refrigerator and freezer containers and I'm really happy with these. I have repositioned several labels and they're still going strong. The labels remove easily and leave no residue on the container (unlike masking/painter's tape!). I don't use these as labels on boxes, like the picture on the package shows, but rather use this for long-term reminders and shelf/bottle labels in the cupboard. These labels are easy to use, easy to remove, and look slick. There should be 200-400 labels in the package, not 100, at this price. I didn't pay for these labels, but if I had, I would have felt like I was highly overcharged for the small amount of product I received. These labels are essentially a Post-It note without the flap that lacks adhesive. Now the temporary labels won't fall off. I'm always skeptical of these reusable labels because usually once you've used them once, they curl up. These labels are sticky, but easily removable. I like temporary labels for my storage bins, be they the plastic rubbermaid shoe boxes or the tupperware jars for the different types of flour I use to bake with in my kitchen.These labels stay on and look good! They don't peel off like Avery's labels do. (I have the Avery labels and gave them five stars, now that they are peeling off my plastic boxes, I'd like two of those stars back! First, I'd like to start by noting that these are labels, not post-it notes; thus, the entire back is adhesive as opposed to a small strip at the top.I was initially surprised because I expected the paper to be thinner, but thicker is good. And the labels didn't fall off once*.However, after the eleventh removal, it's reaching the end of its life and the corners are starting to curl up. Though they didn't fall off, some of the labels I've used on plastic bins began to curl at the edges after a few days--these were usually the bins I didn't keep in a climate controlled area. So I'm thinking these labels aren't designed for long-term (i.e. If you like your labels bright and bold (I do) these are a great pick. I've used other bright sticky labels, but none are such a great size or as reliable when it comes to staying where you put them.I use them in my office to separate stacks of paper, to call attention to items I'd probably forget about otherwise, and this morning, to call the postman's attention to a letter he's delivered to our business twice now. Oh these are Heaven on Earth for sticky labels. The labels even have a tab on the end so that they are easy to remove should you need to. These little labels are great. These labels can be written on easily with pencil or pen.T
