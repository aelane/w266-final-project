Epson quality is something I have grown to depend on. It has comparable quality to the Brother Laser. Print quality is crisp and clear. It is near to laser quality. The quality is there, and the printer cartridges are more affordable. Print quality is average, color is nice, but picture not very sharp. For better quality prints, I will recommend a lazer printer if budget is not a problem. Print quality is average, color is nice, but picture not very sharp.

Printing quality was identical to that of other Epson printers within both the Home Office line and Small Office line. The quality isn't professional, but it's good enough for the type of artsy pictures I take/use, and the small frames I typically use them in.Setup on Windows wasn't bad. Print quality is fine, I think the ink consumption will be all right judging on what I've used so far. I have noticed that the quality difference between Normal and the next quality down is pretty extreme.
