I use only Canon cartridges for my Canon printer. I've tried several of the generic cartridges and have had a lot of success with them before, but after time it was becoming wasteful. I would buy several combatible cartridges in each color and out of the bunch I bought, there were always several that wouldn't work and I had to throw out full cartridges of ink. I decided it was better to get the OEM cartridges even though they are more expensive than the combatible ones. I don't print as much any more so the OEM cartridges last longer. These are the only cartridges that work with my printer so it is difficult to review them since I have no experience with other cartridges. These small cartridges do not go far even when cutting back on intensity. Plus, I feel like the cartridges last us a while, so it's hard to complain too much. I am sure these cartridges are fine but I am concerned with the lack of clear information as to whether they are genuine or re-manufactured. I am using the cartridges and they seem to work well so I gave them three stars.

The pictured CLI-221 cartridges are for use with the 610's successor, the MP560 (Canon's retrograde numbering system for its printers confuses matters even more).

I have several B3 Black and Yellow cartridges from my previous Canon and, of course, they don't fit the 2 year old PIXMA.I feel like the guy at the race track who says, "I hope I break even.

Unless you purchase refilled cartridges, these are the best price I have found.
