The monthly calendar board is clean, easy to update, and to organize. Also, this is the calendar tile, but there are also blank tiles as well. This is a solid, well-constructed calendar with the great flexibility that comes with this type of calendar. This calendar is exactly what I was looking for. Needed a dry-erase calendar for over my desk. Recommend this as a useful, versatile calendar. This calendar will have many uses in our homeschool room. First, it will be used to teach reading the calendar to my little ones. We can set this calendar up for her in those situations so she can mark off the days until the event occurs. My calendar came dented because it's just a piece of particle board and the corners got squished. Instead, the calendar is not magnetic, but comes with two small magnets. Other than that, the calendar is fine. The actual calendar is magnetic, but to me, it's seriously a joke as there is no room to attach anything to the board, unless you want to cover the dates. The calendar also has included two sticky back foam pieces that adhere to the back of the calendar and to the area where you'll hang it. I am very happy with this calendar! Although it is a 5-week monthly calendar my husband and I found it also works great as a notice board.

I was looking for a calendar we could place on our refrigerator.

This calendar is metal with print on it, and a cardboard tucked beneath the metal to give it shape.

So you need a dry-erase calendar to plot out your...let's say...plans to rule the world?
