Since I'm trying to trim an 8 1/2 x 11 paper into 6 pieces that are 4 1/4 x 3 1/2 (with a little left over) I need a paper cutter with measurements and cuts that are accurate. This paper cutter has all the features necessary to be a good scrapbooking tool. This paper cutter works much better than the previous 'wheel' cutter that I was using - and doesn't have any problems with cutting through several sheets at once.Overall, I highly recommend this paper cutter if you're looking for a great tool that is portable. This paper cutter is made of heavy duty plastic with metal cutting edges. You have to slip your paper against the top and make sure to press the sheets down as cutting.It doesn't like thinner paper. It trims paper well. It the paper is held in place from the left side with some strength the cut will take place with ease up to 8 sheets. I bought this paper cutter for craft projects. I use this paper cutter so much that the blade has gotten duller but I've used a kitchen knife sharpener and it now works much better. The old paper trimmer that I used back in school was very heavy, as it was made of wood. This paper cutter is what it is, and it gets the job done. I use a much heavier and more expensive paper cutter at work, and I will be recommending this model to my boss as a replacement, since we are moving offices soon. This X-ACTO paper trimmer is my first guillotine trimmer.I like this trimmer very much. There's also a paper guide, which helps make multiple cuts the exact same size every time.The grid is in inches, but there is a ruler above that is marked in centimeters. For basic paper trimming, the X-ACTO is superior. It cuts more paper in one pass and the cuts are square. You may lose the paper guide if you don't lock it, which I think one of the improvements that can turn this to a better product.Both English and metric are represented using inches and centimeters.Most paper trimmers I have seen are made with wooden bases; this one is made of plastic except for the blades. This is a decent paper trimmer for the price. It is like the big paper cutter you see in businesses, or church libraries, etc. Summary: A great, inexpensive, compact and lightweight paper cutter, perfect for photos and other light duty work - don't expect to cut more than 6 sheets of copy paper at a time though!Our typical paper cutting involves scissors or straight edges and X-ACTO knives on a mat.

I'm using it to cut large inkjet paper sheets into smaller sizes for printing.

This paper cutter has some design advantages over the "rotary" style cutters that are prevalent in most school and office venues today.
