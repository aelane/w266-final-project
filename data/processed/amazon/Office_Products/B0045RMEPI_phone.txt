I also enjoyed using a regular phone again versus the poorer sound quality of a cell phone. Try that with your phone company! Sure, you can have completely FREE phone service if you want, but there may be some minor issues. I can pick up my phone and dial **2 before the number so the calls route through my work number. It is cheap but a miserable VOIP phone experience, trust me. We tried to cut down on phone bills by eliminating long distance from our landline, keeping it only for emergencies and limited local calling, and replacing it with a Skype phone number, but needing to place phone calls on the computer quickly became more of a hassle than it was worth. I considered getting a Skype phone, but wasn't impressed with the reviews I saw on them.The Obihai seemed too good to be true, but it really is good! Incoming phone calls come into the Obihai, and I can dial out on the landline using the Obihai by punching a code into the phone. Apparently you have to have used the Google phone number before you can set it up with the Obihai. I could make phone calls from my tablet using the hospitals WIFI!!!! You plug a phone into the box. You're new phone system is set up with your Google Voice number.It has a million little complicated settings and features that you -could- dive into but I have yet to need to do anything beyond what I stated above.So, for me, it took about 10 minutes to completely set up and begin making calls.Here's a tip - if you don't have an extra phone, buy a $20 DECT cordless phone on Amazon and use it with your new box. You have a new, free phone line. I don't like to talk on the phone much, and overall my phone usage is very minimal and I carry an iPhone at all times.

You can use a regular phone, you don't need any program or browser to make it work and your computer can be sleeping and it will still work.

I get to keep my original phone number and have free service, with caller ID, call forwarding and tons of other features free.

I have one phone connected to the Obi, and about 3-4 handsets connected to the one base phone.
