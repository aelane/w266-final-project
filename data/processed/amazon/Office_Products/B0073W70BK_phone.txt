The phone system is in great shape. This is the first Panasonic phone I've had where there was no number. The phone number will immediately appear. I'm still extremely happy with this phone, more so than ever.UPDATE: MAY 21 One of my handsets stopped ringing. It's a phone. Sounds just like a corded phone. So I bought a V-tech...It was that phone totally clarity Best phone purchase I ever made and it was on sale. This phone has excellent reception, button number are large and speaker phone is clear and I highly recommend this phone. Such as "Answer phone in living room". But the all black makes the phone look cheap. This phone does not have this. If you require this then read up on any phone you seek. This was my first Panasonic phone. You really should have one hard wired basic phone in your house - the cost is minimal from $10.00 to $25.00Whatever model you choose - these Panasonics are near perfect. We recently bought a cheap Wal-Mart phone, and were disappointed that the battery charge only lasted around 45 minutes. We then decided to buy a Panasonic phone. Have a Mickey Mouse phone system called NetTalk duo which makes it impossible for me to use some of the Panasonic system's capabilities. I forgot I had this phone in my pocket and my husband called to find the handset and it rang 2 acres away and the sound was still good.

The phone book and everything else is set on all 4 phones with just one entry.

If you have entered your VM phone # in your phone book just click under VM and Voice Mail will automatically be dialed for you.
