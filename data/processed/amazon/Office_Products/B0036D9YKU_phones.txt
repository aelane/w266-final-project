both phones are working great just the way i knew they would and i know they will work for sometime I like that you can put the phones on any base (I have one phone that I use most often, so when it dies I switch it out with one of the others) and that there's an intercom feature (not that I've ever used it. As it turns out, many of the Panasonic phones have this jack. I was looking for phones that had an earbud jack, so I could use it hands free. basic cheap phones. We've had these phones for over a year now and they're still going strong. Before you know it, we're going to be expecting our phones to last longer than a year... :)[*** UPDATE 1/23/2014 ***]Believe it or not, we are still using these phones; although, they are definitely looking worn now - and the headset jack is completely broken on a couple of them.About a year ago, we also added a set ofPanasonic KX-TG7742Sphones that we're using side-by-side with these, and I suspect that's helping extend the life a bit since we're able to spread the usage around a bit more.Regardless, I'll definitely post once these phones start dying - for now, they're still going strong! These are awesome phones - I bought them for additions onto my existing Panasonic set with KX-TGA651 phones. The phones themselves are great - they take normal rechargeable AAA batteries, have mute buttons, a speakerphone, a belt clip and a headphone jack. When you are done installing you might have to charge the phones. And the phones are really light :) triple awesomeness! both phones include this function. I am happy with these phones though the only negative is that it isn't super easy to set up phone book in it. These phones are great and work beautifully and keep their charge. Yes, I have modern phones all over the house but since I needed a new one in the kitchen anyway, I sprang for these--and I'm glad that I did.When it comes to phones I'm not going to spend hours reading the rather involved (and tedious) manual that came with them, but I glanced at it. My 10-year-old V-Tech phones are finally wearing out, so I began by buying a Uniden package at a warehouse club. These phones are excellent, great range , sound quality.
