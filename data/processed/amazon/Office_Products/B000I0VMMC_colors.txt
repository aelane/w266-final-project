Vibrant colors,tip shapes and quick drying eliminates smudging - bottom line a great pen! When you need to use colors to highlight different things these work great for that and I like it that you can use any color you like and still see thru it some highlighters are too dark to see anything thru to the words Some of the colors are just too dark to use for highlighting (the red and purple are more like markers, not highlighters.) The colors are great, the price wasn't that bad, they come in a case for easy traveling. brilliant colors in this pack. Most of the colors are nice and bright, although there are a couple that seem a bit too dark to use as highlighters.Now I need to go get a set of retractable permanent markers! Finally, the colors are a little dark for highlighting. The colors are bright and easily used for their intended purpose.A great idea that was too long coming. The colors don't overpower text, though the dark blue and purple are a bit darker than expected.These pens come in their own personal pen holder, so they're easy to store. Bold colors and they work very well. For the other colors, you can absolutely still see the text underneath but I just don't find the colors vibrant enough.-----------OLD REVIEW (9/6/10)Unlike other reviewers who thought that the colors of the dark blue and magenta were too dark to read the text underneath, I found the highlighters to be bright and work great. Some colors are rather dark as another reviewer stated.To test whether they were "smear-free" as prominently advertised on the package, I did a test. The colors are vivid, and stand out very well on the page. However, because you get 8 colors in the set, you have 6 colors that highlight very well, so this is a minor dislike. The colors were ok, it needs a true purple instead of a pink and a magenta. Having eight colors to choose from is useful. All of the colors can be used for highlighting, but for practical purposes some are more transparent; whereas others are better used for underlining, circling, writing, or even coloring. The red, true-blue and magenta colors are a bit dark for highlighting text, but are great for writing or drawing. So I don't think I'd use those colors to highlight something I need to read, like in a text book. Some of the colors in this multipack are relatively dark. The colors are very bright and vivid and they last a long time. Each of these colors should be used for borders, arrows and other incidentals. I used each of the eight colors in the set all highlighting the same question.Overall I like this set. "Love these!The eight colors are: red, orange, yellow, green, aqua blue, indigo blue, hot pink, and pink. They work perfectly, have brilliant colors that don;t seem to fade and they don;t dry out any faster than a capped highlighter. Unfortunately, the colors, with the sole exception of yellow, are quite dull and leave visible streaks from each stroke. There are many colors to choose from. The colors are red, pink, orange, yellow, green, teal (aqua? Very nice colors and packaging as well. They are well represented by the colors of the pens.Of all of the choices, I found one to be too dark for normal highlighting in that it obscured the text and made it hard to read. "I like the multiple colors; It makes it easy to highlight different things with different meanings/key codes. Even running different colors over each other does not produce a smear. The colors are vibrant and just right to hi-lite with because they don't bleed onto another page! It's great to have so many colors without having to worry about any caps. Several of the other colors are a TAD on the dark side but still quite usable. Perhaps they made the colors so dark so you wouldn't notice the blur so much, lol. The colors are vibrant and I like that they are slim as opposed to the big and bulky highlighters that are everywhere.

The colors remain sharp and clear since they don't pick up ink from the print.

Having eight colors is nice because you can share with someone else, color-code your work, or just pick a color to suit your mood.PLUS, they come in a vinyl pouch.

The more I use these, the less satisfied I am with the colors.
