The binder that I received is a bubblegum pink color as oppossed to the fuchsia pink that was shown on the computer. First off, let me say I think this binder is a little over-priced. I really liked how this binder looked. It appears to be a solid enough binder to survive his abuse...time will tell. This binder is a light pink color, not well represented on the monitor. I love that the binder has a front window so I can put a picture right on the front. The binder is sturdy and the rings latch well, very straight and even.This is a plastic binder, so it is flexible plastic; it is not a hardcover binder. This three ring binder is available in a variety of different colors including pink, red, black, blue, green and white. If you're about to charge $12 on a binder, it needs to be a mighty fine binder. This is not a mighty fine binder. This is a large binder that can hold up to 300 pages. I tend to keep a binder for each class I take or teach and this is a perfect size.It has a framed pocket on the front that makes it a lot more durable feeling. This one is best perhaps to replace a spiral binder. This binder is great! This binder presents a bit of a new concept. Unfortunately, they are only connected to the binder cover itself in two places, and I question whether those two fasteners are going to hold up in the long term. I want to like this binder more than I do. This binder has a "clearview" cover, which is not clear but more....frosted. This is a really great binder, with a nice space to feature a photo or whatever you like on the front.It is really well built and feels like it'll last a long time, doing the long days being carried and thrown around and still be ready for you.On the inside there's a divider that has two pockets and everything about this feels durable.Quality! This is an awesome binder. I would definitely recommend this binder. The binder itself seems okay. I hope, more than expect, the binder will last an entire school year. This particular binder seems very durable and should hold up. It's a nice binder and tough enough. This Mead binder boasts that it will last all year (guaranteed!) It's a 1.5&#34; binder and is large enough to hold a lot of paper. This binder is unusual in that it is flexible and has a window in the front that one can place a document or picture in to customize it yet it also is high capacity. A 1.5&#34; binder is good for storing papers for more than one subject. The binder comes in attractive colors and has  sturdy front and back covers. I think this is a really great binder. Some binder rings are so stiff to open and shut so loudly that it's almost scary when you think about it possibly snapping on your finder someday. This one is pretty easy to open and close.This binder also has a durable, plastic 2 pocket divider.We have this binder in the Pink option and it's nice and bright, unlike the darker, purplish looking color that it appears in the listing. This is a sturdy binder built to last. For them, I have found that a flexible binder in general will make it farther though the school year. The binder, as shown, contains a 1.5-inch ring that opens and closes.
