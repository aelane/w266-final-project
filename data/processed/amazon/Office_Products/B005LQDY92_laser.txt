The red laser pointer will not work unless the USB dongle is out of the storage slot (safety mechanism).5. The laser is bright and on par with other laser pointers I've seen and used.Now, onto the mouse button layout: The big round button is for the laser. This laser pointer is a good entry level model. The built in laser pointer is an added plus, and projects a nice bright red light. It also has an integrated laser pointer that is relatively bright even at 30 feet. This is a laser pointer, wireless presenter (powerpoint presentations) and a pointing stick mouse (Track point) - all in one. The laser pointer is just that, a red dot to point out the part of the slide you are talking about.You operate the mouse with a rubber button--easy to manipulate by rotating it under a finger. The laser is operated by a center button on a navigator over the mouse buttons, and it's surrounded by page up/page down buttons.Who can use it?This is a handy device for anyone who does a lot of seminars or meetings with slide presentations. I basically use this for the laser pointer.However, the mouse abilities of this device, give it an added dimension.Not only a standard slide clicker for your power point presentations, but mouse ability also, for clicking on various items within your presentation or desktop.Other devices similar to this that I've used have a small bay to insert the USB stick component, on this device, you need to open the back panel, and un-seat the USB stick component. I would like to be able to use the laser pointer even when I don't need to use the other buttons.The USB receiver is the cheesiest-looking USB device I've ever seen. I guess that will improve with time.The laser pointer is a bit dimmer than what I'm used to; that may improve with better batteries (the included batteries are not alkaline).All in all, it works as advertised without any real problems. Save the green laser for a larger hall; good ol' red will do fine otherwise.The USB receiver stores neatly under the battery cover.
