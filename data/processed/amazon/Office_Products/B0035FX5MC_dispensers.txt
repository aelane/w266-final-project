We've used several dispensers for notes. These are just the greatest little dispensers! That's why it was impossible for me to resist these Post-it Pop-up Notes Dispensers.To be honest, I really didn't want to stick the dispensers on my desk or the office wall, but that didn't matter - they worked perfectly on my monitor stand, which puts them at a very comfortable height and keeps them within arm's reach.The dispensers were easy to affix to the surface and the pop-up notes were even easier to load in the dispenser. Ahh, very peaceful.I received two dispensers, each included mounting tabs and Super Sticky Post-it 3"x3" Pop-up notes (the Post-its with the zig-zag Pop-up icon). for them.The dispensers I received came with bright green and bright blue Post-it Notes. I plan to pick up two more of these dispensers for other rooms of my house. The dispensers affix to a clean surface using Velcro attached to adhesive sticky tape. Both dispensers were sturdy and free of defect. I was lucky enough to receive two handy dispensers with pop-ups and quickly affixed one to the side of my stainless steel fridge that everyone in the home would have easy access to.

The dispensers can be glued to any surface, but are also easily removed.
