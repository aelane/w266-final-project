The holder is cardboard. That ended up tearing the holder and the top sheet. But the holder is just a very light weight cardboard, or a heavy weight paper that the Post-it pad is inserted into. The holder has tape on the back, remove the protective film that covers the tape, and stick the holder anywhere. It's the holder! However, I did find the little holder thing to be a bit fiddly and ended up just pulling the deck of post-its out of the sleeve and throwing the sleeve away. All you really have here, is a holder that contains Post-It Notes. With this adhesive Post-It holder (with Post-It Notes), it almost forces you to keep them in one place.

But, it is convenient to have a little holder nearby.

However, the holder is a thin laminated cardboard which has already ripped and if you are a heavy post-it user, you'd be refilling this a lot.I think I'll stick to throwing a pack in my bag instead of this.

Now all I need is a sticky pen holder... (I'm always losing my pens) .BTW, you can't beat the price Amazon is offering and refills can be found on this page:http://www.amazon.com/Post-Laptop-Pop-up-Refill-LND-330-3SC/dp/B003FMEK10/myshelf
