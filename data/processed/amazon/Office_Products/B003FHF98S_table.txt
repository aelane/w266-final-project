The table dispensers stick to the table, even if wood, which allows you to free up two hands. Each table top holder has two packages of tape already inserted inside of it so you can start wrapping right after opening the package!The Hand Bands- Of the two dispensers in this kit, I used this more than the table top holder. It doesn't stop you from sliding it anywhere you want on the table, just picking it up. It's easier to just slide if off the table, but if you insist, it comes up. But this really did make it easier.I don't care so much about the table top dispensers -- I don't feel like they can replace a regular tape dispenser, and I usually use a desk dispenser (rather than the disposable roll), so it's not too hard to tear a piece off.If you want both, this is a nice set. I was working on a small table, so only used the hand dispenser. (Okay, I have tried using the table dispensers. The table dispenser is less effective, since it doesn't stay put easily. They are readily available because the table top dispensers adhere to the table or desk top. What I like about the table dispensers is that there is grip bottom that keeps the dispenser, for the most part, gripped to the surface yet you can easily slide it around.

To remove them from the table once you're finished, simply slide them to the edge of the table and they slip right off.

The table toppers work well and adhere tightly to surfaces.

A terrible clean table they do slide around a bit.
