But the compatible cartridges I tried worked OK, so far.Update: I'm changing this to a one star because of trouble and expense.The ink turned out to be even more expensive than I had imagined. The cartridges did not work and caused all kinds of error messages and even caused the printer to shut down. When I went back to the OEM cartridges, the printer worked and the color was immediately corrected. Those cartridges seemed to work as well as Canon OEM cartridges. As I mentioned,the refillable cartridges did not work at all and the ink color was off. But I do know that the refillable cartridges caused a lot of trouble and didn't work. Please understand that the Blake compatible cartridges seemed to print with the same exact quality as Canon OEM cartridges. The cartridges are TINY and they run out before you know it. I don't know if it is, but maybe it does that when you remove and install cartridges. The other cartridges lost a HUGE amount of ink just within a couple minutes during what appeared be unauthorized and consecutive print head cleanings by the printer just a few minutes ago. With OEM cartridges, my loss just during the last few minutes would have probably been around $20.00 and this is without printing anything but 2 nozzle check pages! And some refillable cartridges don't work unless you buy special chips for them and even then you have to keep putting new chips on the refillable cartridges every time you refill them. Other refillable cartridges require that you remove the chips from OEM cartridges and put the OEM chips on the refillable cartridges.

Ink cartridges though, are included.The instructions  to set it up are straightforward and you may not even need them, install and use was smooth in a laptop running on windows 7.
