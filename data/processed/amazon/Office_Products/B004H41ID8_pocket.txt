I used the small pocket inside a blank book that I use for design notes, so I can keep yarn labels and receipts in the back.The pockets have a neutral white-on-clear dot design and a printed bar you can use if you wish to label them. Having them in an easily accessible pocket would be very convenient. The pocket is hanging in there despite a lot of use. I got the 3-pack with one pocket each for letters, bills (i.e., folded letters), and receipts and coupons. Each pocket sticks to a surface, such as the side of a cabinet or a door, and can hold quite a number of paper items of the right size. It has dot pattern all over the pocket, so it is not for holding there some kind of a reference print, since you will not be able to read it. For me, the large pocket is the most useful, but different uses seem to pop up everywhere! in the pocket. The big pocket holds regukar 8.5 x 11 paperwork. Instead of manuvering around them, I can pull them off, clean and then replace the pocket. Try to cram more in the pocket and you'll only frustrate yourself. This allows the pocket to expand some if you happen to cram a bunch of stuff in there but it does so at the cost of having the ends curl forward away from the wall a bit rather than lay flat. Another pocket goes inside the hall closet door, for gas receipts, ONLY...  All in all, these are a very nice idea, but very much overpriced, considering the capacity and usefullness.
