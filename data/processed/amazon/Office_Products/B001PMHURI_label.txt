This AVERY Repositionable white label measures a generous 2"x4" and prints clean without smudges. I experimented with lifting the same label off and back on a few times to test it -- worked beautifully. I am forever positioning a label, then having need to remove it to get it on "straight". Ever had that label hit the package before you were ready? So, if you can benefit by a label that will come off once, maybe twice if you're fortunate, while not damaging either the surface it was stuck too or the label, for use again then this is a good choice with the caveat of around 90% material compatibility. You can use the label wizard from Word or Avery's own software from the internet.The only weird thing about the labels I received is that they have a really odd smell. I stuck and remove and re-stuck the label 10 times. You are able to remove the label and reapply it to the correct envelope without making a mess! As long as you remove the label within the first several hours, it comes off without a problem and it will restick to a new envelope. They are repositionable and they can be removed and reapplied without damaging the label or the envelope. Rounded label cornersThe disadvantages are:1. When I tested them, I was able to remove and replace the label several times, even days later. I want and need a label that's going to stick to the package, through rain, sleet, snow and mail handlers hands. the label survived my testing without tearing up or leaving fibers behind. *Rounded label corners, not squared/pointed. But, if you peel the label up by the corners, they become distorted and do not reapply the same as the initial application.Overall, this is an descent quality Address Label. I dont want to worry that a label will fall off after I mail it and before it reaches it's destination. Lifting the label off to re-position never works, the paper tears, it's all a mess.So they arrived, appealing to the perfectionist in me, and they did not disappoint. I will never by a non-repositionable label again.

If you have to move the label as it isn't straight or something, you can lift and reapply it but I think that is also risky as I wouldn't want the "glue" to weaken and my label fall off but handy if you need it.

I'd have to print out another label.

I did also put a label on a container holding my various USB cords, a few weeks ago.
