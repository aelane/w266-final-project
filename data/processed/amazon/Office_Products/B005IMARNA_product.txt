I'm using them for exactly what they were designed for; promoting my own product. They are perfect for branding a product and do allow you to print on the entire label and not just a predetermined space within the template.If you're looking for a label for barcodes, QR codes or simply a label to promote your business, you cannot go wrong with these Avery labels. This product offers a lot of versatility. This product appears to be driven towards small businesses so you can print bar codes for scanning and/or make labels with your business name. With Christmas approaching, I'll be using this product to make to make "To:  From: " labels for my kids Christmas gifts and future Birthday presents. This is a nice product, nice size (2x2"), great for a wide variety of applications: marketing, product mockups, school, crafts, etc.The TrueBlock is also nice - the label is opaque so nothing underneath shows through.Avery designed these for use as a barcode or QR code, but in my opinion, 2"x2" is too big for that. I used it on my product catalogs so customers can scan with their smartphone and go right to my online catalog. They make a good product and they didn't let me down this time.

The product description emphasizes using these labels for advertising, but they are blank 2x2 inch squares that you can use for anything.

A nice product.

I just can't say enough about this product that is essentially a sticky, printable, square!The only thing to consider - and this wasn't a big deal for me - was that I had to download the template from a website.
