It is so much faster and easier to set up a file than with the old style tabs that had to be folded and inserted into slots. The Pendaflex Ready Tab is great, if you want conventional file folders with unconventional tabs and colors. I have a regular file console with 2 drawers but it's hard to reach from my desk chair as the room is small (my den). These file folders have a unique slide out tab that is permanently attached in 5 positions, allowing you to stagger the tabs the way you want. There, is only so much you can say about file folders, but here is my assessment of this product. These file folders from Pendaflex are ideal for any office. They work just as good as any other file folders I've used in the past.The plus side of these folders is that they have a built in white tab. I really like these file folders. They are well made and pretty strong for file folders. These hanging file holders are fun and spunky in the assorted colors. Most file folders get tossed when you decide to change the subject or item being kept inside because of the label. Well, these file tabs have strength, plus order and neatness to help you keep all your files in order..Buy them now! In the past, I had the original green file folders which were sturdy but not very stylish.Pendaflex: I loved these right away since they have an easy access opening, which I plan on cutting Smead's container the same way.

All of my file folders are a military green and these bright colors also make the file drawer more attractive to the eye.
