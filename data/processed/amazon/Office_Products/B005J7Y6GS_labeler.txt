I love, love, LOVE this labeler. This is a fantastic labeler. Previously I'd used the Brother labeler and made "flag" style (which this model also does automatically) by printing the word twice and then wrapping it around. In all it's a great labeler. This is one great little labeler! This labeler is completely different from any other labeler I've had before. My first labeler lasted ten years, the next one 2, and the last one 6 months. With my previous labeler, I had no choice but to accept the default way it came out.

For $50, you get a great labeler with the Epson.

For around $65, you get an amazing labeler with a lot more flexibility if you went the Brother P-Touch route.

This little labeler is COMPLICATED.
