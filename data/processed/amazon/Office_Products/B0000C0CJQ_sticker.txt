You basically get plain sticker sheets of paper, that I fed into my printer to get printed designs, that I then cut out.I found just the thing to use these on - to put cute stickers on a cabinet with clear doors - to hide the mountain of medicine, vitamins, etc on it's shelves from plain view. This is basically a giant blank sticker sheet which permits you to print any shape that you like; you just need to cut it out yourself. I was looking for an easy-to-remove but sturdy sticker to use in my mate's vending machine business when I found Avery's Sticker Project Paper. These sticker pages are great! I use these sticker papers and wrap them around glass mason jars to decorate homemade cookies. They can print one sticker or a page of stickers. Nice sticker paper that prints well. Love this sticker paper. These are great if you need a sticker in an unconventional size or shape. You print what you want or need to be a sticker and cut it out into the shape you desire.

These special sticker papers are more thicker and are re positionable.
