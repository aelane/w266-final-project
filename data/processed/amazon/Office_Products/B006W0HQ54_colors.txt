The colors are rich and vivid, and of course permanent as you expect from a Sharpie. They are strong colors, leaving no uncertainty how blue or green or yellow the line is.Do be careful as the tip can flatten if too much pressure is used. The colors are bright and vibrant, the ink dries fast and tends to be smudge-resistant, even on difficult surfaces, and depending how you hold the marker, you can get everything from a thin fine line to a bold thick one. The colors are vibrant. The colors are vibrant and the tips allow for both fine and thick lines and fill-ins. The colors are vibrant and have a nice range of choices, and the "brush" works well to create lines from thin to thick. The included 12 colors offer a nice range suitable for pretty much any task or writing surface. The colors are vibrant and bright, the markers glide effortlessly on paper, and the brush tip is much more for versatile for writing.While I am not using these for any special art projects, I frequently use Sharpies when I am teaching. I'll be using them to freshen up the colors on some of my appliques, to color in different things, and for general marking - anything that doesn't need a fine point. Overlapping colors create different variations. I love to draw with all of these colors, too! They don't quite match the colors on the caps, but then how could they? The colors these create are very bright, and allows the user to control the width of the lines, as needed, thick or thin. Super saturated colors are great. The colors are very vibrant, but you do not get any type of shading - the color stays pretty much the same no matter how hard or light you draw.The only thing I think might be a problem for some users is that the color will bleed through the page you are marking unless you are using card stock or something similar. However, they are not opaque, so will not be visible on dark colors. I especially love that the colors are vivid and do not soak thru too much on poster paper. The colors are bright, there's a nice variety of colors, and the brush tips let you draw thick or thin lines.I personalized a mug from the dollar store with these markers, and it looks great. The colors are rich and vibrant and last.Recommended highly.....I'd buy them again and most likely will be buying them again! I would love to have more colors than the twelve I have. The colors are vibrant and I love the selection of colors in this 12 pack. The colors are super crisp, and bright with the perfect amount of ink flow.
