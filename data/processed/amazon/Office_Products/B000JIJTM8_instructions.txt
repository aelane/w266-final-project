The instructions are literally made for people who can't read, so don't expect much written instruction. There are really no written instructions at all. The instructions merely list the parts and have pictures for the assembly, and that first picture is a little busy. The instructions are horrible. Finally, I figure I'll go back and decipher the instructions and get it put together - but my 7 year old son had already built the entire thing. When questioned about the instructions:  "what instructions? "Soooo, really, this isn't difficult to put together, UNLESS you try to follow the instructions. He even said these instructions stink. However, the poor instructions and the thoughtless way that some of the parts go together (especially those caster wheels) really deserves a one star rating. I do not like instructions that rely solely on pictures. It's best to study these instructions thoroughly before diving in. It's just that the instructions blow. The instructions were clear and all we needed was a screw driver. I was not able to just blindly follow the instructions. The instructions were zero help on this issue.Overall the table is solid and well build. The instructions are terrible, the pieces are not clearly marked, and the screws are located in very tight corners. However, the instructions were horrible and 4 pieces were damaged quite badly in the shipping process.
