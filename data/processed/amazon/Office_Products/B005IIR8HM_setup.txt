As for this Epson, I found the setup quick and easy, although I do have some experience setting up hardware such as printers. The setup was very simple and straightforward. I'd say setup ended up being about an hour.Printing is such a dream. I found setup to be easy and fast.I never had to worry about printing any more. I followed the quick setup guide and used a USB cable initially as suggested by the quick setup guide. The setup was very quick and easy. During setup, you're asked if you want to set up the printer wirelessly or via a "temporary USB connection", that is labeled as "recommended". During setup, you get a page printed telling you about the printer's capability to print stuff you email to a specific address. The setup disc added two printers to my "Devices" tab. The initial setup is a little time consuming, but it's not difficult. The guided setup process works great, first time, for initial install and for additional computer installs.I have a wireless home network already so adding the printer to it was a piece of cake.
