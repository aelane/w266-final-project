There are two paper trays (which allows the printer to hold over 500 sheets at a time) on the front that accommodate letter and legal paper. When using legal paper the trays extend out of the front of the printer by about 2 inches. For smaller paper sizes, heavy paper stock, or envelopes there is a small feeder around back. All the paper ran through smoothly and without jamming. It is easy to copy a paper individually or through the feeder. It has two big paper trays, one holds my paper, the other holds my self-stick mailing labels (I do a lot of e-commerce sales). It also has a third, straight paper path tray in the back which is also great for holding about 10 envelopes. Both of them can handle Envelopes, Plain paper, and Photo paper, but in addition the 4540 can also handle iron on transfers.The standard media capacity is 580 sheets for the 4540 and 500 for the 840. That said, I had no paper feed difficulties, even with doublesided scanning and printing, and out of the box, everything worked as promised.

The paper handling is much more trouble free than the HP 7780 that it replaced. However, you CANNOT copy onto the paper that is put into the rear tray! It will only let you print double sided on plain paper. I chose the 4540 instead of the 4530 because I wanted the extra paper feed, 580 instead of 330. If the additional paper feed is not an issue, you can save some money with the 4530. It is faster than my 840, and it holds more paper. Throwing paper into the paper tray and having multiple cassettes to select from is just way too convenient. Also, if I load photo paper into the tray I don't have to tell the printer to use that tray, it just seems to know that the other two are loaded with regular paper and pull from the tray for the photo. Notably, it has two paper trays for less down time replenishing paper and large capacity ink cartridges. The paper capacity is huge. )- Handles many different paper sizes. And with two paper cassettes on the bottom of the printer that hold 500 pages (total), and another place in the back of the printer that holds 80 pages, you don't have to add paper often.-  According to the manufacturer's claims, the ink cartridges can print up to 1,200 pages of color and up to 2400 pages of black-and-white before they need to be replaced.
