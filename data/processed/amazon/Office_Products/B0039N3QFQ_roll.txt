I prefer the roll because it is cheaper, lasts longer, and I can get whatever length piece of tape I want. While it is definitely easier to use than the roll, it could get pricey - something I really don't need right now. I, however, am very happy with my roll of Scotch Tape. When I use my roll of tape, I can cut pieces of various sizes as needed. A simple roll of tape is probably cheaper and will last longer. However, if you are like me, I throw the roll of tape in a drawer or the wrapping paper box to keep it out of sight until I need it. Like I said, I don't think you really need to, or can, improve on a simple roll of Scotch Tape, but this is a cute, handy, attractive little gadget, and it's been pretty useful sitting there in the corner of my desk. That's actually only half a roll ofScotch Magic Tape 3105, 3/4-inch x 300 Inches, 3-Pack1 package of Scotch Magic tape and the price difference for the convenience of pre-cut pieces is not minimal. I will stick with my old fashioned roll tape dispenser. I'm good with the standard roll of tape and the desktop dispenser Also while a regular roll of scotch tape lasts and lasts, this runs out very fast. I think I'm just going to stick to a regular roll of tape. With roll dispenser tape it took two hands to rip the tape and an elbow or chin (I get really creative) to hold the wrapping paper in place.
