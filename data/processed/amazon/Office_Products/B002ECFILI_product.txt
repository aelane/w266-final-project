It seems like such a simple product but try using sub-standard labels--you will notice the difference that Avery provides in terms of appearance and overall quality. The product name on Amazon product page did not say that the labels were WRITE-ON. Although, I wish the product name on Amazon included this very important fact.That being said, the labels work well. Great product which produces a professional, clear appearance for our over-burdened postal process... (Avery product number - 45280) Other than that, very good product. Avery Label Pad is a product that comes up all the time in our personal lives. Almost any writable product will work on them except a printer. It's a great and handy product! This product does what it is supposed to do. This product, AVERY TO/FROM SHIPPING LABEL PAD, 40 LABELS (45280), is a great solution for me. Avery is a great product. You know, I just love it when a product is (a) well-designed, and (b) does what it's supposed to. It's a little hard to come up with a compelling product differentiation for simple mailing labels, but this package managed to.I've bought labels before that became a mess in some drawer because you get 40 loose, individual labels. I highly recommend this product, especially if you ship packages frequently. I'm not sure if this is a product whose time has come, or more likely, whose time has already come and gone. Great product.
