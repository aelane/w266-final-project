All the software comes on an enclosed CD. I installed the entire software suite , which only took about 10-15 minutes. The software install included EPSON Scan, Presto! The CDs contain the required Epson scan software and a link to an online user guide, and three optional programs - Document Capture Pro, ABBYY FineReader, and NewSoft Presto! (Additional PDF software is required.) BizCard software, the user can scan business cards and convert them into editable text as well. I have upgraded the NeatReceipts software to the current version.The Epson scanner is fast and efficient. You can quickly e-mail directly from Epson's software and it will access Outlook quickly. The software can also automatically straighten the scanned image and you can also remove punch holes and such.The Epson software is pretty flexible but somewhat poor in terms of user-friendliness. While their software works pretty well, I do think Epson could clean up the software to make it more intuitive.I also like the fact that the Epson software allows you to scan directly to the cloud. Again, the software isn't super-intuitive, but once you've figured things out it's relatively simple.The NeatReceipts mobile scanner is quite different from the Epson DS-30 in many respects. Again, the software needs improvement in my view, but it works well once you figure it out.The NeatReceipts portable document scanner is inferior as a pure scanner, but it has some pretty sophisticated abilities to understand, sort and store data. I did use the ABBYY OCR software a few times, enough to conclude that you will get decent results scanning reasonably legible documents at higher resolutions (no surprise there). The software understood most of the common words for differentiating phone numbers (Office, Mobile, Cell, Fax, etc.) I installed the software which too a long time, I think close to 15 minutes or more. If you don't have any other OCR software, it works in a pinch. The software is a grab-bag of programs, with no central unifying control panel. software is so bad, it doesn't even recognize the scanner; the company is apparently based in the UK, and the business card reader offers Palm, Now Contacts, and Filemaker among its import/export choices. Good software really makes the difference in this case. The software installed easily (on Mac OS X 10.6.x), and though it's a bit clunky it does the job. The main software is very basic, you just open it and configure your scans. Instead the same software list that was seen on the prior screen is shown, at least for a while, before the setup process actually gets going and an installation progress bar is finally shown. BizCard 5 software install is the only glitch that I might note as that installation prompted me to again choose my preferred language and click Next to proceed. Now I get to go download updates to the installed software. After registering that software I return to the software and use the Help menu to check for Updates.

It does what I need and does it well when it doesn't have USB or software issues on the Windows 7 PC.

BizCard 5 - dedicated software for scanning and parsing the information on business cards.ABBYY Fine reader- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software used to convert scanned documents into editable text.The DS-30 physically resembles the NeatReceipts scanner.

I tried the DS-30 with the Neat software.
