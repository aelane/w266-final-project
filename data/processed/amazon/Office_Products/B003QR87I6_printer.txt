Well, it does what it is supposed to do, works in the printer, price was fine. I only buy OEM for this printer and 3 years later the pictures are as good as the one's in the first month! I buy all my OEM printer cartridges from Amazon. This Canon printer ink cartridge replacement pack contains four easy-to-use ink containers for your Canon inkjet printer that snap in or out as needed. Very happy with printer, by the way, which was a recent purchase from Amazon. I like that this printer takes separate color cartridges and I like that you can buy them in a collective pack; that is very convenient. In a proper printer (not Canon) this ink is actually good. My printer takes the 225 and 226 blank ink, but this does not have the 226. It ruined the printer beyond repair. My Canon printer works perfect using original ink. I would recommend this for your printer as needed. The printer requires 6 ink cartriges and these 4 are the primary color ones. My printer needs ink, and this is the kind it uses.
