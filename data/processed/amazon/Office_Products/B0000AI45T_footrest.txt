Now that I know what this footrest did for me, I'd gladly pay to keep it, even at a non-discounted price.Bottom Line? With this footrest's construction, you'll be using it into your Golden Years. Initially, I thought this footrest wasn't tall enough for me, but then I discovered that it was adjustable. After trying this footrest for a few days, I noticed a big improvement that I don't have that numb feeling in my feet at the end of the day.Normally, you only need to use a footrest if your chair height is not adjustable, or the seat is already in the lowest position but your feet still cannot fully touch the floor. I had a similar footrest in my corporate cubicle (made of plastic) and was happy to see this one made of steel. The 3M footrest is solidly built! This footrest offers all I could ask for.DesignThis footrest is wide and sturdy, which is nice if you adjust your feet position a lot during the day. Overall, I would recommend this footrest enthusiastically, especially over a plastic footrest at or near the same price point. We looked at it together and he said: "yes, it is just a footrest. This footrest was bought after extensive searching both online and in big box stores.
