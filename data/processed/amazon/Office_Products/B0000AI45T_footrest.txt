Now that I know what this footrest did for me, I'd gladly pay to keep it, even at a non-discounted price.Bottom Line? With this footrest's construction, you'll be using it into your Golden Years. This footrest is sturdy with a nice non-slip surface. Initially, I thought this footrest wasn't tall enough for me, but then I discovered that it was adjustable. After trying this footrest for a few days, I noticed a big improvement that I don't have that numb feeling in my feet at the end of the day.Normally, you only need to use a footrest if your chair height is not adjustable, or the seat is already in the lowest position but your feet still cannot fully touch the floor. I had a similar footrest in my corporate cubicle (made of plastic) and was happy to see this one made of steel. The 3M footrest is solidly built! This is one SERIOUS footrest! This footrest offers all I could ask for.DesignThis footrest is wide and sturdy, which is nice if you adjust your feet position a lot during the day. Overall, I would recommend this footrest enthusiastically, especially over a plastic footrest at or near the same price point. We looked at it together and he said: "yes, it is just a footrest. This footrest was bought after extensive searching both online and in big box stores. This is a great footrest, and I recommend it.T
