The markers are great - vibrant colors without a dry factor. The markers snap into place and stay firm, the eraser just kind of sits there and falls out. It comes with four markers (I'll never run out!) The markers do a nice job and while the eraser looks cheaply made it doe a much better job than I expected. The markers and erasers fit nice and snuggly in the Caddy and there is no fear of them falling out even when hanging on the wall.I am very happy with the Prestige 2 Connect Marker Caddy. It securely holds four markers and an eraser. It comes with Quartet markers but I think other brands will fit fine. The Quartet markers are very nice. These large markers are comfortable to hold and have bullet-point tips that provide smooth and precise writing. The markers work adequately.The eraser is different - it's not the usual shape of a chalk-board eraser, but instead it has a very slim head (6" x 3/4") - sort of squeegee style. Searching for markers is a real time killer. The markers that it comes with are great as well. I like upgraded markers that come with this set, though not nearly as much as theQuartet EnduraGlide Dry-Erase Markers, Bullet Tip, Assorted Colors, 4 Pack (5001-1M). First, the markers. Since markers run out of ink (and often do so fairly quickly in certain environments), the real issue here, at least for me, is the holder. The markers are vivid and write well. The markers themselves are fantastic - nice and dark and have lasted for quite some time! The markers in this set are absolutely top quality. If I were only reviewing the markers it would be five stars, but, unfortunately, the junk eraser and useless caddy brings the whole set down. The markers are good quality. The markers fit snugly in the caddie, the weirdly shaped eraser (it is about an three-fourth an inch but still gets the job done), not so much. Good markers, decent eraser, but the &#34;caddy&#34; isn't particularly good. The Quartet markers are always good, the eraser is decent and comes with replaceable felt pads stored inside, but it's got a very narrow erasing edge and would be incredibly annoying to erase an entire board with. I found these markers to be of good quality and I found the holder to be a convenient way to keep all the markers and eraseer together. The markers tend to perform better on thin crisp lines then broad lines. However, other than the markers themselves, everything feels very haphazardly designed.

Don't expect to be able to use it for your Expo markers!- The eraser does not snap in like the pens do.

The markers work surprisingly well, though they're made for a big wipe board and not a small one like people might have at home.

The markers are of good quality as well, so the whole package is a good deal.
