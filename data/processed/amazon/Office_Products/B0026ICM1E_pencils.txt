The KuruToga is not unlike the other pencils when it comes to shape/size/color and that's unfortunate. She's VERY hard on pencils and very picky. She uses mechanical pencils to do all her schoolwork and to draw as well (she draws manga). I first got into mechanical pencils while I was in college, so I have tried a few in my lifetime. Compared to other mechanical pencils, I don't see a noticeable difference. I think I'll stick with my "disposable" mechanical pencils. I have tried many mechanical pencils with the idea that I could erase errors. I use pencils primarily for drawing purposes but this pencil is so comfortable to use, I found it in my purse for note taking and drawing.I only switched to a pen when a signature in ink was a necessity. All pencils seem to be susceptible to the same issue such as lead breakage and constantly having to advance the lead.This pencil is one case where the maker's claims definitely hold up under use. I have a jar full of wooden pencils, with 2 or 3 laying on my desk within reach. Then again, how many wooden pencils would I go through before this mechanical earns its price? I bought this as soon as I heard of it since I love pencils. If you're into mechanical pencils, you might like this. I've tried a few mechanical pencils over the years and someplace here I probably still have my drafting lead holder and a set of leads for it.The Uni-ball KuruToga Twist and Turn 0.5mm Mechanical Pencil seemed to address some of the issues I've had with mechanical pencils, so I welcomed a chance to try it out.Previous Issues:* Stopping to advance the lead.The KuruToga Twist and Turn advances the lead automatically as you write. How does it compare to the more expensive pencils from other manufacturers? Mechanical pencils are among the many things that I used to collect as a young adult. I've been using mechanical pencils for longer than I care to remember and was curious to test Uni-ball's hyperbolic claims for this one. It's more comfortable than those yellow #2 pencils and the lead is darker. I hate mechanical pencils. I hate mechanical pencils. It's so frustrating that I gave up on mechanical pencils long ago. I am not big on pencils, but this one writes like a pen. I still love both of the pencils but I had to share the difference. I gave up on mechanical pencils because of the breakage issue since I apparently write with abnormal amounts of pressure, but I've been writing a lot with this pencil and the lead has yet to break. With other automatic pencils, it would have broke for sure.The KuruToga is quite comfortable to hold as well. I've used many mechanical pencils over the years, and I normally need to use a 0.7mm or larger one due to my heavy handedness. Yeah, pencils are about as low-tech as it gets. I usually use one of the higher-end Pentel pencils which has a sleeve that can retract. Of all the pencils I've ever used, this one is easily the most resistant to breakage. However, if you're experimenting with multiple pencils and don't mind adding $5.50 to the order, this is worth trying out. We usually buy a few nicer mechanical pencils every year for math at school, my kids love them and feel very grown up using them, and I prefer a mechanical pencil rather than a conventional pencil for my writing but lead breakage is always an annoying issue. I am particularly enamored of mechanical pencils. I use pencils for grading and recording grades. I get tired of sharpening pencils and was looking for a mechanical pencil that would be dependable. I love writing with pencils, but have always stayed away from mechanical pencils because they seem to break so easily. I have been using mechanical pencils for many years, as I prefer them to wooden pencils. It is more expensive than typical mechanical pencils but the higher cost is not unreasonable and I would consider well worth the cost. I usually don't like mechanical pencils because I apply quite a bit of downward pressure on them and the lead breaks all the time. Regular pencils seem to lose their point so quickly, and I have tried mechanical pencils, but they just seem to break leads even more often.This one did not! I've used .5mm mechanical pencils for over 30 years--mostly in writing and notating music. 2 pencils, and are frustrated with mechanical pencils because of the learning curve), and he did not snap it once.Pros:* strong, durable, sharp lead--the mechanism is brilliant* package includes generous supply of refill leads and two refill vinyl eraser tipsCons:* the barrel is much fatter than most pencils, and does not fit in a pencil loopRecommended! No more throw away mechanical pencils for me, and no need for me to invest a large amount of money in a heavy, metal pencil. I've been using Pentel Twist-Erase pencils for 8 years, so I'm pretty biased on the subject. Most other pencils are too thin for my larger hands. I use mechanical pencils a lot, and I have found this pencil to be far superior to most common mechanical pencils. If you use most common mechanical pencils much, you will find that the lead breaks frequently, or has trouble staying in place. I use mechanical pencils, but I rarely break the lead, so that feature is not as important for me as for some other reviewers. I prefer pencils and pens with metal barrels, instruments that have a bit of heft to them with a non-friable barrel.However, it is certainly not a waster of lead as are most thin lead, pencils and is a good tool, if you like lightweight pencils. Reviewing pencils has never been my strong point so I'll just list what I liked and what I didn't like. You will no longer need to buy the fragile mechanical pencils that are currently available in the market, because this uni-ball will outlast them all. I have always liked using mechanical pencils for their clean edges in making ledger entries so I have some experience with these. I am converted and all those other mechanical pencils are now retired! I use .5mm pencils both for drafting quilt patterns on paper and also for drawing lines on fabric.The very first time I tried this pencil on paper, the lead broke immediately. No, the disposable pencils don't write quite as clearly, but honestly I had never considered it a problem before.In any case, it's still a very neat pencil and you will definitely enjoy it. I rarely use mechanical pencils, or even pencils for that matter, but this is probably the best I've ever used. I am hard on pencils. When I use mechanical pencils, the leads break more easily than with a regular wooden model.The uni-ball Kuri Toga Twist and Turn Mechanical Pencil solves most of my pencil problems.
