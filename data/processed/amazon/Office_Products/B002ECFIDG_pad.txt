This is a handy little pad of labels which is good for hand-written labeling tasks. The pad of three-colored labels holds together and is stiff enough to write on. This is a very handy pad of labels of the type you would use for manila file folders, or just flat to label an item. ...this little handy-dandy pad of multicolored sticky notes in the post-it mold are quite nice. The pad idea for the labels is excellent, as they keep organized & compact. They are also easily removed from the pad itself -- none of that aggravating "fingernail work" needed to remove the backing from each label. These do not because they are on a pad with adhesive backs like post-its. The Avery Removable Label pad is another variation on the well-known Sticky-Note. Being in a pad is really helpful too! Handling the pad then becomes cumbersome if you want to keep the 3 units together.2. They are all attached together into one pad, which helps keep the labels organized.I found these simple to use and quite helpful with organization and recommend them to anyone who needs to label files. The little pad is perfect. This pad measures 3 inches by 3 1/2 inches and contains 120 labels.

The pad is cumbersome to use and a single label is hard to get off.

Each pad has mixture of all colors and if you use one color more than others, you will be left with lot of unused labels.

The pad design is great.120 labels fit in the palm of your hand and are easier to store than letter size sheets which tend to get creased and ruined.
