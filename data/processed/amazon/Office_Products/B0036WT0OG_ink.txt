And I love Canon ink for photography which is the only reason I have the color printer. HP ink with HP printers etc.The game is won by whoever dies the same day that the printer and all the ink go at the same time. Canon makes excellent ink and photo paper so this ink/paper combo is almost the best of two worlds, quality and economy. You DO NOT get the CLI 221 black ink which is required for the MP-560 and some other Canon printers. My MP 560 requires both the pigment-based and dye-based black ink cartridges (pigment for text and dye for photo printing). Purchasing ink in this combo pack is cheaper than individual cartridges and provides a free pack of photo paper too. It's great ink for a good price. I have always stuck with Canon OEM ink, because the results and reliability are worth the extra cost to me (plus printer manufacturers are making it increasingly difficult to use non-OEM solutions).However, the Canon PGI-220 and CLI-221 CMY Ink with PP-201 (50 Sheets) Combo Pack really doesn't make much sense. Canon ink just works so much better than any other brand I tried without exception. The Canon and its ink cartridges do just that.My complaint as I have stated before is the cost per page and the fact that the printer (MX860) requires each cartridge to be in place with ink otherwise it will not print. It's OEM ink and works great. I've used this Canon ink for several years and the ink units have always been dependable while giving good quality print on both letter paper and photo paper. So I'd rather pay a little more to buy real Canon ink. I use this ink in three different printers over about 6 years and I've never had a problem with leaking or defective tanks. The ink is clear, and dries fast. As with most ink, the cost is too high for the amount of ink and the number of prints you can get from each box.
