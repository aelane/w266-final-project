Overall, this is a pretty decent printer. Finally!Since then I've been favorably impressed with this tiny printer that could. This printer is very small and compact for a laser printer. As a personal printer it is fine and gets the job done. I love this printer. Sadly, this printer is no exception. The printer costs $60, and the toner refills also cost $60. This is SO annoying, and would definitely make me think twice about buying this printer. The printer is small enough I am able to take it with me in my RV when my family goes on trips. I received this printer as I needed a new laser printer. My old HP LaserJet 4P printer is like 20 years old, and its print is terrible and faint and hard to read. This new printer prints nicely dark and crisp. That's almost like buying a new printer every time ... It's good to have this printer if you don't need to print out everything you have. How cheap can a printer go?But when you see the cost on replacement cartridges you know something is wrong.Pro: it is fast. So I recommend placing this printer away from you so you don't get irritated by the noise.The paper holder is a bit difficult to load and adjust. For a sub $50 printer that prints fast and at a good resolution, if you expect a 5 star, this one comes awfully close.Recommend buy. Great little printer for the price. This printer is currently &#34;Under Review&#34; by Amazon. This Samsung ML-2165W is my first wireless printer.
