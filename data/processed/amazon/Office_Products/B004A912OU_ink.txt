Then I tested the ink smearing with a yellow highlighter. The ink does not bleed through - which is good. The ink doesn't smear if you give it just a second to dry. The ink flows well.The tube has a grip that is slightly groover, but not cushioned - I like that better because I don't like the ones that have the squishy rubber parts. I don't like they because the ink glops up and smears and they die pretty quickly. The ink flows nicely, more like a gel-pen than a basic ballpoint. The ink is good, smooth, and I like all three colors. The ink flows smoothly and I like that they are a ball point tip. I have to use black ink for everything. This will help to keep from getting ink in a pocket which has happened to me before. The ink does not bleed.In my Sudoku method, much erasing ensues with the penciled numbers (more so on Difficult Days than Easy Days). And if I've written in ink over the penciled numbers, I want the inked number to stay intact and the penciled numbers to go away. Too bad, because I really liked how smooth ink flows. I was quite impressed by how quickly the ink dries to the touch - no smearing. The ink does smear. Also, the ink is not completely smear-proof. Immediately after writing the ink did smear. The pen writes smoothly, the ink does dry fast, just as their ad promises. The ink is seamless and not spotty. The ink flows well and dries fast, producing little smearing. No wet ink to get on my hands or other papers when I shuffle them around.LOVE these pens! I wasn't able to lift the ink from the paper once it had dried, even with a wet eraser. The ink color on the pen body. As advertised, the ink does dry quickly, but not so quickly as to avoid accidental smears if you're writing quite a lot at once. I like that the ink in them is acid free, though I've no way to test its claims against fraudulent use.While I'm not a convert to rollerball pens, these are a good buy for the pen and ink type, as well as price. Writes well and doesn't smear, but I seemed to notice it running out of ink a little quicker than most pens. It just doesn't flow as well as others.- The ink is too thin and not as bright on the page as I think it could be.Otherwise, this is a solid pen. Being left handed I often end up with ink all over my hand. I also thought these were more of a regular ink pen versus a rollerball pen but they were still really nice to write with. When I tried to make the ink run by putting water on a piece of paper, the red ran almost indiscernibly, and the blue and black inks stayed put.This type of pen is really useful for jotting down quick notes since it rolls so smoothly. The ink is sharp and pens move easily on the paper.

I tested these against my Uniball Signo retractable blue ink pen and they both smeared when I ran my finger across the word immediately after writing it on plain paper (admittedly, this is not an activity I do a lot.)

The ink is smooth but not 'slippery' (like many gel pens).

The ink seems to be high quality and the pen itself has a nice grippy surface.
