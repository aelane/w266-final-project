It is hydraulically controlled to lift the chair to the height you desire, and it has a handy release mechanism that allows you to lean the chair back. My old chair leaned back no matter what and it leaned so you were always working in a leaning position.The overall look of this chair is first class. For a chair of this price range it looks top drawer. After saying all of that, if I could find a super comfortable chair pad I really would love this chair a lot. I don't plan on abusing this chair, but until I find the special seat cushion I am having a "Hard" time cherishing it. All of a sudden my chair feels a lot more comfortable. The chair arrived with one blemish/small hole near the underside of the seat; if it starts to expand I'll definitely come back and update.I'll take this chair to my work office and give it a real testing there. This chair has none, nada, zero. She sat in the chair and looked at me in disbelief. This chair has all the comfort of a stone bench at the park. I'd actually have to say this chair is more comfortable that the office chair I was using for several years which has padding that appears to be at least twice as thick as the seat and back padding in this chair.The space between the air rests isn't quite as wide as my old chair but it isn't uncomfortable. You need to slightly lift yourself to aide in raising the chair. I had no issues.The chair arrives in a large heavy, cardboard box. This chair is either a little too big or a little too small for me, depending on whether or not you think I should be able to sit cross-legged in an office chair. Overall, the chair is a nice balance of firm and soft, it rolls smoothly but not willy-nilly, leans back but doesn't make me feel like I'm going to fall, and it's easy to adjust. I think it's also more attractive than a mesh chair, and I like that it looks professional, but not imposing.Office chairs are pricey, but this one seems competitive. The chair came with a smashed up outer box. The chair had a couple damaged areas due to the fact there is not much cushioning in the box. A chair that is too soft simply won't work, and one without proper lumbar support creates aches. I've been using this chair for over a month and I love it.My back is comfortably supported and there are sufficient adjustments so I may customize my seating with an impressive amount of precision. I did find that because the chair is heavy, it required two people to attach the back to the seat. This isn't a chair that will accidently topple over. This chair is perfect for me and I am very pleased. This is the first HON chair I've owned. Then I connected the chair back and tightened the bolts. I sat in it and it is quite different from the chair I've been using. I still prefer my old chair, though, because of a better fit. I believe this chair will stand up quite well, over time, and would make an excellent chair in the role it was designed for.So as for me, I will be sticking with my current high-back, leather office chairs, but have moved the HON VL105 into a spare room, where it will be used by the family at a computer desk. I think this chair offers high quality and a great looking design for the money. As long as you are not looking for a chair that pampers you wish cushy softness, you may very well like the VL105 by HON.

As long as you are not looking for a chair that pampers you wish cushy softness, then you may very well like the VL105 by HON. This chair has a stylish, sleek, elegant, modern look.It was very easy to assemble.That is where the positives end...-- As others have mentioned the padding is minimal.This adds to the sleek look however misses on the comfort level.This is not a chair I could use for day to day 8 hour days work--  It lacks full adjust ability which is needed for good ergonomicsThe back is in a fixed position relative to the seatthe arm height does not adjust-- construction is not up to parThe bottom of the seat does not have a finished edge. You move the chair and the two wheels fall off. This is a beautiful chair not only in the way it looks but in the overall design. I don't really want a chair where I sit and get over-comfortable, I want one that is comfortable but keeps my body in shape to move quickly when needed.The chair comes disassembled but it isn't a big job to put together. As with any chair that costs more than a few dollars, i'd strongly suggest finding a retailer with a floor model that you can sit on before you actually consider buying. My primary chair is theSteelcase Leap, but I also have "guest" desks for other people when I need a bit of collaboration. The secondary chair used to be a cheap random purchase from one of the big-box office stores, but the "leather" was starting to peel and the chair was looking rather dilapidated in general.First impressions of the basyx chair is that it's not plush at all. If you're used to a very cushy chair, this will be quite a noticeable difference. I think this chair is particularly nice for people 5'7" or under because of where the headrest hits. It's important that your chair fits your individual build and personal preferences. This chair is narrower than most as well so I would not recommend this chair for large people.Our chair has a minor manufacturing defect that we were able to easily rectify.

Overall, this chair took less time for me to setup than any other office chair I have purchased.

When I first reviewed this chair I kind of came down hard on it only giving it three stars because although it was a great looking chair, the seat cushion is a little bit harder than I would like.

I looked into chair cushions to add on top of it, but decided I can live with this the way it is.
