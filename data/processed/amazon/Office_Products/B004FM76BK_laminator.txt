Since receiving this laminator a few weeks ago, I have used it to laminate a variety of paper items of all shapes and sizes and found it very easy to use. I picked this laminator up when I decided to print flash cards for my son. Having never owned a "personal" laminator before, I was unsure what to expect with this GBC 9 inch unit. I have been wanting a laminator for years. Great laminator, simple to use. I was pleasantly surprised with how easy, quickly and nicely this laminator laminates! I would highly recommend this laminator if you use it occasionally and keep it clean. This laminator was super cheap, and it was why I bought it. I've never owned a laminator before so I can't compare it to other models. This little laminator fits perfectly in a corner of my desk. What a great laminator! I recently reviewed a $150 Black & Decker laminator and gave it a negative review! This laminator produces good professional results, cost-effective, small footprint, easy storage,it's near idiot proof. Nice little laminator that works well enough using letter size 3 Mil pouches.The unit is ready to use out of the box and takes about 7 minutes to warm up.Once ready then place the pouch into the feeder per instructions and it takes about 30 seconds or so to pass through the unit.Remove finished product promptly and keep flat till it cools in a minute or so.When finished run the enclosed cardboard cleaner through the unit to keep the rollers clean.Pros: cheap,really easy to useCons: none really other than the slow initial warm up time Even uses normal laminator pouches, no need to buy some special order products, just pick up the basic type and you are good to go!

Even the best laminator will do a crappy job with a poorly manufactured pouch.
