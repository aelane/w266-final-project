I send a lot of packages and these worked perfectly. For those who ship a lot (through eBay, Amazon or for any other reason), these labels are definitely worth the price, as long as they are available through Amazon and don't incur a shipping price.Basically, it's much easier to print and peel these stickers than print, cut and tape a regular paper shipping label. So buy them if you ship a lot and want to save some time and hassle. I don't ship a lot, so one package will last me a while (probably a couple of years). But if you're shipping a lot more frequently then you'll want to get a larger quantity for sure.The only minor annoyance I had was that the instructions given to set the printer margins and to feed the page in a certain way did not work for my particular printer (Samsung SCX-4100). I ship a lot of books through [...], and their system is set up to easily work with these labels. I don't do a lot of shipping, so 25 labels will last me quite some time.So, overall it's a great product, with a one-star deduction for the price point. I sell a lot of books on AMAZON and send a lot of packets to clients--this is a great set of labels. If I sold a lot, I might be hesitant to incur such an extravagant cost, but for the occasional use, I think Avery's got a good thing going here. We do a lot of shipments with [...] and the labels I used before these were a full sheet of LABEL, which was cumbersome since the shipping label is only half of the sheet. They're easy to use, and if you ship a lot, incredibly useful.However, I had to knock off a star for the price - $13.39 for 25 labels? These are really convenient - especially if you do a lot of selling on eBay, Amazon marketplace, etc. It's a lot easier to just print out a nice label and stick it on a package rather than hand-writing something or printing out some paper and taping it to a package with tons of tape.
