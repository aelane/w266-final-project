The ink is not wildly expensive and they do have XL cartridges which supposedly have 2.5 times the capability of the regular cartridges. Additionally, I have already had to buy ink. Even non-epson ink is more than other non-OEM inks. However, be careful when loading the ink cartridges. A standard black ink cartridge is only $12.99 on Amazon Prime. We have found that the blank ink seems to go quite quickly.You won't be disappointed - try this printer. Epson claims the ink is waterproof, I haven't tested this out yet! As for ink, this uses single color and black cartridges. The ink does not seep all the way through the paper, but it does go in a bit. The ink reservoirs on this machine are SMALL and hence expensive. There are four ink cartridges you must buy. I'm constantly buying ink for this thing & lifting the hood.This printer is too obtrusive for wireless connections. The ink cost more, but it lasted for months. Buying ink cartridges is what makes printers expensive, so being able to reduce ink use is a money saver. I will probably use up the ink cartridges I have and then buy another printer. All I can tell you is the ink cartridges (4 of them) supplied with the printer are not standard sized cartridges. The ink dried very quickly. Currently the black, yellow and magenta ink tanks are just below 50% and the cyan tank is down to about 33%. I'm going to watch to see if there are the same ink issues as the Artisan 800 (can't print black if other print cartridges are out, cartridges dry out when not in use, uses ink like crazy). Either the ink cartridges supplied contain very little ink, or the software doesn't monitor the level properly. I was able to use the ink that came with the printer for less than one day before it gave me the low ink warning, and that was only with moderate use! And we all know that ink is the most expensive part of printing. You will buy ink. I really like that the ink cartridges are not as expensive as the HP cartridges.All functions work great, I scanned, copied, printed and faxed with no issues. The ink cartridges are about the same price as for my HP printer, if you buy the XL size, which save money. The ink cartridges are not inexpensive. The yellow ink has 2/3 left, which is surprising since the photos print a bit yellow. I thought it was out, but I checked the ink levels today and they were fine. It's noisy, wastes ink and isn't as good as the HP Photosmart C3180 I was hoping to replace (that one doesn't have a fax or auto feeder). It's not heavy, it's not awkward.Any ink is expensive. The more you print, the more ink you use.T
