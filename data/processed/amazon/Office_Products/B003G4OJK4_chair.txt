I was able to assemble this chair solo in about 15 minutes. Nice chair, highly recommended at this price. It's an ok chair, well above average for an office chair in this price range. It's odd for such a small chair to have such weight. However, the chair as of the second day of having it,not having used it yet, does not roll. It is like dragging a very heavy chair around. the chair went together in less than 20 minutes. best chair i've ever purchased and worth the price.

Then I came across this chair and decided after reading the reviews to take another chance.

How this chair wears will be the next step... it's Made in Taiwan, which tends to be better than Made in China, we'll see.Hope this helps and I'll update as I wear the chair!

I have had sciatica in the past, but with this chair I do not feel that sciatica ache.
