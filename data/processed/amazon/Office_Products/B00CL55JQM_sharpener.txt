This sharpener has a good, steady motor, and sharpens pencils pretty well under USB power. This sharpener takes advantage of that, while taking up a much smaller footprint than a regular sized pencil sharpener.The sharpening isn't necessarily the best but it does the job. This sharpener isn't the most powerful sharpener, but for sharpening pencils for casual use, it does the job. I'd say this is more like a battery-powered sharpener with the ability to be powered via USB because there's a good chance that I may misplace the retractable USB cord. I received a sharpener to review and I received a completely different model from IPOINT instead of the one above. Love the sharpener though--it's super strong and wonderfully engineered. As far as a sharpener goes, I really like it. This sharpener does a good job of sharpening pencils but I just didn&#8216;t feel it had the power of traditional electric pencil sharpeners. This sharpener works quite well. This was  a very effective, lightweight and easy to use sharpener but it only worked properly for about 5 weeks, so I'm downgrading the rating to two stars. This is an average sharpener, for occasional home or personal use. )The "draw" of the sharpener is that it can be run by either batteries or connection to a USB port. The sharpener also has a 6V DC in socket and you can either use an adapter (not provided) or a USB cable (provided). The sharpener itself is quite light and you some times have to hold it for it to work well. The electric UL sharpener I received works very well and the trap is easy to remove and clean. The sharpener handled the first four with a steady but slow grind. Generally a nice sharpener. I must have received the wrong sharpener as another reviewer stated, as mine was also not able to used with a USB cable. As I did receive a Westcott sharpener, I feel OK with putting a rating here, especially since I had to deal with their customer service department. )The sharpener I did receive sharpened a few pencils and then became &#34;stuck&#34; the same day we received it --we fiddled and fiddled with it, but it was dead. I struggled with my last sharpener which was battery-operated. I love that this sharpener can plug into my computer. Though the sharpener itself is bigger than I thought it would be, it works really well for sharpening regular lead pencils.Unfortunately, it doesn't sharpen colored pencils at all. So FYI, if you want a more heavy-duty sharpener that also sharpens colored pencils, you might want to consider the Curve Axis model.Otherwise, if you want the USB feature and only plan on sharpening lead pencils, the iPoint USB will get the job done. I like this sharpener but it is underpowered when used with the USB connection only. The sharpener was faster and sharpened the new pencil well. The sharpener itself is small enough for any desk and is great for young children to use since it is not plugged in. I absolutely love this sharpener, it would make a great gift. This sharpener does the trick in a pinch, but does not put the sharpest point on the pencil. Unfortunately, I cannot review the IPoint sharpener.... I did, indeed, receive the USB/Battery powered iPoint sharpener. I first plugged the sharpener into a USB Hub. I then plugged the sharpener directly into my PC. I found the sharpener to have the most power when used with 4 AA batteries [NOT INCLUDED]. Since the sharpener is somewhat inadequately powered by USB, I do not personally recommend this product. The sharpener works well. The sharpener works great.T
