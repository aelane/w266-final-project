This is the perfect size to leave on the kitchen island that used to be cluttered with dozens of Stickies and other small pieces of paper. I realize its cheap, but I would go up a size or up a price bracket so you don't deal with the frustration I did. It's a nice size without being too big or bulky. If you need a bigger size, Quartet also makes a (Quartet Chalkboard, 14" x 14", Wood Finish Frame (90006)). So far it work well - nice size  Chalkboard, 8.5 x 11 Inches with a modern adult  Wood Finish Frame. The 8.5 x 11 size is great, but the actual writing surface is 6 inches wide by 8 1/2 tall. Yet it is very elegant, despite the smallish size and a classical stying, even monastic, with the deep stained wood grained frame. The size of the board is actually 11 1/2&#34;. It fits in my Timbuk2 large size messenger bag, though it adds a bit of height.When ordering, please realize that this item does not come with any chalk or eraser.One negative on whomever designed the packaging--the product is five stars, just something bothers me about the packaging. I like the size, but not the look, and am not impressed at all with the writing surface. It is fairly small, about the size of a sheet of paper. I like the size and look of this chalkboard, and the way it hangs. It's durable and sturdy and it really does look nice.It's a good size, 14x14, plenty of room to jot some notes for the day, a grocery list, a memo or random thoughts. It's the perfect size to write quick notes, or draw pictures. A good size for posting quick notes or a menu for a special evening. It's just the right size to use in my motorhome and love to use it to keep lists My husband actually uses it so it works wonders LOL It is easy to erase and the square size is perfect for crafts. The size is good because it does not take up much space. It's just the right size for a person or couple to hold during a pose or to prop up in a baby scene. I did  not realize, even thought they displayed the size, that it was to be so small.
