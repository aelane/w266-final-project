It unfortunately isn't smart enough to know that you're scanning a legal document, so it ends up truncating the documents down to letter-size when it does the PDF conversion. The automatic document feeder has a swivel cover. Also this is a 2 sided document printer/scanner so the lesser model would require you to scan individual pages turning something easy with this machine into a nightmare with the lesser single side model. Therefore it will try to print a full sized document on 4x6 paper if you let it, and then you waste ink and time. I recently needed a new document scanner. It has an automatic document feeder for the fax - while it can hold only 10 sheets, that's better than the lack of ADF present on some of the competitors' models. But having the document feeder meant that I could put in several documents, scan them to disk and then separate the files at a later time.Printing on theEpson WorkForce 840 Color Ink Jet Wireless All-in-One with Fax (C11CA97201)has been very easy. It either can't print or doesn't print the entire document or the entire page via wi-fi. I wouldnt use it as a large document printer, a laser is better for that. It is really easy to scan a document and send it as a pdf e-mail attachment. Both the document feeder and the single sheet methods. I fed the original document throughADF and flatbed, and either way worked great and fast. B/W document on aplain white paper copying worked the way it should, and it was great, butwhen I copied yellow toned color document, the scanner did not recognize thepaper's base tone and copied as white. From both the automatic document feed as well as the document scanning tray, the copies came out off center. Love the document feeder! This is AWESOME as it means that if you have a Word document to send someone, you don't have print it, put it back on the printer and fax what you've printed. *** Color document printing looks completely professional, even in areas of color transition or gradation. *** The automatic document feeder on top makes your life a lot easier since you don't have to keep raising the lid to copy each page and you can send a whole stack of pages as a fax.SUMMARY:*** It REALLY is an all-in-one unit. The automatic document feeder even lets you load multiple documents to scan! It doesn't just scan the document then print out as many copies as I want at normal printing speed.
