This stand was attractive to me because I was looking for something that I could easily roll around the studio and would hold a lot of supplies. This stand arrives as a flatpack that needs assembly. This stand is heavy and sturdy. As expected, the stand arrived in a flat container approximately 30 inches square by about 3 inches deep. But it's going to remain fairly stationary, so I'm happy with the stand. Once I got it assembled the stand is pretty solid and doesn't wobble for me, it looks nice and the casters are large.Now for the gripe-- talk about hideous assembly. This stand has the type of design that was intended to be assembled once. The stand has wheels for easy movement from place-to-place.The stand is attractive, though I notice that the table top seems to like finger printers. This stand is sturdy and provides two shelves to organize your items below the printer. The assembled stand is sturdy and rolls around just fine.2. Screw holes correctly lined up as they should have, and once the stand was fully assembled it's rock solid and sturdy...except for the casters.I can't for the life of me figure out how to make the casters (rollers) permanently attach to the bottom of the 4 table legs. Overall not a bad stand, but not quite perfect. If you ever get it assembled, you'll have decent stand. This stand being 20" x 26" x 26" can fit most printers and scanners not only on the top but on the inside shelves. This sturdy stand freed up a lot more desk space than I expected and I love the fact that it can be mobile or locked into place. Push them in as far as you can and then set the stand upright and push down firmly and they will pop into place.The finished product is worth it. Overall, a good stand to use with multiple purposes. The stand looks great and has plenty of room for storage on the shelves below. This stand fits the bill for me.
