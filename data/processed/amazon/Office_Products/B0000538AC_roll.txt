Hard to get off the roll, breaks easy, gets yellow all problems not happening with this cheap stuff. It pulls from the roll and tears off well on the cutting teeth. I usually take the roll out and put it in a weighted tape dispenser, so I can't comment on the roll dispenser it comes with.Scotch is my go-to brand for household and packaging tapes, and this is one of the styles I buy plenty of in the fall for all year use - Christmas, then birthdays, Mother and Father's Days, etc. Give your little kid a roll of tape and let him/her play with it. The single roll of the gift wrap tape apparently has much more on it that the three rolls here do combined. I actually used a whole roll of this on packaging up small boxes for shipping as well as bubble mailers. It's not altogether clear when on the roll, but when you stick it to paper, it almost completely disappears. This is a continuous roll of very thin plastic, and one side of it is tacky (sticky). The roll is housed in a hard plastic container, which has a serrated cutting device at one end. If you press firmly, it's even more difficult to remove.The roll of tape is 300 inches in length -- that's 25 feet.

I had a "regular" single roll of Scotch Satin Tape and the tape on THAT roll was at LEAST three times the diameter of the tape on each of these 3-pack rolls.

(The single roll also has the advantage of having a stronger case -and is sealed on both the front and the back.You can't go wrong with the quality of this product, just with the amount of waste, and the amount of tape you get for your money.Recommended as a single roll.

Each roll only has 300 inches of tape - compare this to a a Scotch Magic Tape refill that I had sitting in my cabinet that was 1296 inches long.
