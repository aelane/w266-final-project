They look neat on the fridge and they're convenient for writing down sudden thoughts or grocery items. They are pretty and brighten up the fridge. No more post-it's on the fridge or forgotten messages. I have mine on my fridge and I gave the other to my daughter. Magnet is strong enough to cling without slipping downward when the fridge door is being used.I did test the dry-erase marker and found it would wipe off the white textured steel refrigerator door, if marks were accidentally left on it.Sometimes we like to leave a note to each other as to where we have gone, or just a silly `I love you'. I stick one one the fridge and other on the main door and write down things as I remember. We put these up on the fridge and they are great little message boards. They both stick to the fridge very nicely. We put these up on the fridge for &#34;to do&#34; lists and grocery lists. She can carry it around and write on  it, then stick it on the fridge. They stick firmly to the fridge and are easy to write on and wipe off. I use these on my fridge, and they do very well. It is magnetic, and can say on the fridge or somewhere else. Very easy to stick onto your fridge.
