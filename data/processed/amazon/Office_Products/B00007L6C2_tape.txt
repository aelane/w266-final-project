And even though the tape is easy to tear across its width, it is impossible to tear this tape with my hands across its length, which is what I would hope and expect.So why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5? But without using the tape from a dispenser, it usually quickly sticks back onto the main roll of tape, requiring you to look for the edge and lift the end of the tape off of the roll using your fingernail. As with tearing the tape by hand, this lifting of the loose end using your fingernail can wrinkle the tape edge or corner again, possibly resulting in the tape not sticking as well.So while not needing a dispenser or scissors is very handy for quick or frequent taping tasks, especially if you frequently mail packages, I personally prefer using a dispenser as it gives me consistently straight edges and it does not cause wrinkling of the tape edge either due to tearing this tape by hand or due to picking at the tape edge using my fingernail to pull it off of the main roll each time. However, if you're shopping for packing tape, you're probably just looking for function - and this stuff has it in spades.I've been using Scotch mailing tape for many years, mostly using their dispensers similar to the one linkedhere. The tape is quite strong until you're able to apply force across the width of the tape at about a 180 degree angle, so I think it's unlikely to tear once applied.I don't mind the dispensers and actually find that they help get a straight line of tape on a box seam, but for anyone looking for the same caliber of tape in a tear-by-hand version, I say look no further - this stuff works. This tape is easy to use, no scissors needed. The tape is crystal clear,reasonably thick, and tears easily with both hands. This is important, because otherwise the tape would rip as soon as you put pressure on it. What this means for you, is that when you are tearing the tape, you can easily tear it as many times as you want one direction, but you'd need scissors to rip/cut it the other direction.I think this tape is a wonderful addition to any household. I have been using Scotch tape products for as long as I can remember but this, Scotch Tear by Hand Packaging Tape, is the first clear tape I have purchased from Scotch that doesn't include a tear- off bar. With this tape, you simply select a tape size of your own choosing, hold the edge, and tear it manually, without the aid of a serrated cutting bar.I like being able to tear by hand and this feature is a nice change of pace from other packing tapes, which often include a pertruding, metal bar needed to cut the tape. With traditional tape dispensers, it is easy to grab and begin a new piece of tape because the tape is ready to go at all times- all you have to do is lift up the tape, from the cutting bar, pull the desired length, and then tear it across the cutting bar. I use packing tape to seal packages and to tape down table cloth covers. This tape works just as well as regular packing tape for both situations. The tape keeps my packages sealed and holds down my cloth table covers in outdoor wind.If you don't like using a tape gun and find yourself fighting with standard packing tape, this tear by hand tape is a viable option. I haven't used this tape a lot yet, but I do find it handy to have around.It's a fairly typical packaging tape, good grip, but can be torn by hand. After trying this tape, while I still feel more secure with a heavier packaging tape, I believe this would be a very good (but also very expensive) alternative to pay for that convenience. I would NOT use this tape for heavier packages in ANY of those circumstances (especially moving), but for small to medium-size bubble envelopes and packages up to a few pounds (3 or 4 at the most), I would use this tape and have to admit being able to tear the quantity you need by hand IS a pretty cool convenience. This tear-by-hand tape continues that tradition. Overall, I don't think I'd purchase this tape myself because it's more expensive than the regular stuff, and there's no real advantage to using this over the regular stuff. I was a little concerned that "tear-by-hand tape" also meant "tear-during-transit tape". This tape is just as strong as any other packing tape, and while it requires a little strength to tear the tape, it is definitely effective to tear off a piece.One nice thing about a tape dispenser is that, besides cutting the tape for you, it keeps the end of the tape pulled away from the roll so you don't have to use your fingernail to pull out a new piece every time. However, with this tape, I was pleased that the act of tearing it by hand stretches out the corner of the tape a little bit, making it so the corner is really easy to grab when you pull out the next piece. This tape truly is usable without a tape dispenser! And as I said before, I am very pleased with the tape's strength. And it's as strong as the regular tape versions, i.e., the versions with a holder/slicer. I didn't have to use any more tape than usual.This seems to be a bit more expensive than packing tapes with the same strength that aren't "pre-sliced." This is great tape to have on hand when you don't have a regular packing tape dispenser handy. As much as I love playing with a tape gun, I really don't need one anymore. This tape pulls off the roll with ease, then you just tear it like you'd tear a piece of paper. If you hate dealing with packing tape with a dispenser, then you will love this tape. Tearing the tape is very easy too. Whenever I'm applying tape and I do not have one of the dispensers with a serrated blade for cutting the tape, I end up using my teeth. That led me to use more of this tape as compared to other, more tear-resistant, tape when sealing boxes. This tape does deliver on its "tear by hand" promise and it works as well as the Scotch traditional packaging tape.Scotch Packaging Tape, 2 Inches x 800 Inches, 6 Rolls (142-6). If you only use tape infrequently or if the cost is not a consideration you would be quite happy with the performance of this tape.Update 3/21/2014 I still had some of this roll and when I wet to use it for shipping a package I found this tape has lost most of its ability to stick and easily peels off so it is useless now. It is also slightly more expensive than "regular" tape, but the convenience is well worth the extra effort to find it and the extra cost. This tape doesn't stick to itself like crazy, which is a nice bonus. Love this tape! For me, I actually LIKE the dispenser-type tape, even though it takes up more room in my drawer. This tape actually does tear easily, and seals well. They've therefore come up with packing tape that can be easily torn by hand. The tape itself is 1 7/8" wide. But since the tape is "bulkier, it doesn't seem to have quite the adhesive power of the plasticized tape. Here's where the tape gets interesting: it appears to be designed to tear only in one direction, perpendicular to the edge of the tape. This tape is great! No more struggling with the packing tape on that sharp blade. I used to use a full on tape gun but that was messy and I found I wasted a ton of tape. Though, you can still get cheaper packing/shipping tape from other brands. I picked this Scotch Tear-by-Hand tape to review from the Amazon Vine program (thanks) because its description caught my curiosity. Packaging tape that can be torn by hand? Doesn't that mean this tape can be broken easily due to wear in the mailing process?It turns out that my worry is not warranted as long as I use this tape properly. All you need is to make sure that the tape has decent lengths on the two vertical sides at the two ends.With this tape, however, you will definitely want to use two more pieces of tape to seal the two edges where the first piece of tape wraps 90 degrees around on the box. I don't have to worry about the tape curling up on me, or the scissors failing me at the last possible second, I can just tear it by hand and place it on the box. The tape is really easy to use, since you can tear it by hand. The tape seems to be thinner then other mailing tapes, though, and it did not stick very well to cardboard boxes and was really easy to remove, which might mean that the package, especially if heavy, might burst during mailing. I usually use tape dispensers, but I feel wasteful when I don't buy refills and instead just buy a whole new plastic dispenser. Apparently, tear-by-hand Scotch tape has been around for years. It was.Roll the tape across the package, hand tear it and it is sealed.I sure wish it was cheaper. The tape tears easily, unlike, say, a bag of Fritos! This tape is ambidextrous! I don't see how this tape can be as strong as the old stuff, but I don't have a test lab. And we won't be cussing at the mailing tape any more. I'm really loving Scotch's Tear-by-hand tape, especially during this holiday season.I have yet to find anything that it doesn't adhere to. And surprisingly it is really strong tape, it doesn't just rip super easy or anything.Only issue I have is the width, it's the smaller 1.88" and not 2", thus it does not fit in theST-181 Tape Hand Dispenser. This tape eliminates the need for a jagged metal strip, which is generally a good thing. It also seems like this tape is stronger than the packing tape I use. So when I saw this tape was tear by hand I had to give it a try. This tape is great to use as you can tear it by hand anywhere you wish. It's the tape that counts. Now, we have a tape that can actually be torn without any difficulty. Regardless, I highly recommend this tape and will buy more later. Great tape, I love using the Scotch 3M brand for my clear tape for packaging.I never liked the tape guns and always stuck to the scissor and apply method.Decided to give the tear-by-hand a try, and love it.It's so much more convenient, finding the tape edge is much easier (though I use a tape placeholder now), and ripping it after applying is 10x easier and much faster.The tape is still just as strong, although feels a tad bit more stiff (which is why it's now easier to rip).Only downside: width and pricetag. I seriously didn't believe that it would be possible to easily tear this tape with just my hands. It turns out that this tape is incredibly easy to tear by hand. I found this tape to be a bit more adhesive than the regular Scotch packing tape that requires a dispenser to cut it. This tape is pretty impressive for the following reasons:- No dispenser is needed- It tears straight by hand- It is pretty easy to remove if needed yet has adequate sticking powerSince tearing the tape by hand requires slight dexterity and strength in the fingers, those with arthritis or the elderly with limited hand strength might find it difficult to tear. I found that this tape performed as described; it is easy to tear by hand and seals packages. When I seen this tape, I have to admit I questionsed it's strength. Any tape that you can rip with your hand, I mean really; is it going to keep my packages safe and closed?This is the best tape. This tape is easy to use and sticks well. Packing tape usually comes with a dispenser with sharp edges to help cleanly cut the piece of tape. I have to say, I really love this tape! I get so tired of the normal tape dispensers that keep losing the end of the tape, this stuff just WORKS and it's easy to lift up the end of the tape, pull it out, and rip off what you need. This tape certainly fits its description -- you don't need any tools but your hands to tear it. You just need to realize this is NOT cheap tape and that it's only for the occasional shipper. You just pull down against the tape and it easily starts to tear and does so in mostly a straight line, so the product certainly works as advertised. Generally speaking, I go through enough packing/mailing tape to use one of the dispensers and keep it stocked with the larger rolls. The tape itself is fine, good for sealing boxes or packages, and it's nice that you can tear it easily by hand, so that you don't need scissors to cut it, but I think it does need a dispenser or something, because the tape is clear, so it is easy to lose the end, which you will need the end for the next time you need to use the tape.I ended up putting a flag at the end of the tape, so that I wouldn't lose the end.I also would have preferred one larger roll, instead of two smaller rolls. And this tape is no different. I don't waste tape because I got it stuck together trying to tear it. Absolutely top-notch tape -- nice and thick, adheres well, and is easy to tear by hand (I'd tried a tear-by-hand tape about 5 years ago when I first noticed the product, but that tape was a lot harder to tear -- I think they have improved it a great deal.) Mind you, it's not going to be as easy (obviously) as masking tape it to tear, but it's easier than most duct tapes.One disappointing thing? I was shocked when I got it that it looks to have about 1/3 to 1/2 less tape on the roll than the picture shows. Packing tape dispensers make it pretty simple to secure boxes for mailing or moving, but I often find myself wanting to just grab the tough tape and tear it. It was hard to imagine that tape could be both strong and torn by hand, but all became clear after using it. Tearing across the tape is really very easy. Obviously, packing tape is best used with a dispenser or tape gun. But if you don't have one, it can be very cumbersome to manage the tape roll, the box flaps and the scissors all at once. Seriously, how do you review tape?IThis is the best packaging tape ever.

Because the tape tears so perfectly across its width (due to some molecular magic at 3M), if your package has any give to it, and is given a sharp punch/push where the cardboard flaps come together - for example the UPS person dropping another box on top of yours - the an across-the flap piece of tape just tears right open.

Does not happen with conventional tape.

Since this tear-by-hand tape is longitudinally strong, tape placed lengthwise along the seam should be fine.For medium duty work, I think this tape is OK (although expensive), and is great for around kids, since you don't have to worry about them getting cut on anything.
