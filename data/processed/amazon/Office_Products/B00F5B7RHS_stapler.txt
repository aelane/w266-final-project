This is a cute stapler that any girl who enjoys a little sparkle in her life would like. This is a Swingline stapler so it is a good product as I have used these staplers for years. Also, the stapler did not come with any staples. While I suppose it is unique in that you can decorate your stapler, honestly, I would not pay to purchase this product. The stapler is a good size, nice flat top and holds a decent amount of regular sized staples. It's a basic black and purple stapler that is very light weight. Also, the stapler doesn't open up all the way so you can't staple things to the wall. The stapler is plain black stapler, with a purple trim. Depending on what you&#8217;re looking for, this is an adequate stapler for infrequent use or light stapling jobs. This is basically a stapler that comes with sticker bling. The stapler itself works great. I like this stapler. It sits up as high as a regular stapler, but it is much shorter. Once you put it on your stapler it tends to slide if you touch it. As far as it being a stapler - it works as it should. Also, I cannot imagine that this stapler can possibly staple 20 regular pieces of paper as the manufacturer promises.But, it has a very solid plastic body, it easily staples 10 pieces of paper and I do like the fact that you can stand it on end so that you can grab it quickly. This is a decent stapler as are most made by Swingline. I love this stapler. It is the first stapler I have ever owned that hasn't grown legs and walked away. As a stapler it is a perfectly functional one. It is not designed specifically for the stapler. The stapler is not worth $14.99, but if you can get it for under $10 it's worth the purchase.I also have theScotch 3/4-Inch X 350-Inch Shoe Dispenser with Magic Tape, Blingwith accompanying jewel stickers (I got it for $5 in a Staples). They can be easily moved around or knocked off when using the stapler. It is a small, colorful, lightweight, plastic stapler. This Swingline Bling Fashion Stapler is an usable stapler for those needing a replacement or simply wanting a new fancy product. Or maybe a stapler which won't &#34;walk away&#34;.The bling dots are OK, but you could easily buy better at most craft stores and create a lot of fun. The stapler itself is basic, works well and like normal. I needed a stapler that I could identify if someone took it from my desk at work. It's a good stapler though. Lightweight stapler that didn't include even a starter strip of staples. It is a standard stapler, not really meant for excessive use. I got this customizable stapler mainly because the stapler on my desk at work always goes missing and now that I used the stickers to put my name on it, no one takes it! Despite this, I am still very pleased with the stapler and highly recommend it! It's a decent enough stapler. The stapler did not include any staples. The stapler itself is fine. This stapler works great and yes I tested it on 20 pages. The stapler itself is a lightweight plastic stapler. This stapler works great. The stapler was a small, sturdy, plastic Swingline about half the size of a full-size stapler. When I then stick it onto the stapler with its gem, it leaves a small amount of sticky exposed. But the stapler itself is stylish and has flat surfaces that are more amenable to being decorated. This is a great stapler and Swingline is the brand to buy. I obviously did not purchase this stapler for its function but its looks. You have to decorate the stapler and unfortunately, mine did not turn out so fashionable. This stapler is fun and is good for a teenager who occasionally uses the stapler as a novelty. Overall, I give this stapler four stars. First off, this stapler works exactly as it should, loads correctly, hasn't jammed in the week I've been using it and uses standard fare.The stickers are the issue.
