GREAT idea! The idea of having a bar of sticky adhesive along both the top and bottom of a sticky note is a good one. I really liked the idea of these Post-it notes, but they could definitely be improved. Great idea, just not executed well. I think the idea of the product is not only that it'll stick for longer but that its' supposed to prevent curling. The idea may sound great at first. It seems like a great idea, except that these sticky notes are some of the worst I've ever dealt with. Honestly, I applaud their great idea with the second adhesive strip but I cannot ignore the failure of this product nevertheless. It was a good idea that didn't work out in practice. The idea behind these notes is great... a sticky note that actually lays flat so it won't get caught on something else or get bent or fall off. The idea is great, but the product is not suited for use on regular paper, maybe just for thicker stock like folders or binders. However, this good idea is undermined by the mediocre "sticky"... it just does  not stick as well as  Post-Its. However, if I'm using them horizontally and not vertically, they work pretty well and don't curl up as much.A nice idea, but the sticky side needs work. Have to say that while its a great idea -- In practice, the paper needs to be thicker or something to actually lay flat. Overall, a nice idea but with poor execution. I think the idea of a stay-flat note is better than the actual implementation of the idea. Almost a good idea but I didn't notie a problem before this fix. The idea of having a sticky note with both top and bottom adhesion sounds like a wonderful idea. The idea behind the Lay Flat Sticky Notes was a good one. What a great idea! The idea of a notepad with a bit of light adhesive along one edge changed the way a number of us handle office tasks, and those notes are good for situations where they are not likely to come into contact with other material that might peel them off. Avery has improved the idea by placing a second strip of adhesive approximately two-thirds of the way across the back of the sheet. The idea is that with sticky at the top, and sticky at the bottom, the note should lay flat.
