When trying to remove other labels, I have always had a few layers of the folder removed or sometimes torn completely. However, I am happy to find these labels live up to their name. I tested these labels on a laser printer with no problems. Having labels run through the drum makes them curl and the likelihood of a label coming off and becoming stuck is high. These labels were surprisingly useful when I recently organized my various hanging folders at home. Also, these labels have purposes beyond folders. The restickable labels solve that problem. The labels are easy to peel off from the backing, but they won't come off accidentally while being printed in the laser printer.I downloaded the template file (3M Template 2100-H.doc) for this label from 3M's website and first tried to test print on plain paper. I print out labels on the printer with these, but mostly use them for handwritten labels for file folders. With the Post-It labels I can just label the folder quickly by hand and go! These labels are very handy, and accurately named - Super Sticky Removable. These labels are a godsend. I previously used regular labels and always had to scrape remnants at the end of the year. These labels are for Laser and Inkjet, 25 sheets, 30 per sheet for a total of 750 labels. These labels are removable which allow you to label your files and at a later date remove your old label and replace it with your new label. You'll find 750 labels here... enough to last a long time. I can print labels with my name and address and place it inside the cover so if anyone borrows the book, they'll know it's mine! With these removable labels, there'll be no mix ups! I decided to put these labels through the tests to see what they would really do over a little time.I set some of these up on some folders that I keep for work related things and kept a few in the back of the car (seeing as they have to travel with me all the time) and the rest got left at home.So far I have been pretty satisfied with the results.The labels themselves seem to work fine for the most part even after the last couple months of being in the car and indoors.labels kept in the car:Even after having them in the car for the last couple months now the labels came off BUT not all of them did so easily. I had several labels stick almost as bad as the ones that I kept in the car. So it seems that these labels really don't care where they are kept but you will still have troubles with them even after keeping them in a controlled environment.This was disappointing. So I noticed that on the labels, it showed that Avery compatibles were available. Otherwise, check out the "Permanent Adhesive" labels, which are probably only for institutions with client folders, project folders, etc. It is useful and helpful to be able to reposition the labels easily, and they are quite easy to print on. These labels are not only a good idea but they work as claimed!Not only do they stick securely and remove cleanly, as advertised, but you can write on them by hand with practically any type of writing instrument or use a laser or inkjet printer. The labels are as advertised super sticky, but they do remove cleanly. I picked up these labels because every school year we go through a ton of files and subject dividers. These labels are the perfect solution and a wonderful alternative to tab dividers. The labels have a matte finish and neither ink nor print smear. This was serviceable but not efficient, especially when I'd accidentally move or misplace a note.These labels are quite different. These neighboring unused labels do stay put well enough for me to use when making handwritten labels.As for the repositioning? I've put labels on file folder tabs, moved them a day later and again several days after that with no problems -- and no worry about them falling off. These labels use the Avery 5366 template which can be easily found on MS Word or Corel Wordperfect for alignment of the printing. These labels are even handy for sticking to my laptop to jot down quick notes: names, titles, or whatever. Love these labels! And I used the labels with a laser printer, and it came out great. I got these labels thinking they would be great to resurrect some old file folders I have, to cover up the old labels and make them look more organized. These labels are really too narrow in height to cover the older type file folder labels, although I find they work great for labeling the hanging files themselves (with tax categories, etc. These labels ought to be very useful to anyone who goes through bottles and has to fill them up again.Another thing I'm dying to try, but don't have the equipment for it yet, is doing sous vide with contents vac-sealed in mason jars. These are labels and they work well. Something about having printed labels makes makes my filing system feel much more legitimate, and makes me much more likely to actually use it. These labels are a pretty straightforward concept, letting you print labels from a computer instead of using the little 1 at a time labeling machine I have been using.-Stickiness is excellent, and I've had no issues attaching to folders made from plastic or paper, with various levels of wear or previous label residue-Peeling has not happened, even in a relatively warm environment-Reusability is an awesome benefit. Since these are Post-It labels you can take them off, move them to another folder, or do whatever you need to without printing a whole new label.-Page size is a bit odd, since they are slightly wider than a normal 8.5" sheet of paper. These labels have been great for organizing not only folders, but storage bins that I have where the contents tend to change occasionally. The labels are a dull white and are easy to write on with Sharpie or other implements. But frankly, given that these are not intended to be permanent labels, a quick handwritten marking on the label as to its purpose is likely to be sufficient. The labels are a matte finish, which is fine, but I like the look of shiny labels on my file folders that I keep on my desk. These are neat labels for those folders that are used for temporary contents. The labels stick to file folders and appear to be permanent, but when I needed to remove or readjust them, they didn't leave traces or rip which was what I had experienced even with other "removable" labels. The Post-it Super Sticky Removable labels kick it up a notch by allowing you to remove them from file folders as well as other items.First of all, what a value. You get 750 labels, which comes out to $0.02 per label. For these labels, you can use the Avery 5366 template in Word. When you need different labels on a sheet, you can just download template 2100-H from Post-it's website. I own both of them and they use the same templates.The Post-it Super Sticky labels do just what they were intended to do. I hadn't fed labels into my laserprinters for many years as I had bad experiences with jams in the past. These labels just work. I think I will finally be able to stop writing my labels by hand! Are labels worth reviewing? So far the labels have stayed where they are supposed to when they should, and when I've needed to move them there hasn't been a problem.You are able to see through them, but that is the case with all labels that I've ever used, so I don't see how that is different. These labels stick on securely but are still easily removable. These labels are great for organizing and studying. That's a LOT of labels! Who is standing around eagerly awaiting to write/print on labels, peel them off, and put them on a file folder? I use these labels at work to label my manila folders, which we have to reuse after time. If these labels will indeed pull off easily, as they do now, they'd be mighty useful. Using permanent labels naturally peels part of the cardboard off, if in fact the label does come off in full, which it rarely does. I tend to only print a few labels at a time so I need to reuse the page to feed thru the printers again. Traditional labels can lose its adhesiveness after moving it around a few times, or paper rips... I used to use permanent labels on my file folders... If these labels remain removable after a lengthy period of time, I would be completely sold on these labels!- Compatible with inkjet and laser- Easy to locate templatesCons:- Not free- Once you start labeling, you may not want to stop.One remaining question is whether it will remain adhesive/removable over time. These labels are GREAT! We print labels on our InkJet printer to label bottles for my daughter's daycare. These labels stick great but then peel off easily without leaving a sticky substance on the bottles. I found these labels may be removed easily within a few minutes or up to two weeks after application without leaving adhesive residue. The labels retained adhesive so that they could be repositioned multiple times which I liked a lot. I like these labels because you can remove them. This is going to make me more confident in adding labels to my files, my notebooks...pretty much anything! I really like these labels. The labels stick securely and as the envelope says can also be removed quite easily (I wish they used labels like this on flowers and other gifts). There are 750 labels in a pack, so at $15 through Amazon, 2 cents each seems reasonable. Most of the labels I was sending had four and sometime even five lines of address information. These labels only hold three without reducing the font (not advisable) so I used another Post-It product for that. But they work really well as standard labels too - they don't come off unless you try to peel them off.I think these are pretty amazing. So the removable labels are great. If you don't need to reuse labels and want to make sure they never come off, these aren't for you, though. I really like these labels. Not with these labels. Avery labels on the other hand are almost universally integrated into MS Word's template libraries and indeed, I used the compatible Avery label template for my test printout with these labels. I particularly like that these labels not only adhere nicely to plastic bins, but they also stay put. With these labels, we can put her name in the book without having to write in the book, and removing the label causes no damage to the book. I pulled off a few of the labels to straighten them out and they could be repositioned easily enough. I have been using the Avery removable labels for over a year now. If you have used Avery labels before you won't be disappointed in these, which are a better value. Since these are removable (non-permanent) labels, I'm not sure how well these will stay on in the long term, but for now they work great! These labels solve an age-old problem:  File folders are easy to reuse, but when you try to peel off typed labels, you usually tear the tab of the folder. It's great to be able to move labels from file to file. No more half-removed labels and junky adhesive remnants on folders or binders! I had given up on using labels and had started just handwriting on file folders because, invariably, I would change my mind about what I wanted a file name to be or I wanted to reuse the folder/binder for something else and I would end up with five layers of labels or a mess of adhesive and half removed labels.I figured the removable adhesive would not be as strong as the one used on permanent labels. These are very good labels. I used these labels to label it in various categories.I
