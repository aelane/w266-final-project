I've used this ink a couple of times and I haven't noticed any difference from the original ink that came with the printer besides this ink lasting longer from the look of things. Highly recommend this ink, especially if you do a lot of printing. I always hate buying ink because I feel it's just way overpriced, but with this kind of quality and price, I can actually print everything I want and not worry about either the cost or running out since now I have plenty on hand. You can visually check the ink levels in these cartridges because the cartridges are transparent.After a certain amount of use, the chips started to report lower ink levels, but the levels were very inaccurate. I am more than willing to purchase the ink to keep it going. Luckily the two that didn't exploded their ink into their packaging before I even got to them. I bought some ink form this supplier and when it arrived there were 3 units that had been damaged in shipment I sent them a message within 10 minutes they had completely refunded my money, I have bought from them 4 times so far and they have won a customer for life, plus this ink works much better and longer then the Canon brand name Inks out there which acutely has a alcohol base liquid in them so they are designed to dry out faster so you have to buy some more... I have used these ink cartidges for over a year without any problems. I love these ink cartridges. But the ink I have bought has been as good as the factory ones and so I'm likely to buy these again.

After using only two of these ink cartridges the printer started printing everything with a green hue.

I bought another one and tried this ink again, thinking that the first time might have been a fluke.

This inks works as well as the Canon ink does for a fraction of the cost and seems to last longer.
