I've used this product in a smaller size for many years and have total confidence in its holding power. EXCELLENT product, simple and easy to use. It is a very good product. To make the product perform well, I would highly recommend that the surfaces are fairly smooth, clean, dry, and warm -- warmth especially during the initial installation are important. Once the product is applied, there is little chance of repositioning, so be careful when you apply it. But, once I tried this product, no more falling frames or letters! This is a pretty easy product to use - simply mark the item you wish to mount, cut strips of the mounting tape to place on the markings, then attach to the surface you are mounting on. best product. Sometimes this is because not enough of a product was used. Another great product from 3M.Used this on several picture frames, as well as a small shelf. I have used this product in a variety of environments; in the garage where the tape is exposed to sub-zero temperatures and in the attic where the temperatures can reach 110F or more. I was glad to review this product. Nice product, recommended. This is a great product to use anytime you need to stick up something at the office or home.
