These note tabs are great for studying, as you can write on them (some pens won't though), and you need to be careful not to put them on thin paged books, such as older Bibles and such, as you could tear the pages when pulling them off, but for most books, they are just fine!I LOVE that you can add tabs to pages (I may just put one at the beginning of each book of my Bible for them to be permanent!For most text books I have, the width is perfect to cover the text, so you can highlight over the text, which you can see easily AND the matte finish takes out the glare too!You can either use the entire sheet, or tear the perforated  lines to make smaller areas to highlight. She used one note tab for every chapter. A regular "sticky note" would work almost as well for a whole lot less money - you'd just have to lift it up since you couldn't see through it like you can with this product. I really like these note tabs. In short, these note tabs do what they're supposed to do. I have definitely enjoyed using these new note tabs by Avery,  This version has three tear-away panels that you can utilize as better sticky notes for your organizer and as addition notes for a certain topic or task. The Avery note tabs come in a variety of colors and are translucent. If I want to write on my note, I'll use a yellow note page, and if I just want to mark the page, I'll usually use a flag. I like these note tabs, but I would prefer that all have the "tab" part.

You could make a note and stick it on your car dash.

These note tabs are a great quality at a great price.They are durable, useful and help labeling with two colors.I have used quite a few of Avery's labels now and am very satisfied with their quality and recommend these labeling products highly.

Instead of just six.But overall, these note tabs do the job for what their intended to be used for.
