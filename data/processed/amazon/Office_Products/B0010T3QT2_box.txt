The box that these envelopes comes in does not mention tamper-proof features, so perhaps the Amazon item description is incorrect.The glue on these appears strong and the printing on the inside successfully conceals content. I buy a box of self adhesive #10 envelopes about once a year. My box of envelopes do not mention anything of the like.SUMMARYMost 40 count safety #10 envelopes cost about as much as the Quality Park Reveal-N-Seal envelopes. The box of 40 Reveal-N-Seal Business Envelopes brags that, "No moisture required! I'm not sure I'd buy another box though, there's just not enough wow factor or upgrades from my usual security envelopes to justify the difference in price. The box is made of thin cardboard, and it was smashed and torn on arrival. I was surprised to find that my box was marked "Made in Germany". The box contains 40 envelopes. When the box first arrived, I thought these were just generic brand envelopes. I used one of the 40 in the box as a test sample but did not see this feature when I tried opening it.The not-so-plus points: There are other ways to determine if your envelope is the victim of tampering, mainly, just looking at it. Looking at the box I see no note of recycled content. If this sounds picky, perhaps I should say that a box of business envelopes might well last us six months or more. The box just says 'Reveal-N-Seal Business Envelopes' and basically looks to be regular envelopes with a long-lasing adhesive, not tamper-proof, tamper-revealing envelopes. Although the box makes no claims of having special tamper features, the description does. The box says nothing about how you determine if the envelope has been opened. This is my first box of Reveal `n Seal, but it certainly won't be my last. I probably would not buy anothe box just because I worry about the postal machines tearing thin letters.
