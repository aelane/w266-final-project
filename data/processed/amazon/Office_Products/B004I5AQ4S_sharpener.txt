This is a great sharpener. I wanted a small portable sharpener. That sharpener was great and had a lot more power than this one, even though it does not have the greatest reviews on Amazon. The sharpener does a decent job of sharpening but is a bit herky-jerky.In order to throw away the debris, you pop open the clear plastic top by squeezing the sides together. Overall this is an alright sharpener, nothing spectacular. You have to wonder if you'd be better off with a manual sharpener. If you were looking for an everyday sharpener, this is too small and weak. A good electric sharpener does the work for you, eliminating much of the inconvenience that makes people avoid using pencils in the first place.The Stanley Bostitch Minisharp Battery Powered pencil sharpener is, unfortunately, not the good, convenience- enhancing pencil sharpener I was hoping for. I took out the sharpener, inserted the batteries, stuck in the pencil and it sharpened it. This little sharpener gave each of them a perfect point in a matter of seconds, much better than manual ones might do. I don't think even a $50 sharpener does well on colored pencils.Negatives that can't be corrected ... there is one hole at the top so your pencil better be "just the right size". You'd be much better off with those little throw-away, pencil sharpener razors.

The sharpener is black plastic with a clear window for the sharpening mechanism and shavings collector.The not so good:No accompanying instructions.

A great little sharpener, highly recommended.

It looks more like a sharpener you might get at the dollar store, cheap plastic.
