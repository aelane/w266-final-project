This is a wonderful set of pens. This set contains all the colors of the rainbow, plus brown, gold, grey, silver, and black. This set of gel pens has some fluorescent, some metallic, pastels and deep jewel tones.They write smoothly without skipping.Gel pens I've used in the past dry out much faster than regular ink, so I'll update if this happens. We were both really pleased to see that the set provides not only a fantastic variety of colors, but also contains regular inks, metallic inks, and sparkly inks, which adds a lot of visual appeal to any project.I like this set so much, I'm tempted to purchase a second one so my daughter and I each have our own. This set has everything you could want when it comes to gel pens. This is a nice set of multicolored pens that you are sure to find the color you want. OK, this is a nice set of gel pens. This is a great set of gel pens. This set strengthens my love for gel pens. It's the perfect set for a scrapbooker, cardmaker, doodler etc... I absolutely love this set of 44 Tekwriter USA Gel Pens. This set is worth the asking price, especially considering my set arrived with two extra pens, for a total of 46, and each one with a full ink reservoir for lots of quality use! This is a great, multi-purpose set of gel pens. This would be a good set for kids.
