I like all the colors except for green (alittle to much on the pea soup side for my taste) This is the reason for the just 4 stars. And it is in assorted bold colors! The colors are bright, especially the pink which is slightly darker than the others, yet text can still be read and written easily on each of the colors. The colors are pleasing, and they provide a nice variety (instead of the boring yellow we are used to), and my pens seem to write on the notes very easily.No reason not to recommend, especially if the price is right. I like the colors. love these colors, the stickiness of them and the writing surface.I am a big fan of "sticky" notes and these are great.I use them all day long at work and also for my own use, shopping lists, to-do lists etc so I have used all different kinds.These are probably the top of the ones I tried. I love the colors ! The different colors make my desk look bright and cheerful and allow me to organize different notes. The colors are not washed out -- not are they too strong to make writing with a blue or black pen hard to be easily red.400 sheets.. a years worth of notes.. a good deal. The colors are pleasing to the eye and you can readily write on them. Nice bright colors mean your note will be noticed. We have found that the various colors are really nice for catagorizing or color coding appointments and notes for different members of the family, or for highlighting the type of appointment. The colors are bright and bold, but light enough not to impair legibility. The colors are cool and sherbety! The colors are sharp and pleasing to the eye. The colors are eye-catching - the notes stick to smooth surfaces (desk's, papers, and even refrigerators).No complaints whatsoever - I highly recommend this product!All the best,Jay Bold colors for sure. The colors are strong, so they are eye catching. The colors and the height of the cube make it a lot harder to lose at least until it is almost gone. The bright colors are a plus for an eye-catching reminder. I am ok with the bold colors and the added box top for my son's school is a nice touch as well. I like that these have bold colors and stand out. Perfectly sticky, not too much not too little.Bright colors so you can see at a glance.Now I won't run out for months! Bright & Happy colors!What did we do before these sticky notes and little reminder tags were invented? Bright colors (gone are the days of bland yellow post it notes), but as another reviewer noted, it would have been a lot better if the sticky notes alternated in colors rather than doing big blocks of color changes (blue, pink, yellow, green). I like the colors in this particular pack and the 3 x 3 size is just right for me. I absolutely love the bright and vibrant colors because they are attention getting; the paper is a little thin and if you write in marker, it bleeds through the other side, but overall a good product. To me it is cheaper, has great colors, and works better. I also love the colors that they come in. I like the bright colors, and I use the different ones to make priorities on pending tasks. The vibrant colors were even better on arrival than in the picture. I like bright cheerful colors for my notes and these fit the bill.
