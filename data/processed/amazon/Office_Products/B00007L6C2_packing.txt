I was very skeptical when I saw this Tear-by-Hand packing tape. Some clear packing tapes pull off in ribbons and you can never get them going full size.Perhaps the large size you could put on one wrist and have the hand free I don't know as I said my review is of a 17.4 yard sample roll. This is exactly what it purports to be -- an excellent packing tape (always had great results with Scotch brand tape and adhesives) which can tear by hand rather than needing scissors, teeth, or a dispenser. I'm not sure I'd use it for long-term packing and storage, but for shipping it seems to be just fine. Wow, I must say I was impressed with this packing tape...I was a bit skeptical at first, that packing tape that could actually be torn by hand, would be easy to use AND effective. If it tears easily, how will it be good packing tape to seal a box, or if it's effective as packing tape, how can it be easily torn?? Most of my packing tape needs are crafty, not shipping. Looks just like regular clear packing tape. With my regular packing tape the pads of my fingers are sore after wrapping, as it feels like every time it sticks to my fingers it removes a layer of skin.I love this stuff and will be buying it in the future for smaller jobs or for when my kids are using tape.

While conventional packing tape is super strong and I can seal small packages or large storage boxes quickly and economically with a gun, I was curious about this tear-by-hand product as even I have gotten some nasty cuts from the serrated cutting edge of a tape dispenser when I wan't paying attention.I received a small sample roll to review as part of the Amazon Vine program.

If you're familiar with the packing tape used by the post office for Priority Mail, that will give you an idea of how easy this tape is to use.

If you are using a packing tape dispenser and normal packing tape, you can do the same job in less time and with less tape.
