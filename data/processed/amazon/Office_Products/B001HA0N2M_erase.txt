I have used them on a dry erase easel, and they work fine. These dry erase pens work AND they're slim enough to carry around, if necessary.I carry a small bag for my job so this feature is terrific. I use a dry erase calendar every month and i was looking for a fine point dry erase marker. You get the most basic dry erase marker colors-black, red, blue, and green- but the colors are bright and easy to see. These are fine dry erase markers that write very nicely and fine. I like dry erase board for sharing ideas and reminders. My dry erase board came with markers and to my surprise, they all dried out within a couple months. They don't smell strong like some dry erase markers do. I've been using the other EnduraGlide dry erase markers in the classroom for the last month, and have been loving them! These are perfectly decent dry erase markers. They write on a dry erase board without a problem; they erase easily, and there&#8217;s no weird offensive odor with them like you find with some dry erase markers. They are great to use on personal dry erase boards which my son uses to solve his math homeworks. We use dry erase boards in our house to help organize a lot of things so we're very familiar with them. These dry erase markers are definitely not the worst markers I've ever used nor are they the best. They are very easy to use and don't smear on a dry erase board. These are great dry erase markers.

These dry erase pens are -- as you can see from product image -- are black, blue, green, and red.

Thus they work great for me on my smaller dry erase board (11x17 inches) and being fine point leave more room for actual text on the board.

I use them on my small dry erase board in my office and they've performed great.
