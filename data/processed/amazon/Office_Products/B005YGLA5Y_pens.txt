These pens are "fat," the size I prefer to hold. This leaves me with special pens for writing my grocery lists and the like. These are good pens, but I would not buy special colors for such a purpose. These pens came in two pretty colors, pink and purple. I don't think that I would go out an specificately buy these pens unless they were for a certain purpose as they aren't really practical for most things that you need to write with a pen for. I definitely see these pens appealing more toward younger teens than someone older though. These pens are beautiful, feminine, have a comfortable & cozy fit, and writes smoothly.These retractable ball pens, medium point are dainty, practical, and pretty. They were excited to get the pens; they love them.Now I will have to buy a pack just for me!Highly recommended. I can't recommend these pens for "serious" business purposes, as the inks are purple and pink. I love pens. I want pens that are not only useful, but attractive as well.These retractable ball pens are both useful and attractive. Even though I love pens I'm not sure I would not have paid $6.00 for them just for myself. I love these two pens, pink and purple. These pens have a soft 'cushy' feel to them and don't fight my hand. I am very pleased with these pens and as they also come in black and blue, I will be ordering them too.These pens are MINE... not that my husband has ever expressed a desire to own a pink or a purple pen, but once he writes with them... who knows? Having tried and disliked theBIC Cristal For Her Ball Pen, 1.0mm, Black, 10ct (MSLP101-Blk)I wasn't sure what I would think of these pens, but I was pleasantly surprised. They've become my favorite pens and I've never had to worry about them disappearing.I've actually picked up a couple as stocking stuffers for friends who used mine and got a kick out of them. These pens are so pretty with some white patterned decorations on the top and middle. Most pens come with black ink and that is it. The pens make it more fun to take notes, they add a little pleasure to the day. Although not as important to me, the pens have a pretty little design on them- it's on both the main barrel of the pen and even etched into the metal near the tip. I love to collect and use all different pens. These pens are nice because not only do they write well, they are pretty too. These pens are pretty colors in pretty packaging, which is unnecessary, but kind of fun. These pens are comfortable to write with. Overall I enjoy these pens. Not only that these pens are wrapped with weird bubbly gem stuff material.. which is great, but not in reality. Apparently these pens aren't so "fashionable" as marketed. I guess these pens should've been around when I was younger so I could have better penmanship.. thanks for nothing bic. The pens are nice and write smoothly. I'll stick with my unisex black & blue pens :+) I've been using the pens for a couple of weeks now and I must say that they are very nice to write with and I like the comfort end that cushions your fingers as you write. Great pens. These are the nicest pens I believe I've ever used! I am going to look and see if these pens come in black. I really like these pens because of their comfortable grip and the way they write so smoothly. The pens are pretty thick, which makes them both easy and comfortable to hold and write with. I personally like pens that are retractable because you don't have to worry about losing caps (and getting ink on other items in your purse or pocket). These pens do write in the ink color of the pen. They closely resemble other BIC pens but are perhaps a bit thinner. I really love these pens. The pens themselves are comfortable to hold, too. These have basically become my new go-to pens, and I am extremely happy with my purchase! These pens fit well in my hand, some pens feel to thin around and I feel like I grip them to hard. These pens are great if you're looking for a little fun when you write in not a professional capacity because the ink is in pink or purple.Appearance:They are cute w/o being childish with a classic vine-like pattern in white near the middle/top & embossed at the silver bottom tip. been known to have pens that skip A LOT & were only used if you had nothing else & yet you still complained as it skipped when writing. Why pens that are beyond the basic type have to cost so much, I don't know. The pens write smoothly and clearly, with no smudging, even from my left-handed self. The pens also have a nice heft to them, without being so heavy as to be cumbersome. I got these pens because I liked the outer design. But after writing with each of these pens, she expressed a high level of excitement, due to the fact that the pens don't just have pink and purple bodies, but also write with pink and purple ink.My wife has noted that the software finger grip is a nice touch, although there are quite a few pens on the market today that include that. Everything about these pens screams woman. She stated that these BIC "Fashion" pens have just the write tip size, and that they write very well, with no faded or blotchy inch spots.When I asked my wife for her final verdict, she said 5 stars all the way, and that she will be highly recommending them to her female friends and family. I really liked these pens because they are stylish and feminine with a white victorian design on the pen's body, a jeweled top, and even etching on the silver part of the pen bottom. I'm 27 and have to admit that I love using these girly pens, so surely they'd make a great gift for younger girls. These pens are great. I LOVE pens, honestly. Granddaughter loved these pens. These pens are basically the same pens but are pink & lilac colored. I did find these to be comfortable, well designed pens. The pens have a nice design, but I am not a big fan of the ink. Great pens, especially if you would like a more feminine writing utensil. The two pens are color coded so you can easily identify which is the pink and purple ink. !All in all, I find the pens exceptional and can give them no less than......Five Stars and......a big Thumbs Up! These pens are cute and feminine, but they are really no different on the inside than a regular pen you get in a larger pack. They are just bic pens made girly. These pens seem of good quality and are pretty with their swirled pattern on the colored upper plastic and the silver tip. I really like these pens!

These pens are great, very fashion, when you write it fells so good, so smooth you don't want to stop or change the pen, the colors pink and lavender are beautiful, and the retractable feature is comfortable to use, I definitely will buy these pens again.

I was totally surprised to find out that these pens have purple and pink ink instead of the expected blue or black ink.
