When I opened up these name tag labels, I wondered how they could be any different than name tags I've seen and worn before. If you're looking for name tags--these really are a great choice! I used them as name tags for my students. These are neat name tags. I printed up name badges for the whole family and we wore them for an entire day -- even the two-year old. No more handwritten name badges. I highly recommend these name badge labels. These name badges are a real improvement over the previous series. The name tages can be seperated from the sheet without taking off the back glue protector. These specific name tags have just the right amount of stickiness to stay on, but can also be used a few times while still maintaining the stick. Great for name tags or for labels in a pinch. Unlike most name tags that tend to curl away from clothing, these are flexible and bend with clothing. These Avery name badge labels are a real step above the "Hello, my name is..." labels we're all very familiar with. I never thought I'd say that a name badge would be really cool, but this product is! I occasionally have to make name badges for a group that I lead at my church. I have tested these name tags for a 2-day weekend period (removing the name tag at the end of the 1st day) and they hold up great. I recommend these name tags and am confident in all Avery products. I ordered these name badges because I thought they might be suitable for more then one kind of project.Yes, you can use them as name badges, and it's nice that you can peel them off the sheet by either the front, for more of an individual use, or from the back, like punching them out, if you need to do more then one badge at a time.The writing surface on these is large enough for more then a name, since the labels themselves are plain white. I guess comparable to other name badges. I haven't worn that many name badges in my lifetime to really compare.I wanted these in part for labeling sheet protectors, where I label the front of the sheet protector, usually by year, but there is room on the label if I want to add more information.There are 160 name badges, so more then enough for more then one use, for many projects.It would have been nice had they had some decorative border, to give them some personality, instead of just plain white, but then the way they are, you are only limited by your own imagination.Another reliable, multi purpose product from Avery. But name tags are also great for things like RPGs where you want your players to interact as their characters not themselves.

The ubiquitous name badge is a staple of meetings and other gatherings.
