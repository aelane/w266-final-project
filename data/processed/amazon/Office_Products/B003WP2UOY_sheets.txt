Because it can only punch through 12 sheets of paper at a time I think it is best suited for home use, as the demands of office use may be too much. So while it will technically punch 12 sheets at a time, it functions best with 1-7 pages.The quality of the hole punch seems to be good, and I'm sure to use it for years to come. I tried 10 sheets of paper and it went through clean and it didn't take too much effort to push down. This one however easily goes through ten sheets at a time. Put in 12 sheets, get 36 holes. This punches 12 sheets effortlessly. Does up to 12 sheets at a time. Low-force Design - works - punched 12 sheets without hurting my hand or having to exert a lot of pressure to operate the handleStorage - being able to lock the handle down makes storage easier.

It will punch through 12 sheets of paper but I don't recommend it just because it is a bit difficult to get all the pages lined up so the hole isn't slightly off between the first page and the last page.

It does what it advertises: it cuts through 12 sheets of paper easily.

I never punch 12 sheets at a time, but did for testing purposes and it punched through with ease several times.
