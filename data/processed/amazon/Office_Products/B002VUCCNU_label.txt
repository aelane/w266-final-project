I was concerned that the adhesive label might come off while making the hairpin turn in the innards of my printer, but so far they have come out of the printer just fine (11 times). I would expect Stamps to work fine since their label and receipt system is almost identical to USPS & eBay.All and all, a great purchase. I have always printed my label out on plain cardstock, cut the label out, then taped it on, covering the all the label except for the barcode. At roughly $.50 per label, even with the Amazon discount, these labels are too expensive to mess with for the professional mailer. This is a PERFECT label for me. Previously, I either printed out a mailing label on plain paper so I could also print a receipt for me to follow-up and check on the status--but then I had to tape on the mailing label; or I could print it on half sheet labels but not wanting to waste them I would not print out the receipt part and then had to write info down on paper to follow-up. That comes out to about $0.54 per label. I created a US Postal Service online shipping label through eBay/PayPal and the only thing I had to do was to place the label in the paper tray. The label came out perfectly centered on the label half, and the shipping instructions and receipt printed on the paper half. This is the perfect label size for printing USPS Priority Mail labels. The label is sticky and sticks to the box/envelope without need of extra tape. Some of the label's I've used before had adhesive top and bottom. At over $.50 per label, this is far too expensive. The label portion goes in first, with the label side facing you. When printing using a full sized label sheet, half of the page with adhesive is wasted. With the Avery Shipping Label with Paper Receipt, print the label and you are left with a thin paper slip for your records.

I'm always worried about placing the label when the label first comes off of the printer, and we've had a couple of labels curl up.

I am delighted that Avery has produced a letter-sized label that has two parts - the top half is a sticky label for shipping and the bottom half is plain paper that tears easily with a perforation.

to see if your label is oriented correctly.The only minor complaints I have deal with some of the software (these little annoyances and can be worked around) and that the labels don't adhere to shipping tape all that well.I would say this is a must product for anyone shipping packages out of a home business, or even a small business that does limited shipping.
