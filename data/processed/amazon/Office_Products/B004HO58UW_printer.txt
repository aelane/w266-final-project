A great printer, having used many Epson printers, I am definitely sold on these Canon all-in-ones. I had the printer up and running about ten minutes after I opened the box -- on the network, configured for faxes, and stocked with paper and ink.For wireless use, you must install the software on each machine that will use the printer. It seems to be a nice printer; I only have two complaints with it. We just won't buy a printer that is missing the duplex feature. The printer worked like a charm for tens of thousands of copies with perhaps two or three paper jams over the entire three years. So when it died we were happy to seek out a similar printer from Canon.The MX870 would have been the closest match to the now obsolete MX860, but for just a few dollars more this MX882 had a few features we liked, such as higher resolution printing and scanning, and faster throughput. On the older printer we did use the fax sparsely and it worked fine with our traditional Verizon and AT&T; phone lines. Further I think the printer was interfering with our voice calls, causing them to drop. It is the only printer in operation in our house with a total of four computer using it.We go through a 5,000 sheet box of paper about every six months so it is in heavy demand. Great printer -- but in the long run will cost a fortune, particularly if you have any substantial printing to do.If the HP reviews weren't still so bad -- I would dump this Canon and go back to HP in a heartbeat.Really pissed! I love this printer! The printer is now recognizing the router.Edited to add 11/03/11: I've just recently got Verizon Fios for internet, phone and TV and I've noticed that my printer is now having a hard time maintaining a connection to the Verizon Fios router. This printer rocks!Edited to add 06/18/11: I have also been using this printer to print wirelessly from my iPad 2. If you don't have a HP compatible printer for Apple's Air print IOS feature, then this printer will work with the use of a printer application from the Appstore. I use Printcentral and it works flawlessly with this Canon printer!I have gone through several printers over the past few years because they usually just completely die on us. We needed another printer in our home to go along with the one we currently have so I decided to once again give the all in one printer another chance and I'm so glad that I did! This Canon printer is absolutely amazing. The printer's scanner feature works really well. I tested the printer's copy feature and let me tell you that the quality of the copies were outstanding. The printer is hooked up to my phone line so that I'm able to fax so I haven't had any issues with the fax feature.I love the color LCD screen especially all of the user-friendly menus. This is an excellent printer for any home office and I highly recommend it. I also tested the printer by plugging my printer directly to my laptop using a USB cable which made it print a tad bit faster. The printer also doesn't come with a USB cable. This is also fairly large printer; it is almost too big for the nook above the monitor in my computer desk. Shut the printer off and back on. Hmmm.Behavior when interfacing to the printer via wireless is also not very reliable. I have been using this printer for a few months now, and I am very pleased. I purchased this printer after using HP printers for the last decade. So far, I've been very satisfied and would highly recommend buying this printer. The printer set up nicely and the wireless part (nothing is EVER easy when it comes to wireless) went off without a hitch. If you buy this printer I hope you are as happy with it as I am and thank you for taking the time to read my review. I have now had this Canon MX882 wireless all-in-one printer for about 2 weeks (October 2011) and am a very happy camper.It replaced a Canon MX860 that had been used on a daily basis and always functioned flawlessly until it stopped working after 28 months of use (Error Code 5C20 - apparently a defective logic board, not worth repairing).This is not the fastest printer available, but it performs noticeably better than its predecessor - the MX860. Canon printer ink is good stuff as far as I am concerned. Canon will be getting all of my future printer business unless something unexpectedly and significantly better comes along.
