Canon has packaged this printer in a very nice and tidy package as everything can be closed up and kept neat with dust build up being minimal. I am using this printer as a business desktop and for that purpose it is an excellent purchase for the price. Not anymore as it's not workingThis is my first and last Canon printer I'll ever own, this is completely unacceptable. I bought this to replace my HP AIO printer because the HP software was a nightmare to manage. This printer has served us well for the past couple of years. This is my sixth printer, and I've never been more satisfied with a machine. I say this even though I've just recently gone through an MP-610 and the MP-560 (a later, slightly more compact printer (my offense was to continually overload the tray with excessive sheets, leading to occasional jams and much user hostility while disassembling the machine to tear loose the paper jams).So it was time for a new printer. I was not impressed.But then I noticed a printer way down in the sales rankings, apparently discontinued yet available at an affordable price if purchased directly from Canon.

I have a MacBook running Leopard OS and this printer set up was easy  and the prints are great.

I have owned this printer for close to two years now and a few days ago I got a B200 error telling me to contact customer support.

I mostly use the printer for scanning and I have printed just a few times since I bought it, this is a home printer with a very light workload, connected to a surge protector, etc.
