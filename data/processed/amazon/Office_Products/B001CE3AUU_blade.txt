When the blade is sharp it is quick and efficient to use and providing you have replacement parts it is the way to go if you are putting together a manuscript or sizing photos.However the bad points revolve around the need for replacement parts. I also have an old fashioned blade cutter that I have used for years and have never had to replace anything. The blade on that cutter self-sharpens and is ready to use all the time.Because my old cutter works as well as the new Swingline and the Swingline requires purchase of replacement parts I gave it 4 stars. I am so impressed with how easy it is to use this rotary blade trimmer. I love that the blade is totally enclosed to prevent any accidental injuries. I haven't needed to replace the blade cartridge yet, but that appears to be easy to do and the there is an indicator that changes color when it's time to do so.When I first saw the box, I was afraid the trimmer would be too large, but after removing the trimmer from the box, it's large enough to be easy to use, but small enough to not take much room when storing it between uses.

The blade's handle moved freely and easily went through what I was doing. Even on the old hinged blade style cutters, I've had things get pushed some if you did too many papers at once, even less than "recommended". You don't have to keep limping along with a dull blade until you can get it sharpened but you have to keep buying new blades which may not be always be available. The cutting blade is definitely sharp and especially great for trimming. Yes, the blade will eventually dull and need to be replaced.
