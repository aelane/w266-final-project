Basically, the printer worked fine with the cable, but as soon as I would unplug the cable and try to print, I would get a message that necessary pieces of Epson software were missing. I wish this printer had those same safeguards to protect users against making mistakes like I did.Two other minor issues are: 1. Epson could have included the A-to-B (printer) USB cable. The printer has plenty of easily adjustable settings so that you can change resolution, dark/lightness, magnify, etc. If you plan to scan from the printer itself (meaning you walk up to the scanner and push the scan button) you will need to be hooked up to a computer via a USB cable. This is by far the most attractive printer I've seen. This Epson printer was a breeze to set up with my mac. Overall, this is a very capable printer of delivering on its stated features, however, the menus and operation leave much to be desired. This is usefull if the printer is in a different area than the pc and you need to charge it. I've never had a wireless printer, so it's really nice to not have to run up to the office every time I want to print. !Overall, I'm happy with this printer and would recommend it as a great addition to any home office. All in all this is a very good All in one printer, unlike my Canon, this printer also has Fax capabilities which I have been missing on all my printer until now.Printing,The printing on this is very fast, and much faster than my Canon. The printer has a standard scanning bed like most other printers, but an added bonus is it also has a top mounted scanner auto feeder not unlike the printer you may see at work. Also like the printer you may see in you office you can scan multiple pages at one time which saves a lot of time if you need to scan multiple documents.FaxingThis printer also has faxing capability and its pretty straightforward. I I highly recommend this printer and it should serve you well for years to come. I've owned a WorkForce printer before (Epson WorkForce 520 Color Ink Jet All-in-One (C11CA78241)) and that model was a disappointment. That's really what it's all about.Hopefully I'm not jinxing myself by praising this printer (because my experience with the 520 was so bad), but after two months of use I'm very satisfied with it. My existing printer is an HP 7100 series all-in-one. It was then easy to add it as a printer on both my Mac desktop and MacBook Pro laptop. I'm probably going to end up with a printer cart that will hold both the WorkForce 635 and the HP 7100. This printer has a nice small footprint. Otherwise, this is a great all-in-one printer for the money. I also own a xerox printer that is extremely durable, way faster and not flimsy. I've been wanting a printer that connects to my network via wifi. I wasn't sure about this printer however, since it's an all-in-one. I can't say if that's really true since I haven't used the printer long enough, but I think it's a great concept.I'm happy with the printing that this machine has done. It's still more convenient than a printer that isn't connected to the network, though. This printer is just about perfect.One feature I haven't seen mentioned in the reviews is this: one doesn't need a computer to copy or scan. This printer can be used as a stand-alone just by pushing a few buttons on the panel. I highly recommend this printer. I can still scan in PhotoShop, or manually scan from the printer into the computer, but I can't initiate a scan or fax from within Windows. My previous printer was an HP, and it took up more space on the desktop. The printer is nice looking--the top is polished black, while the body is mostly a matte black.I ran into a few glitches when installing the software. Wow, I love this printer! It's replacing my previous all in one printer, that was about 7 years old, and in desperate need of an upgrade.Very easy to install, My main computer is using Windows 7, and then the other computers on my network are using Vista and XP, and no problems printing. My previous printer wasn't able to do that, and it's not a feature that I typically see in "cheaper" models.Color photos print crisp and beautiful, no complaints there. Also, it prints and scans quite quickly, and overall, I am very pleased with this printer. I've had this printer for a few weeks now. Wasn't sure how I felt about having a Wi-Fi printer, but we LOVE it now and wonder how we lived without it. This could be avoided if you purchase a printer cable to hook straight into your computer.All in all, a great printer for the money and a small home office. This is the fastest printer I have ever owned. I do love this printer. I cannot say that this printer is significantly better thanother Epson printers, but obviously the price is different, which I think isworth due to its features. The printer scanned and showed all the availablenetworks, but mine was hidden, and I was easily able to put the network nameand password manually. I wanted a printer that will not be out of date in the next three years, or the stop selling cartridges for. Overall great printer will be great for years to come. Really, how hard could it be to have a printer that is both WiFi and corded? I didn't even have to hook them to my printer with a USB cable. Truly an awesome printer otherwise, and I highly recommend it. Obviously, the printer needs to be adjusted and that translates on ink wasted, something of concern since the WorkForce 635 does not seem to allow third party ink to be used without giving you a lot of problems (according to problems documented in the web in regards to this model)There's plenty of functionalities in this unit to be tested, I personally configured the fax but have not used it to provide details about its performance as a fax machine, I will eventually update the review if I get to use it.Two final notes, it would have been nice if the USB cable was included as the manual strongly suggests to use one for the setup rather than doing it using the Wi-Fi capabilities of the device. The black printer I have is sleek, elegant and runs like a tiger. You won't be unhappy with this printer, especially at its current price point. This printer is a few steps up form my Workforce 600 which I love and has now moved into another room. This printer now has it on the front bottom, a tray slides out. I'm very pleased with the Epson Workforce 635; it truly is an all in one printer. Well it's kinda big, heavy, and it's not the cheapest printer out there (I've seen it in gold box on occasion for a great price).Overall, I definitely recommend the Epson WorkForce 635, but the largerEpson WorkForce 840 Color Ink Jet Wireless All-in-One with Fax (C11CA97201)may be a better buy if you have a home office. The Epson WorkForce 635 is a great printer at a great price. The printer I previously used (HP PhotoSmart 2575 All-in-One Printer / Copier / Scanner) was working perfectly well for me but lacked FAX functionality so given the chance to snag one of these All-in-Ones, I did just that.The Epson WorkForce 635 is a nice printer but compared to the 2575 from HP I was immediately struck by just how much bigger and bulkier this printer is. The 840 would hold about a full printer's ream (circa 500 pages) for what it's worth.Now another difference is the control panel.

JUDGMENT CALL:I absolutely love this printer!

This is a wonderful all-in-one printer but as you look into the price on Amazon, there is nearly a $60-$70 difference between both the 630 vs. the 635.Both are exact machines with the exception that the 635 does two-sided printing.
