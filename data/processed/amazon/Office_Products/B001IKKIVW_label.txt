You have made a label!I like that it's fast to print,  compact, easy to use, plug-n-play to any Windows based computer system running Windows 2000, XP or Vista, and can run on batteries or via the AC adaptor.What's not so great is the cost of the cassettes that hold tape refills of various sizes. The Brother PT-2430PC label printer is an extremely nice PC-connected unit. I turned off the label printer and restarted the computer7) When the computer finished rebooting and I turned the label printer back on the PC found it immediately and a pop-up window appeared that allows you to generate the text, etc., for a labelNote: a disc is included with the label printer, but you do not need to install anything before using the printer. Software for running the label printer is housed in the printer itself. It then prints the label and clips it off automatically.All in all, this is an awesome unit...well, as awesome as a label printer is likely to get...I mean, it's not a big-screen LCD TV or anything, but it does its job just fine.Oh, and if you need to make labels on the run...as from a lap-top where you do not have access to a power outlet, the label printer can run on 6 AA batteries.So, all in all, I find this label printer to do a great job. This is a very nice label printer. * PT-2430PC label printer. * USB Cable* User Manual* Starter label cartridge (1/2")* P-Touch Editor Lite software on CD and resident on label maker.The printer is about the size of a brick, but reasonably lightweight. Then I saw this label maker, with the ability to do creative fonts, layouts, and graphics, and I was sold.You must hook this labeler up to your computer to use it - it has no keyboard. This Brother label maker works very well. I've wanted a label maker forever, and when Amazon Vine offered this one for review, I was excited, but a little concerned that it had to be connected to a PC to work. It would print one label then the label maker  power light would flash, indicating an error. I could turn the label maker off and back on, print one more label, then get another error. It won't cut the previous label until it prints the next label and this way it doesn't cut off the blank 1/4" before each new label, thus not wasting near as much tape. This is by far the BEST label maker I've ever used. This label maker has taken out ALL of the frustration of handheld ones and made labelmaking easy and fun.All you do is hook it up to your computer and you're off. Just type out your label, hit the "print" button, and it prints and cuts it for you!I've had absolutely no computer compatibility issues using this on multiple PCs. I typed in a label name and VOILA! out came an outstanding white label with black lettering. This label printer is approximately the size of 2 VHS tapes, so it is big but not cumbersome. You still need to format from the label software as it automatically prints it all on 1 line. You can only export one label at a time to the software (there is no way to make it detect multiple rows as multiple labels, however columns are preserved on the same label). I have been using label maker to label my stuffs for years. I can construct my label design faster in PC now.3. Most of the Brother label makers do not come with the expensive $24.99 AC adapter.Con:1. Being able to easily preview my label design in PC before printing, I am sure this label printer will actually save my label tape expense for the long run.This label PRINTER will for sure replace my other two handheld lable makers. I have just finished playing with the Brother P-Touch PT-2430PC label maker. I'd estimate that I printed my first label within 2 minutes of turning the P-Touch on - without ever having to open the manual. This is a far more advanced from the typical keyboard-based label maker which has only a few fonts and limited or no graphics capabilities.The P-Touch PT-2430PC comes with the label maker itself, USB cable, AC power adapter, full P-Touch editor software if needed, and documentation. Once it is installed, you can install the label software successfully. The label printing is actually very good, and would have earned 5 stars from me if not for the install problems. The Brother PC-Connectable 1-inch Wide Label Maker is a phenomenally easy label maker to use. It is that easy!The label maker has a simple, but effective, editor that is available straight from the printer. Additionally, the label maker offers total portability - it can be powered by batteries or the adapter. Want to use the label maker on a computer that is not your own? )I've never owned a dedicated label maker before, but certainly have an appreciation for a good label. I ran a printed label under a faucet for 15 seconds. A label will only print via a computer. You have to reset the label maker to execute the program again. The Brother PT-2430 PC label printer comes with a USB cord to connect right to your PC. So, I think I'm back to my boring old label making needs. It is still a pretty fancy label maker though, easy to use and fun. This label makes is fantastic, it looks beautiful, like a real piece of office equipment and bet of all, makes me creative while it lets me personalize anything in my house ( labels for my spices, bathroom - organizing creams and samples, garden - keeping my seeds in order and beyond) and its fun, sometimes I look for this to put labels on, if the tape supply was free and limitless then I think my house would be plastered from roof to floor.Overall very easy to use, I didn't have all the batteries required on hand and was glad to see that it uses an AC adapter that I can plug in - it sits on my desk anyways so I just lave it under my monitor and it's always waiting for me to print. That's it.When you want a label, double click the little app that comes preloaded and you can enter text, borders and insert images. I got this to replace a small (and old) label maker that only made labes in one size.this one is great. As I said, the label was rather thick and the lettering imprint made it even thicker.Fast forward x number of years to today when I unpacked my modern day label maker. The label making screen appeared.From that point it was very easy to make a label. The label and the material itself both look very professional - black lettering on a white background with a glossy finish. This is very handy if you are going to use the label maker with different computers. This label maker is very easy to use. The label that comes out of it is already laminated. But when I connected the portable compact Brother label maker to my PC, I discovered the brilliance of this unassuming printer. wide) as your label needs require. I've not owned a label maker before, but have always wanted one. I am really impressed with this label maker. The label cartridges are not cheap either, so it's not fun to see it waste a bit each time you print. I am mostly pleased with the Brother PT-2430PC label printer. The label maker can print not only text, but also clip-art, as well as a vast array of of different bar codes.The Brother PT-2430PC label maker only gets 4-stars though for it's wastefulness with the label tape. If you only need to print one label, then the label maker feeds out a one inch strip of label tape and cuts it before making each label. However, since I am not traveling around, this label maker works just fine for me. Before long, I had my first label. I instantly printed out a label with a little panda icon on it and generated a random barcode to print. Before printing the label itself, it will cut a 1" tape with absolutely nothing on it. It's not the most portable label maker but it doesn't advertise it as a portable label maker either. If you want a label maker to use in the middle of the Sahara desert or the wilds of Borneo, then take one of the handheld kind you turn the dial on and click out letter by letter. I wanted my first label to be one that I could slap on the power unit so that I'd remember what device it was used for. I set up an inch-long label with two lines, and I had full control of the font style and size. I was really impressed that I could use Print Preview to see what I was going to get beforehand, instead of wasting the label tape "experimenting" with the output. The label came out, did the auto-cut, and easily separated from the backing paper. I haven't had a label maker before but have needed one every now and then to mark boxes/other objects so that nothing gets lost when I'm moving or trying to clear up the clutter in my room. I was all ready to print my first label! Figured why not print a label for the label maker as a test run. Wrote out that this label maker belonged to me, clicked the print icon, and out it came. I really like this label printer except for one fairly minor quibble (more on that later). This PC-compatible label printer uses the exact same label cartridges as those units - the Brother "TZ" cartridges, although this printer can use tape up to 1" wide, while my standalone P-Touch can use tape up to only 1/2" in width. The P-touch electronic label maker is an excellent product. This is a great label maker for home/office use, ideally would not need to look any further if you are looking for a decent PC compatiable label maker.Pros+ Easy to install, requires no software install/CD(software gets automatically installed)+ Preview labels on computer before printing+ Crisp & clear printing+ Ability to cut the label at the required length+ Good choice of fonts to print on the label+ Looks sturdy and built to lastSuggestionsBe judicious about the photos you want to print, small company logos are ok but if you are planning to print your kids photo on the tape, may notcome out that goodCons/Wish list+ Wish if could be used standalone without a computer(with a built in LCD preview/touch screen)I
