I like to keep a pen in the car to record gas fill-ups or make notes. When I try to write with a regular pen, nothing much happens, especially in the cold weather. I always like to carry a pen in my pocket. It's definitely a great pen, and if you've never tried one - please do!If I had to think of a negative it'd be the cost of refills. If you use a pen a lot this may not be idea for your daily (since you can buy a pack of pens for that price usually). While it writes the same as the Bullet pen, the pen feels much cheaper since it is made of plastic. While this pen is cheaper, I would still purchase the Bullet pen over this one. This pen is really dark and I liked that from it since the beginning.It has also a great design too. This pen was only a few more dollars than the refill cost me, so I decided to buy two of these so I always have Fisher Ink pens around me. This is the only pen you ever need really. The pen is thin, small and highly portable which makes it great for EDC carry. I would not make this my primary pen when other pens would work.Overall, I highly recommend this pen as part of an EDC kit or BOB.
