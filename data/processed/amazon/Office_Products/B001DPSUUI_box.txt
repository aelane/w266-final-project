Out of the box they look a little foggy but once through the sealer they come out crystal clear.Lamination is good and I could not peel the layers apart after sealing.The only issue I had was placing thick items inside the sheets lead to a small pocket around the item not being laminated.Once sealed items are still flexible and will wrinkle a bit when bent but it takes a pretty sharp angle to create a permanent crease. When the box arrived, I was surprised at how heavy it was. The box comes with 150 sheets which will last the casual laminator a very long time. My box of 150 pouches weigh 6.5 lbs (I checked with my kitchen scale). They look cloudy out of the box (you get 3 pouches x 50). It should just have a box that opens long, not just on the ends. The box is big and heavy, which gives you some clue as to the thickness of the pouches. I was surprised that a box of 150 laminating pouches would be so heavy, but when I opened the box and took out one of the pouches I understood.

The box is HEAVY, so keep it on a sturdy shelf!

(The box of them was actually a pretty hefty weight- again, surprised these are only considered 'medium duty').Laminate away!
