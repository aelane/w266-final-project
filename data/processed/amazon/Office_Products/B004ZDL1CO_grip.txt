There is a comfortable soft grip area that is grey and the rest of the pen is white with silver accents. I'm not sure what else to say about a pen except that it writes well and has a comfortable grip. I like the padded grip but it is just a little narrow for my grip as is the rest of the pen. She thinks auntie will find it easier to write with with the grip and the glide. The grip is comfortable and fits in my large/average size hand well, though a little thicker would be better for me. There's also a rubberized grip, so they don't slip if your hands get sweaty. Very easy to write with, decent grip (not quite an ergonomic grip). The grip is as good as other pens I have used but with the grey and white color scheme does look a bit more stylish. The grip is slightly soft rubber--not Sensa squishy but enough give to feel nice. I also have to have a larger grip size that fits comfortably in my hand.These Paper Mate InkJoy pens are amongst my favorite pens.

The soft, rubbery grip feels good and the slim, white pen is very attractive.The ink flow is okay, nothing special, and not as smooth and nice as the Pilot pen.

Rubber grip is not obtrusive.

I love that it has a grip and feels like a light pen but performs like a gel.
