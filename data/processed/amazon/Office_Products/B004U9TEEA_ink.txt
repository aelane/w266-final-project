Though they wrote beautifully, I got ink on my fingers. The ink didn't dry quickly and I got some on my finger when I touched a check. The ink occasionally will come out blotchy when I'm writing, and some of the colors are less vibrant than I had hoped (and this makes them hard to read). The ink flows well and the eight bright colors are great. The ink flows smoothly without blobs, and the pens write without having to prime them to get them started. I have always loved using colored ink. Not only did it write smoothly, but I noticed that the ink comes out in the perfect amount. After a few seconds the ink is dry and will not smear.The pens themselves are click pens and are comfortable with a soft grip. Sometimes colored ink helps for orginazation and distinction . This prevents the ink from drying out. but at least the ink looks pretty! The ink dries quickly enough that I couldn't smudge it in my normal writing, even when I was kind of tryingEach pen has a little plastic bubble  on the tip to keep it from drying out. The ink dries fast enough that the pens don't leave marks all over the side of my hand. (If you're left handed ink tends to accumulate on your hand as you move across the page) Colors are bright, the nib is smooth and gives an effortless writing experience. You do not have to press hard to have the ink (which dries immedately upon touching the paper surface)flowing effortlessly across the page. The ink is smooth, pigmented and fluid. Unlike most ink pens, you will not have to worry about the ink running or bleeding, which are great for left-handed writers.The ink tip is a medium tip, so it makes a larger imprint that I prefer. I am not sure if lighter ink is thicker because this isn't the only brand I've had issues with when it comes to neon/lighter-colored ink. This leads me to think the ink will bleed out over time and possibly stain anything the pens are stored in.I guess one should not expect much for under $.80 a piece, but I think when even cheaper pens have a smoother line, don't smudge and don't seem to leak, you might come with higher expectations for these that are not met.I'm not familiar with other colored ballpoint pens but I'm thinking there might be others that more consistently meet my needs for smooth lines, minimal or no smudging, and don't need to be cleaned off before use. *  Smooth ink flow. The ink doesn't come out evenly, creating little blots every time you change the direction of your stroke. The ink colors are easy to see and the pen writes very smoothly--when it writes. Sometimes the ink doesn't come out right away, which can make for a messy look. They write more vividly than regular colored ink pens, pretty much like a gel pen. I really like the black ink pens so I went ahead and ordered these color ink ones. The ink dries quickly without smudging. The ink flows our easily without leaving splotch marks. I have only tried the black ink so far. The ink doesn't bleed, leak, or stop--the pens provide a clean, consistent line. The ink did smudge a bit when used on glossy paper but once it dried it was fine.The colors are wonderful - several to choose from and each one writes as bright as the color of the exterior of the pen. They have a pretty smoothly ink flow (as versus delivering a scratchy experience) and they are so much nicer than the bulk pens I usually purchase. The ink is smoother, colors are vivid, but that ballpoint tip still can't hold it in, it BBBBBLLLLEEEEEDDDDDSSSSSS............... They collect ink on the tip, and deposit it randomly as you write. Black and blue ink get boring, so it is nice to jazz things up with some colored ink. The ink flows smoothly and writing with these pens is a nice experience. Other special ink pens may have similar issues so customers should be forewarned to take this into account. Its ink, just ink. Its not bad ink, just ink. The ink colors are exactly the same as the pen color, and the clicker works smoothly.
