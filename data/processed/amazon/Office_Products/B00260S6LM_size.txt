The size is great for portability. It is a nice size and the pages tear out cleanly without a mess. This is a really nice size sketch book to keep in my purse so I have it when inspiration strikes! The small size is perfect for slipping into a backpack or large purse. Perfect size for detailed notes or a quick sketch. The size of the sketchbook is perfect for tossing into a handbag or backpack, and it is sturdy enough to endure a lot of carrying around. This Sketch Diary is a nice size to stick into your backpack or purse. The size is a little small since my daughter tends to prefer a larger page for her work. The 9 x 6&#34; Academie Wirebound Sketch Diary is the perfect size to throw in your hiking pack or any other bag you may bring on an adventure where you may be tempted to do a little drawing! It's a good size but small enough to fit easily into a small backpack or handbag.

The size.

9 x 6 is a perfect size to carry with you; not too big so that it screams "I'm an Artiste," but big enough to get your drawing done with necessary detail.

First, and foremost, I LOVE the size of this journal.
