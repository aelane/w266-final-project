Alternatively, most of printer's services, at least the ones that really matter can be controlled from any PC-based app that can access the installed driver.The 2-tray claim is technically correct but in practice there is ONE paper tray plus a 'photo tray' on top of it that can hold up to 20 4x6" or 5x7" photo sheets. The printer's front has ports for USB and SD memory cards. The printer has the ability to direct the output to a PC on the network and even launch the default email application. The printer's ability to 'make' black ink out of colored ink when it ran out of black is as definite plus.As a home almost-all-in-one AND photo printer, this is a five-star. I love this printer, it is very silent and it prints at a very decent speed.installs in a breeze. I was dubious about a printer being able to do both text and photo printing, but the Epson Artisan completely put my doubts to rest. Yes, you do have to set up each printer once, but the set up is fairly pain free and once you do it, you're done. Furthermore, equally impressive (or perhaps even more impressive) is that the printer driver is such that basically what you see on screen (in regards to your photo) is what you're going to get in the print. This printer is on the "largish" size. But this printer has the same / similar concept as my 3800;  ie individual ink color carts, which really does help. It's amazing how far printer technology has come. A printer with this type of photo printing capability would have cost... In summary, this is a truely excellent all around printer for text and awesome photo printing. Connected this printer a few weeks ago, thinking that if glitches were going to occur, I wanted them to pop up before I wrote a review. Thankfully, the printer only requires one priming.The paper tray is well designed. I bought this printer for my mother (in her mid-70s) who isn't a big fan of technology. It's also a very quiet printer, in my opinion.
