I bought a Photo scanner printer combination several years ago which was much more expensive, but gave up as it was much too slow. It is essentially a flat top scanner like a photo copy machine, and my favorite feature, which I just discovered is it recognizes and scans multiple pictures simultaneously. I bought this scanner so my sister and I could both have a record of family photos and documents where we only had 1 copy. It's better than the All-in-One scanner, but it's also not as good as the professional scanners. Don't you hate firing up the scanner and waiting three minutes just to make a quick copy? That's why I purchased this LED scanner. This flatbed scanner works great. I also note this scanner use an LED lighting source, the warmup time is about three seconds. If this is your first scanner, I don't see anything that can go wrong. The scanner works well as described in other reviews. Coming from an (admittedly older) Canon LIDE scanner and the scanner in myCanon Pixma MX850 Office All-In-One Printer, LED scanning isn't whiz-bang new technology to me. And frankly, I wasn't expecting to put either scanner out to pasture.But Epson has proven me wrong with the V300.One of the biggest pains in scanning images for me, has been waiting for the scanner to warm up, and for the driver to accept that the scanner is warmed up and actually let me scan something. I got this scanner because my Win7 64-bit operating system wouldn't accept the 32-bit driver of my older HP scanner, instead offering a limited-function Windows driver. But for $60 (how much is the scanner?) I've been rather happy with this scanner thus far in its limited use. I am extremely happy with this scanner. I haven't had a scanner in years, so I am not horribly familiar with what current technology offers, but as far as simplicity and functionality - I took it out of the box, plugged it in, hooked it up to my computer, installed the software, and was scanning without any trouble. This scanner is excellent for the budget, home user.
