Another fine product from the folks at 3M innovations. I don't know what to say about this product other than that it works great. This product is proof that recycled should be the common practice! This product loaded and fed perfectly through my printer and used the template already found on word.Nice look and great stick, thanks 3M! Kudos to 3M for another great product. Otherwise, a good product that's comparable in most respects to Avery's 5150 labels. I was recently asked to review this product for the Amazon Vine program. Excellent product.

Not a fancy product, by any means, but they do what they're supposed to do.

It's not priced bad for an environmentally friendly and 3M product.

I liked this product for the most part, but I am a but puzzled why 3-M is trying to get this product reviewed on amazon vine.
