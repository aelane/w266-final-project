You can use them for mailing labels as I have done. The labels are made with a small section for grabbing the label without touching and adhesive, however the labels do curl up if not careful.So....what's the problem?? These labels are ideal for labeling and re-labeling the binders, as well as color coding them for easy categorizing. The labels are sticky enough to stay on yet I could still remove one from the wall three days later. Despite being firmly pressed down, all the labels were peeling off the jars within 20 minutes, without even being handled after I put them on the shelf. These labels are supposed to stick on until you take them off. That is much better than just leaving labels on and building up a stack of them whenever you have to relabel something. I won't have to worry about the labels leaving a mark or tearing the wrapping paper. There are 120 labels, 1"x3" each. Great simple labels. These labels remove cleanly so I can repurpose a folder for the next assignment. I think most of us have put labels on things, only to find later on that they need to be removed... resulting in damage to the labeled item, not to mention remnants of the label that are impossible to remove.These removable labels eliminate the need for improvised methods such as sticky notes (that fall off because there's limited adhesive) and scotch-taped pieces of paper, as they are easily removed with no damage to the item, or residual glue or paper. The labels are perfect for every day use. You can't rely on these labels to do that under normal conditions. Put these labels on 10 file folders. Worse than useless!So you can only use these labels on things that don't move or come into contact with moving things - like sticking them on a wall or a chart. These labels are brilliant! I got these labels because I am a physical therapist, responsible for keeping my own patient charts.I buy the pricey (pressboard) file folders for charts, so when a patient is discharged I like to re-use the file folder. Other 'removable' labels that I have tried have torn part of the pressboard away when removed - unprofessional looking.These labels, however, come off very easily without tearing. I don't normally 're-use' these labels - except in a few cases when I have stuck them on in the wrong place and need to switch them; they have had no problem re-sticking in those instances.I also like that they stay stuck without the corners coming up. Pencil worked, but was much easier to smudge on the labels than on standard 20lb bond paper. Reused labels stayed attached, but they could be brushed off relatively easily.It is important that removable labels can, in fact, be removed without doing damage. These labels are no exception. They are small, easy to use labels that perform exactly as the manufacturer promises.These labels are white with a colored line that encircles the edge of the labels, near but not touching the border. The labels are packaged efficiently by stacking them on top of one another. With some labels, the stick is so strong that part of the label and/or adhesive is left behind when the label is removed. These labels eliminate that problem because there isn't any more adhesive than necessary. The labels stay in place, but once removed, they take all the adhesive and label with them.If there is any drawback to using these labels, it would be the limitations on certain surfaces. These labels work just as promised. I have been waiting for sticky labels like this for a long time! They are also great for changing labels on boxes of items in storage such as what Christmas decorations are in which tub or box, etc. The labels come in a pack of 120, and you get three colors that are light enough to see the writing easily, and yet you can color-code your labeling. These labels work very well allowing one to write on them with any ink without smearing. First of all, I think these labels are so cute - a very simple but great design. These labels, however, do neither!! Also I used these labels to put a note on a book as a quick identification before sending it to summer camp with my daughter.These labels don't take place of my beloved Post-Its, but are a great addition to my collection of office supplies. 120 labels should last a while Unfortunately, these removable labels did not stick to that surface either. In summary, if you are planning on putting these labels on plain old paper, you should be OK, but do not try to put them on anything shiny, coated, or printed. These labels can be used for any purpose like Post-It / sticky notes. Definitely not intended as permanent labels. The labels peeled off easily, but they would not stick well to the plastic and kept falling off. Not impressed, I tried these labels on a variety of different surfaces such as wood, metal, and paper and the labels performed much better. These labels perform as temporary labels (that is how they are marketed as well), so if you need something stronger and more permanent, don't get these. These labels are great for using as tabs for my notebook. These labels come in several other color combinations in three-color packets. Using these removable labels, you can use the file folder, label it appropriately, and then easily peel off the label to re-label and re-use the folder. I use labels a lot. The Avery labels are a useful pad of sticky labels for multiple uses. These are labels that use an adhesive similar to the semi-sticky stuff on Post-Its. For just 120 labels, I would expect to be paying about a third of what they want for them. I can either use them as permanent labels or use the tab to remove them. These labels can be used in a variety of ways other than on files which is an additional benefit. The labels are very "green" in that they are made from recycled consumer paper; however, they will also cost you some "green" in the way of $3.79 to buy them, which to me is a little steep when you consider that you only get 120 tiny label pads. What can you really say about labels? Let me think...  From what I can tell, these labels work well on all surfaces and come off more easily than other 'non removable' types. The labels also work well in an office setting. Overall, these labels work as advertised and have shown me that they can come in handy not just in the office, but also in the home. These labels are nice. Yes and no.These labels are fairly large and not unattractive. These labels do not appear to have that problem.Another thing I like is that they are all-over sticky (except the pull-tab on the end). These are good labels for office or everyday use. These labels come in a tear off pad like post-it notes. These labels come in a label pad with three colors. I was able to cut these labels in half horizontally and use them as labels for my cassettes. But I do like to organize--and reorganize--and these labels are perfect for that. These little labels are great! Other labels like this that I've tried were only sticky near one end and so they didn't last long. They are also great as temporary labels (moving/packing instructions, garage sale labels, etc.) The early labels were permanently applied and taking them off just did not work. I do like my labels. I've been using these labels for temporary jobs (as they are meant to be removable) and am quite pleased with them. The labels stick well, yet remove easily and do not leave a residue. Unfortunately, these labels have less adhesive than Post-it Notes! It is also easy to write on the labels in the pad format, and the paper is a nice quality & takes ink well.I would give these labels 5 stars if the adhesive was stronger, as I can't really think of why I would want to put a label on anything where it would be temporary. I would hate to risk using these labels on a file folder or box, and then come back months later to find the label had fallen off. These are some cute labels. The colored labels are very useful and remove easily from items even though they adhere well. Most of the labels I use are sheet labels that I print from the computer but once in awhile I need just a single label and I hate to break up my sheets for just a few labels here and there. I've stuck these labels on wood moldings and edges of my desk along with the usual papers and folders, and they've stayed in place just fine, unlike Post-Its usually do for me.The paper is smooth and mostly opaque. These labels can be used to color code folders or other items. So you can handle the labels using this tab without it getting stuck to your finger (potentially ruining the label). This is great to store these labels in between uses. I pretty much LOVE these removable labels! What I liked about these labels is that they stayed in place until you removed one - they didn't flop all over. These labels seem like a good idea, something you can stick on and then move, if you want. As one who tries wholeheartedly to stay organized, I really appreciate these little removable "labels." These labels lie perfectly flat, are removable and re-positionable, and if you want to make it a little more permanent, just remove the small tab which is micro-perforated and tears off easily. The removable labels are an outstanding product. We like these temporary labels. the labels stay in place until they need to be removed, and then they can be removed promptly. These Avery labels work as you'd expect them to, and are great for labeling more than just items you might want to mail. It is hard to find removable labels and I really like that feature. These labels are excellent and applicable to many uses. These colorful labels are essentially post-it notes adapted for a more permanent use. These labels are the solution.I also use them in cookbooks to note changes I've made to recipes. The labels are fully adhesive and they are really useful.2. I particularly like these framed labels. I use these labels on food storage containers and freezer bags to help me know when to throw out food and what to keep based on the dates. These are removable labels, and in my experience usually that means if you try hard enough you can get some of the label off before destroying your document or whatever you put it on.These do come off a lot easier, but as many have said, they don't stick all that well.T
