It's a lot of machine in a compact design. Even though I have a lot of computer equipment and some knowledge of what I'm doing, I have had some very unsuccessful experiences with attempts to connect wireless devices... It uses a lot of ink and there's nothing I can do about it. We do a lot of home office and schooling, and the whole family operates it without difficulty(Ages 6-).Number 3, cost of operation? Runs smooth and silent with a lot of features that make this one well worth the money. I used a lot of HP products before but this by far exceeds HP products in the same price range by a mile.It is easy to use and can be used directly from the USB per the wireless feature.Recommended. If you do a lot of document scanning, then an all-in-one printer like this that has a tray that will automatically scan the next page for you is what you want. Epson gives you a lot for your money with this All-In-One Printer and with it's great customer support and 1 year warranty, it's definitely a 4 1/2 Star All-In-One. It has a lot of multi functions that can be used and is easy to follow.
