Also the tape is good quality and you can't see it on the paper. It's replaced our traditional tape dispenser. The tape is of extra high quality too. This tape dispenser is an excellent thing to have anywhere in the house where you might need a small piece of tape. It does stay put when you pull on the tape. This tape dispenser is really useful because it eliminates the need to use two hands when you are grabbing a piece of tape. Uniform tape pieces! The tape comes out perfectly and the pre cut lengths seem practical for most purposes. It's hard to place the tape in the dispenser as well as to pull what you need. The tape is high quality and comes in the perfect size strip to wrap packages, hang artwork, and secure envelopes. I'm not sure this will replace the cheaper tape I buy for everyday projects. I have been wanting the pop-up tape strips for quite awhile. I use heavy tape dispensers that hold the roll of tape in place for me to pull off a piece, because the little hand-held dispensers really make it hard with my arthritis.So I finally got a chance to try this, and it works well. Easy to carry and store simply whip out and tape it up back together whether you or someone else broke it. Just "stick" with the regular tape dispensers for now, this one needs a design overhaul. This is one handy little tape dispenser. The tape is cut in strips, so they only pull a little, and another piece pops up. This pop-up tape dispenser fits my lifestyle in every respect. It was very easy to load the tape (instructions are clear... even for the... ahem... instructionally-challenged), and started working with the first pull. The tape dispenses easily, and I can already see myself getting spoiled by the convenience (note to self: order refills now). Finally they invent the Pop-Up tape dispenser and go home but they have wasted their time.Its only advantage is that the strips of tape are pre-cut, the idea is that you pull out the next one from the cartridge and whack it on. When I pulled the first tape out, nothing came out of the slot to replace it. I already knew I liked the pop-up tape dispensers because I tried them in the past, but what really turned me off to them before was that they were not refillable.
