Each color down the pad is about 1cm longer than the one on top. Each color is a different size, allowing you to select the smaller top pages for short notes or the larger bottom ones for lists or longer reminders. You can skip to whatever color you like and rip off a sheet without harming the integrity of the package. This makes it easy to take whatever color you need.The quality of the sticky notes are on par with the 3M/Scotch Post-It notes that I normally use. I like how they are stacked and staggered so I can choose a different color if I want to. You get 30 of each color in this pack. Any color / size can be used at any time since they are perforated near the top by the binding. Each color is separated so you can get to the color below that.They are not as sticky as the 3M Super Sticky notes but are pretty comparable to the regular 3M post-its. Personally the color of sticky note has never been much of an issue with me, but I know some people might color code the notes based on categories or something similar. Each color is a different size, so you don't have to waste a lot of space if you don't need to say much. What makes them so handy is that you can flip them up and fold them over to get to the color and size that you want. My favorite color, the hot pink, is on the bottom of the pad and is almost twice the size as the orange that is on the top of the pad. You can remove whichever color and size you want without having to break apart the whole pad.One of my favorite uses for these notes is to mark where I am in a knitting or crocheting pattern and I can move them many times before the stickiness is worn off.I wonder why no other company has thought about this stair-step design before; it's a great idea and cute too. You can easily grab the color or size that you need and pull it out without ripping the paper or disturbing the entire pad.I usually have two or three post-it pads on my desk because I like the small ones and the big ones. Worth mentioning that each color of notes are different sizes, though that hardly seems like a drawback.

Some might like them to be uniform in color, but this iteration works well for my purposes.At first it takes a little work to get to each size as the connecting paper is a little stiff, but once you work it in a bit it works fine.Great idea from Avery.

Each color grouping is its own individual size, however.

I'm a color person - I don't always remember what's on a note, but I know to look for a particular color.
