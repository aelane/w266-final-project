The clipboard barely holds one piece of paper.Is it a Management System?Sort of. The clipboard is essentially useless, being rather flimsy and the half-circle black clip being clunky and not holding much. Also comes with a clipboard to separate and identify between files. The clipboard is a handy place for quick access to work in progress. The clipboard that comes with it is a nice addition. As for the so called "clipboard," I'm sure that if you have kids, you could find a higher quality clipboard somewhere in their toy box. I have yet to use the clipboard insert for anything.As a whole, I like this system. The clipboard that comes with it is a joke. It is flimsy and not rigid enough to be a decent clipboard. The clipboard itself is made of flexible plastic, which makes it hard to use detached from the folder since it doesn't offer adequate support. The clipboard was a bit unwieldy to use when trying to take notes.
