I requested this binder for my son who is about to start first grade and 1 in. This binder feels durable and I feel that it will hold up well throughout the school year. This is a very thick binder with a clasp that closes easily and very well. This is a narrow binder, so it doesn&#8217;t really need the fold-out spine/front (which it has) or D-rings (which it does not have). This binder was a disappointment from the moment I opened the box. &#8203;I am not a binder connoisseur by any stretch of the imagination - and my only strong emotion comes along when one falls apart earlier than I think it should.That said, I have carried this back and forth from school, in a backpack along with another binder, notebooks, and a laptop, and it has proved to be sturdy enough to survive without any visible ill-effects.This binder hosts some very nice features - plastic sleeves that are handy at holding on to extra stuff (such as index cards), outside pockets to label its contents, strong hinges, and the new one finger release (a huge ergonomic improvement).I have become very fond of that last feature ever since I encountered it on a previous binder. This is a serviceable binder with round rings that open and close with ease. Overall, this is a binder that is satisfactory in all respects. Better than your ordinary binder. I think this binder will stay in great condition for a while. This binder is just that-a binder. It is no better or worse than any non-metal hinged binder. This nice Wilson Jones binder is listed as being an &#34;ultra duty&#34; binder. A nice well-made binder. This binder works great for that purpose! This binder at first feel seems a little lightweight.As an office-product lover, I do appreciate the clear front covering that allows a customized covering to be inserted.Also, the inside pockets on the front and back have awesome double tiered pockets. This is a very nice, sturdy binder for the money. This is a cardboard binder covered on plastic with pockets on the inside cover and three rings. It is a basic binder. There really isn&#8217;t much to say about this binder. This binder is akin to what you would find in most offices. This binder is lightweight. So far the binder is holding up and seems durable enough for my needs. Having just reviewed another binder from the same designer/manufacturer, my reaction to both binders was still the same. This three ring binder is one inch thick and it holds up to 220 sheets of paper. It's great if you need a simple binder in an office environment.I can't say there's anything special about it, but there's definitely not at anything wrong with it. Mostly, this is a binder. This binder feels and looks cheap - the customizable panels gap, the white vinyl has interior bubbles. The binder clip opens very smoothly with one hand operation. This is a durable binder with great features. I have another binder from the same product line but of different size and it also has lots of air bubbles. Functionally, this binder works very well and have durable plastics. The "Ultra Duty" didn't seem much different then the "Heavy Duty" binder from Wilson.I have been scrapbooking for 40 years and the last 12 years have found using the Wilson 1 to 2 inch binders the best for my needs. This is a durable binder that checks off all the good things. This binder works great for my forth grader. This binder however seems to be holding up extremely well! The binder has 1 inch round rings that hold up to 220 sheet of paper. When carrying or pulling out the binder, the front cover tends to flop around and be uneven with the back, causing the sheet protectors or papers inside to be frayed at the edges. I also felt like the binder itself was a cheap product. This is the perfect binder for high use applications. The binder rings are secured to the back of the binder so the front of the binder wraps around the rings for higher capacity. I&#8217;ve been using the Wilson Jones binder (W87900PP2) to file important bank statements. The binder, however, can be closed by pressing the rings shut. I customized the Wilson Jones binder I am using to store my bank statements. The Wilson Jones Ultra Duty binder seems to be made as a standard quality binder but at a somewhat hefty price. Together I would keep looking for another binder of heavier duty in this price range. This is a very nice binder. This is a pretty good binder. I did not think that I would love this binder as I removed it from its shipping box, but I was wrong. This is a binder of high quality which is lighter in weight than I'd expected. I can definitely recommend this binder. The Wilson Jones Ultra Duty Round Ring Binder is a solid binder to use for work and school. The binder is durable, the rings open and close smoothly, and the papers stay inside the binder effectively. I am using the binder for music I've downloaded and printed myself, so I need it to stay open on my piano - and it does! This is also the first binder I've seen that has two pockets on the inside of both covers (a total of four pockets), making it easy to keep loose papers neat and handy. I'm not sure how that happened, but the binder hasn't had heavy use as yet, so it isn't as indestructible as they claim. Overall, I'm very happy with this binder and recommend it. The best binder I have ever owned! is yes if you plan on using the binder over a period of time, with multiple users or switch out the contents often.First, it opens like a dream. This binder performs okay but I notice that it is all too easy to pull the rings apart just enough where a heavier page can slip out from at least one of the three rings. The binder has traditional circle rings inside (as opposed to &#34;D-shaped&#34; rings). This in itself should help the binder last longer.The vinyl is heavy duty, but I'm not convinced it's different than the 100 other binders we've bought through the years. This is a standard round-ring binder of good quality. It's a good basic binder that is reasonably priced. This is a very functional (although relatively thin) binder. These is a pretty good binder. I love that this binder has two sets of full-page size clear pockets on both sides (four total inside pockets); this is a helpful addition that I have never seen before.This has just one tab to open the binder - on the bottom, with nothing on the top. This Wilson binder is surprisingly light, which worried me. The binder still works but I expect a little more durability from the Terminator Binder.The front and back cover and the spine have clear pockets that you can use to label the binder. We use this binder around the house as a recipe / food binder. This is a black binder with the old style circular rings for paper. This binder has enough space and is not too big so I can take to meetings with me. This is a standard looking binder with a great ring system that opens by clicking the bottom side of it. This is a very generic binder; it seems to be sturdy enough to hold together and allow me to use it for a single purpose. I wanted a small 1&#34; binder for our retirement papers. If you were looking for a 1&#34; binder and this was a good price I'd say it is adequate. This is not an ordinary binder. This binder is perfect to store documents like investment or bank statements. This binder feels a little more durable than most, but it's not made of titanium or anything, so if you squash it in a backpack or otherwise abuse it, it will bend or fall apart.That being said, the binder is sturdy, easy open-close. ...the binder that I was using alongside this particular binder., I could really tell the difference.The Wilson Jones Ultra Duty Round Ring View Binder was secure but not so tight that it was a fight to open (unlike the other binder that I was working with). So I'm giving this binder a 5-star. The binder itself feels like it's pretty sturdy. This binder is easy to open. But this binder has some of the same quality problems, most offensively the bubbles beneath the material on the inside covers. That means this binder gets a workout every day, and so far it's holding up like a champ.Pros:1.) That's not the binder's fault, though.)3.) It looks like any other binder from the outside. It is barely adequate as a binder, and is about as heavy duty as the cheapest, economy binders I've ever bought. The binder itself is so weak and flimsy that I doubt it will even last a month.This isn't a terrible binder, but there is no way it is heavy duty, "extra durable", or worth the high price. All in all I will be surprised if it would last any longer than a $5.00 binder. This binder will do what it says, and it was perfect for my small ring binder needs. I wouldn't bet on that but this binder does seem to be a bit better quality than many others out there on the market. Time will tell but I'd be surprised if these lasted much longer than any other binder out there. My binder came with some bubbles under the surface that aren't the end of the world (they're on the inside) but for an "Ultra Duty" binder with these claims you'd think they'd be in perfect condition.Overall I think this binder has some great features and I would recommend it. This durable, black binder includes a clear pocket on the front, back, and side, and a pocket on the inside. This binder holds up to 220 sheets of paper. This isn't your run-of-the-mill binder. For them, I have found that a flexible binder in general will make it farther though the school year. Overall, this is a durable binder with easy to open rings that would be ideal for people with arthritis or young students with small hands. The binder feels strong and durable, not flimsy at all.
