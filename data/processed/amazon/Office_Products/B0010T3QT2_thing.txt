One thing I do care about, however, is that the paper is so thin the envelopes crumple at the corners when I run them through my laser printer. One thing to consider is that no matter how safe an envelope is when sending sensitive material, you have to also consider the shipping method. It doesn't seem like a big thing--but peeling the strip off the self-seal envelopes can be a pain and those strips end up everywhere. The one thing about these envelopes that I really don't care for is the way you seal them. The nice thing about that is that there is nothing to throw away. The only thing that kept me from giving them five stars is that they seem a little thin. Another thing is that you do not have to lick these. The only thing you might be able to see is if you only put a check in the envelope without a sheet of paper around it. One thing I did note was at no point did I see the warning text claimed on the product box.

The first thing I liked about these envelopes is that they don't weight anything.

Only thing preventing me from giving them 5 stars is that they're a bit pricey.Very pleased.

The best thing about them is that you don't have to lick to seal.
