Unlike some recycled paper products, these sticky notes don't have any off texture or graininess. I do like that they are made from recycled paper - waste not, want not. It is cool that these are made from recycled paper, but other than that these don't really stand out. The standard paper is quite smooth to the touch while the recycled paper is just a tad rougher. I will say that the paper is a bit thinner thanPost-it Notes, Original Cube, 1 7/8 inches x 1 7/8 inches, Assorted Neon and Ultra Colors, One Pad per Packand tends to curl when it is not adhered to something, unlike standard notes. I've even moved the paper a few times and it has stayed put. Also, they are made of recycled paper so that's good for the environment. The paper is made from recycled material, and it feels that way. The paper is advertised as recycled, and they really feel like it. Rather, they feel thin, like a cheap paper. The paper feels a little more textured; although you can't see it. If you need to use paper to get information to someone, there are sticky notes of every size, shade and paper quality to meet your needs.These stickies are of the standard size and so can't contain much information, but the paper is of surprisingly high quality for being recyclable. Otherwise, though, the paper is of good quality and the notes have the perfect amount of stickiness. I was afraid that this recycled paper would not work as well as Post It Notes that I normally use. The paper is the right density and the stickiness is just right to stick to another paper, your desk, your monitor and even your shirt for a short time although I don't recommend it. Besides, they're made of recycled paper! The paper doesn't have a cheap paper feel. That IS nice...so often, green paper products are only a small percentage recycled. What I like about these is that they are made from recycled paper. Avery Sticky Notes, made of recycled paper, have reached this lover of office stationery, and she is pleased. It's recycled paper, and pastel (meaning matte colors), thus I don't expect them to be bright and strong like regular sticky notes. The paper is thin - even for recycled standards, and the adhesive - while adequate - is not very strong.The baseline is: you can buy better products, even at lower prices. Otherwise, these are made with recycled paper, which you can somewhat tell by touch and visual examination, but I do not find that a problem at all. Post-It regular paper in assorted colors comes with just 65 notes per pack, vs. Avery packs providing 150 notes.Quality recycled paper sticky notes, that stick on multiple surfaces for an extended time, plus Box Tops for Education all add up to a great product.

The Avery Sticky Notes made of recycled paper certainly do the trick.

She just commented that the recycled paper gave a slightly rough feel through both the pen and the hand--a little less smooth and comfortable than she hopes to have.

The paper is slightly rougher than non-recycled, but smooth enough for a regular ball-point pen to write well.
