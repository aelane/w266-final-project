This printer is being used at home for photo printing, DVD label printing, and many, many double sided pdfs. Very, very easy to follow - extremely intuitive.--Super Quiet!-- I find this printer very quiet comparatively, which is nice considering it is currently in our upstairs hallway (and late night printing sessions have not seemed to disturb my sleeping family).--Scanner to direct CD/DVD labeling-- I love that you can put a DVD or CD directly face down anywhere on the scanner bed and it will scan it directly to a new CD/DVD for you.--Autofeed cover -- I am not sure how to adequately describe this - the autofeed tray is typically hidden (unless being used) by a fold-down cover. This printer is a STAND-OUT in the attractive category, definitely putting my HP to shame. So, if the printer will be in a highly visible location, it is a winner. I just set up this printer the other day. This printer is a breeze to load via the tray. It's a nice printer for this price range! The printer has never disappointed me, although I was a little surprised by the somewhat flimsy, plastic construction. The printer itself is contained is a heavy-duty, clear plastic bag, which includes handles for pulling the printer out of the box. After sitting the printer atop the counter in my office, I went about removing the protective plastic wrap and multiple tape strips that are inside and outside of the printer. After powering up the printer for the first time, the touch screen prompted me to select a location and language, and also asked me to setup things like time and date. Obviously this printer performs best with only Epson photo papers. Everything about this printer seems tidy, space saving, sleek and shinny. It never occurred to me that a more-expensive and three-year-newer printer would not do the same. I find this printer excels in a number of areas and fails in only one.Here's my take on it:PROS:1. This printer actually can use recycled paper. The printer includes an automatic duplexer. The printer itself is good-looking and fits in well with the other equipment on my desk. This is a good printer for a family network.Four stars!UPDATE: November 25, 2009I reinstalled the software, using the software downloaded from Epson. However, this is the fourth duplex printer I've owned, and it is by far the best. I bought this printer to replace an HP because it was also able to print on CD/DVDs. I am not going to return this printer but will probably gripe quite often when I run into problems like those listed above. Now, that said, I have only owned this printer for 24hrs. Actually, it's funny, I think it took longer to unbox the printer and take all the wrapping and tape off of it than it took to install it. Perhaps not, but it does make it easier for me to use the printer as I don't have to squint to see the screen.When I added paper to the paper tray, I was pleasantly surprised that it holds legal size paper! This printer was easy to set up, though you need to know how to get your WiFi credentials out of your router in order to let it join a wireless network (there's usually a user-friendly program to set and display the password from a laptop or desktop on the network).It does drink ink a bit heavily, which I think may be linked to the ink not drying up during periods of inactivity like all my other Epson printers have done. The printer came with the individual ink carts needed as well as a spare high capacity black which was nice.Printing speed is the same as the 700 - ie very fast, although if it hasn't printed for a day or so it does spend a lot of time initially waking up and clunking away as it charges the ink for the new print run. This is quite possibly the best printer that I've ever owned. The printer stops printing when any one of the cartridges runs dry and that inevitably happens Thursday at 11:30pm when the kid's trying to print out her homework.Connectivity - Both wireless and wired networking is supported, although you can only use one at a time. If you're going to be using the printer wirelessly, plan on initially use a wired connection to get it configured...you can do it through the front panel, but it's a lot of button pushes. Once the printer is up and running, you can disconnect and move it to wherever it's going to live.Memory Card + USB port - Nothing too special here. Like any other printer with a display, you stick in the memory card, select the picture you want to print and go. This is my ninth all-in-one printer, the fourth one that I've reviewed for Amazon, and the first one that warrants five stars.I
