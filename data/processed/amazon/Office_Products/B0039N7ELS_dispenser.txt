The Scotch Adhesive Dot Roller is a handy little adhesive dispenser that allows you to easily and quickly apply adhesive without the mess that comes with glue bottles. The dispenser says it's made from 65% recycled material, will the plastic off-gas toxins. What this little dispenser does is place a narrow strip of adhesive dots onto any surface that it's applied to. The dispenser is built out of high quality plastic and it will last a long time even with heavy daily use. So how sweet is this tidy little dispenser rolling neat little glue dots without fuss or mess. This is a handy little dispenser of adhesive that works much better. I also want one that DOES NOT tangle or skip inside the dispenser causing waste. I do like the dispenser itself and the fact that it is made with 65% recycled material. The dispenser makes this an easy chore. Looking at the dispenser, you would never guess how easy it is to maneuver the tape just where you want it. Then you just roll the dispenser along your paper. The dispenser reads, "PERMANENT." This is an easy to use (just be sure & hold the dispenser with the open little white trap door facing down, not up! ).Finally, the dispenser is refillable - just pop open the dispenser, remove the spent cartridge & insert the new one.
