This is the only laminator I have ever used. Very nice little laminator, especially for the price. I have this laminator in my home office and it has been working well for over a year now. When you turn the laminator on, there are status lights that let you know when the machine is ready for use. We have been using this laminator for over a year with no problems. It's a great laminator for what it is - an inexpensive "home use" laminator.It does take some time for it to warm up. A laminator this size ordinarily would cost a whole lot more.I've only used it twice with the two 9" X 11.5" pouches that came with it. The laminator perfectly sealed two 9"" X 11.5" photographs.I've ordered a pack of 50 more pouches from Amazon (for under $10.00). Anyway, I need a laminator and this model has turned out to be better than I originally thought. I watched this laminator for a long time, but didn't buy it, then actually needed something laminated in a pinch and went to an office supply store to have it done. If you're looking for an inexpensive laminator, look no further. I saw this laminator for sale, and I couldn't resist it.It does just what it is supposed to do, and it does it very well. The laminator works great for various crafts, making tissue paper stained glass, bookmarks, Personalized Luggage tags that stand out, cookbooks and more. This is a perfect little laminator for my homeschool lapbooks and schedules for my children. This Scotch Thermal laminator  does the trick beautifully. This Scotch laminator produces a consistant seal every time. I finally have a full sized laminator!!! The laminator is really easy to use and produces a great result. My old thermal laminator, I had to feed it a couple of times to make sure it sealed, but didn't have to with this unit. I purchased this to replace an outdated laminator. I have a very expensive laminator and honestly this inexpensive one works great. I really didn't need a laminator but purchased this just because it was cheap as the Amazon Gold Box Deal of the Day. We bought this laminator for a project I was working on for our toddler. I opted to purchase the laminator for just over the cost of this 1 project. Now I can't imagine not owning a laminator. I have purchased this laminator at least 10 times for others. This laminator is definitely one of the best items I've ever purchased from Amazon. Using the laminator was not difficult to learn, which makes it great for most users.Common sense warning: the laminating sheets are 'pouches' but this does not mean you can put anything through the laminator, just flat items. if you hope to use this laminator for 5 mil pouches, save your time, money and frustration and pay a little more for a better unit. This laminator is very easy to use and does an excellent job. I got this laminator for my own home use, but I found I was using it for all kinds of things at the church where I work as well. And while I've wanted a laminator for years, actually owning one eluded me. )The laminator is small so it will be easy to put in a drawer when not in use. This is a great, easy to use laminator. I am very pleased with this laminator. If you just need a basic laminator, or are just starting out with one, this is the one to get. I think this laminator is ideal for most home use, teachers, light-duty business use, and the occasional special project. I am very satisfied with this laminator. Once you've accomplished that, however, it's as simple as inserting it into the laminator and letting it do its thing. I bought this laminator to use at home, for worksheets and Montessori cards for my kids and have found it very easy to use. Have been using this laminator for about one week. I used this laminator as soon as it arrived and found it easy to use and the laminated document looked very good. I have always thought it would be nice to have a laminator at home for small projects and keepsakes. It is small, desktop, lightweight laminator. I bought this laminator specifically for laminating the temporary license plate on my step-deck semi-trailer. I have been looking for a laminator for a few weeks and decided to buy the Scotch (TL901).
