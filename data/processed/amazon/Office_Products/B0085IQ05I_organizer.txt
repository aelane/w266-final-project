Never seen this in ANY other organizer. I love this organizer and it is ideal for keeping documents in place. I needed an organizer for cards for assorted holidays and this is going to work out just perfectly for me. This organizer strikes the perfect balance. Affordable, easy to use, and durable, this organizer cannot be beat. My expensive organizer from Levenger ended up getting ruined and I saw this and thought I'd try it. This organizer is light weight and won't add to the weight limit by any stretch of the imagination! I like this organizer for a number of reasons. The organizer doesn't stay as "tight" as I'd like when I am carrying fewer papers. This organizer can accommodate about a 1 1/2" thickness of material (documents, bills, invoices, receipts, etc.) The organizer also comes with pre-printed inserts to sort by letter. This is a great little organizer, it seems durable I expect that it will hold up for some time. I would recommend this handy, versatile, sturdy organizer. The Step Index Organizer is a durable, quality organizer with tiered tabs. This organizer will do very nicely. I've been using this organizer on a daily basis for about (2) weeks taking it to and from work, and loading it with project work (various 8x 11 sheets of paper). I really like this little organizer, which takes up about the same amount of space when empty as something likeFive Star Student Expanding File, Red (72387)(which I have a million of), but fits a lot more stuff and makes it so that I don't have to use two different folders for a year's worth of household records.What I particularly like is the design that allows you to see all of the tabs on the top - I would think that would be a great feature if you have a few of these and want to easily see which one you are selecting.I am also a big fan of how the tabs aren't distributed diagonally like most folders, but instead are staggered. This expandable organizer is well-built with great separators and tabs. I currently use this organizer to keep track of utility and medical bills for the year.

And the organizer opens wide enough to be able to contain a few hundred pages.Although this is touted as "waterproof" I would not carry it under my arm in the rain -- protect it, because the contents will get wet - the cover flap can only cover just so much of whats's inside.

This is the strongest and most durable organizer I have ever had.

This organizer has a see-through window so you know exactly what is in there without having to open it up.
