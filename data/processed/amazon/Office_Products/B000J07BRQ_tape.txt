I like this tape for several reasons:The size of the roles are convenient to store in the drawer, easy to handle.The tape does not go crazy on you once you pull a strip. The tape holds very straight and does not curl up and stick to itself.I like the durability of the tape, it is strong, it is thick. This tape does not split into many strips. I use tape constantly sending out etsy orders, and I've gotten more picky about it. It's a hefty tape so its easy and fast to use. The cheap tape doesn't stick to creases and folds very well, it tends to be stiff and often a corner or two will refuse to stay stuck down. This Scotch tape is actually pretty thin and flexible, it is easy to tear off and dispense with its little built on container, and it sticks wherever I tell it to -- no more little tapey corners sticking up everywhere. I buy Scotch tape products all the time. I use the tape to go over shipping labels and to add extra strength to whatever I am shipping out. I like this tape as it is very strong. The tape is wide enough to seal the boxes (or packages) well.However, if you want the best packing tape, esp. Purchasing the cheap $1 tape is not always the best way to go. When I got the Scotch Shipping tape I immediately saw I had a quality product. This tape is heavy and not one time did it curl up and stick to itself. This tape is excellent for its intended purpose. I've been using this tape for many years and have tried switching to some less expensive brands, but have always come back.Other tapes that I have tried are thinner and more prone to folding and sticking to itself or ripping. This tape will not rip and is stiff enough to resist folding into itself and creating waste. It's great, It's tape. It's sticky, as tape aught to be, and works as it should. Scotch tape, what more can you say about it? The tape is crystal clear and feels like it gives a solid adhesion that you can trust for mailing packages in any temperature climate. would recommend this tape to friends and family. Well, I though this until I discovered the Scotch Heavy Duty Packaging Tape.This is what I discovered:1) The tape dispenses easily and when I use it, noticed it stuck well to the package not to my fingers or hand like the cheap tapes.2) The tape is thick enough to cover the area on the box I want it to cover and I don't have to keep on adding more tape to make it work.3) Tighter on edges - When I ship a box that has thick edges or maybe uneven edges, I rely on this superb tape to adjust out to the edges and cover them well. This tape does it in ONE SWOOP!Very pleased with this tape. A Ferarri will not fit in a Christmas stocking so they will get tape, with a cheap but effective dispenser. I typically by tape by Scotch because I have never been disappointed by their products. I have bought cheaper tape before where you had to insert it into a dispenser and it never worked out well. It was not difficult to roll the tape out and the cutting action was quick and effective. The little tabs keep the tape from sticking back to the roll, although just to be safe I rolled over the edge for storage. You won't be disappointed by this tape. The tape is strong, comes off the roll easily, sticks incredibly well, and is clear as can be. This tape is obviously made for commercial and industrial packaging, yet the dispenser is so small and cheaply made as to be useless.Take a pass on this one. I purchased these to use with my tape dispenser but they are too small to fit. I have been using Scotch tape for many years and have always been satisfied. Good tape, good price. Not only does the tape adhere to itself, but the cutter doesn't cut, and the "dispenser" does a lousy job of dispensing. Once I pull out the tape, it does seem to stick to the boxes I'm sealing, but it's truly a pain. It is certainly nice to not have the tape rip since it's so thin though.Star off for the tape dispenser - it's a bit awkward, and you'll lose some tape the first time as it rips off the label on the lip of it, which is fairly poor design. I had to move and remembered I had this tape well let me tell you that it is very strong and worked great I had taped boxes that where in an open pick up and very heavy and not one box opened or had the bottom fall out. The tape is plenty sticky, and the carrier is designed in such a way that it doesn't constantly fold back over onto itself and ruin a piece of tape.I use this for shipping packages with relatively heavy items. The tape is thick and strong enough that you only need to apply one layer. Just apply some tape to the surface and lift the tape. This tape is reliable, thick, strong, crystal clear, and really sticks.You only need one wrap around a box to safely seal it shut.You can go over labels and not see the tape at all.The blade on the dispenser cuts really well.When you get used to using the dispenser you can really wrap up a lot of boxes in record time, very smoothly. This tape doesn't tear easily at all. )This tape has a strong seal, and the wide 2 inch width ensures that both sides of a box's seam are secure. I use this tape for mailing books and for sealing boxes for the attic. This tape can do it all. The tape is also transparent, crystal-clear. This will allow you to use the same tape to attach labels and/or protect labels from the weather. The tape is clear tape that is good for packaging. Very very strong and thick tape, more than enough to seal any package. You can't go wrong with Scotch tape and this product is no different. And it doesn't tare when you don't want it too like cheap generic tape. I have been using Scotch's Premium tape for some projects other than shipping packages. The tape is not going to break or tear. This is probably the best clear tape you can buy in terms of strength and durability. I use this tape all the time. Easy to roll out and cut, and the tape works really well. I have used this tape for years to seal up cardboard cartons of Christmas decorations year-in and year-out, as I move them back and forth from the storage cube to my home. The tape stays on and holds tight during all of the lifting and carrying of the heavy cartons. I don't have to waste tape by applying multiple layers of it. I've also used this tape many times for sealing up packages for both the mail and for shipping. Once sealed, the tape stays in place and I don't have to worry about either the carrier rejecting the package because of its wrapping, or the wrapping opening up during transit. The tape being clear doesn't interfere with any of the writing that might be on the package. The tape holder is convenient and easy to use.Scotch Packaging Tape, in my opinion, is worth buying over the generic tape versions out there. It's a sturdy, well-designed tape that does precisely what it is supposed to do. This is great shipping tape at a great price. I highly recommend this tape. No tape required here. Put your tape away. Make certain that you always have enough tape on hand to return any unwanted, broken, or unidentifiable items that you receive from Amazon.Well, you can see how I make use of this Scotch Heavy Duty Paking Tape. So, I get out the trusty tape and do it myself. The tape holds boxes together well and gets the box where it is going. I buy the tape. I use the tape. Great tape that works just as it should.Sign up and check it out for youself. If you are not happy with this, get one of those tape  gun thingies and shoot yourself in YOUR foot. YOU DO like this tape. The tape is good and I hope you try it and like it. The tape does not break off like the cheaper brands and sticks to even the most difficult surfaces. The OfficeMax tape is fine. This Heavy Duty tape is sturdier than all the rest, though, and it sticks very well. Scotch always has made, imho, the best tape products out there. You can easily place the tape on the end of the box and using the tape frame drag the tape all around the box using only one hand. This is great tape. I have found Scotch packing tape to be one of the easiest to use. The tape holds up for anything I need. I usually get shipping tape at the big-box stores. The tape used on the four boxes I got was the light-weight stuff that I usually use for light products. I love packing tape. However, the tape works well. What can you say, this tape is awesome. The tape is strong, yet easy to tear off a piece to the length you desire. I am a tape snob. This tape is a lot better and easier to use than tape I recently bought from USPS. This tape is amazing; clear, sticky, and strong. I use this tape all the time. This tape is thicker than less expensive tapes. Nice tape at a good price. Often when tape refuses to stick to the box, one can wrap it around to meet itself because it will stick to itself.

The tape comes on a simple, plastic dispenser that is lightweight and functional.
