The old staplers were made so well and with better steel, they did not bend or jam easy. I'm not exactly sure what it is, but's different from the Swingline staplers that I've been using over the years. It works well, but I don't think it will last as long as the staplers I've used over the years. I own other staplers, and my absolute favorite is one with a grip, like pharmacies use. I previously owned one of these staplers for several years. After quickly going through several staplers that kept jamming, I spent some time carefully reading reviews, both on and off Amazon, and bought one of these in 2010. Sure there are cheaper staplers but get this one--it's worth it. If you like picking up staplers and using them in your hand, you might consider a smaller, lighter unit that has curves for your hands.But on you desk, this one continues to rule. I have been using one from the 70s because of this: I continue to buy new staplers and they're useless within a year, whether they're permanently jammed, shooting out bent up staples, you name it.This Swingline 747 stapler has brought back the quality from the past. I've got two staplers at work, both from Swingline. I love my Swingline staplers, and get upset whenever someone tries to take mine.They're built to less, and I've had no jams whenever using Swinglines.This 747 "classic" stapler is pretty much the same thing, constructed in a smooth matte finish, but what I don't like about it is that it has a rectangular head. My other staplers have a smoother finish that makes it look sleeker.Functionality-wise, there's no difference; it's just personal preference. Who knew staplers are not built the same, despite having a sole purpose? This is just like the classic staplers I'd seen and used in my teachers' classrooms, only with a slightly updated design and a few feature tweaks.Pros:* Make primarily of metal, sturdy design* Holds a bucketload of staples* Can handle stapling 10 sheets without batting an eyelash, and 15-20 if you put some effort in* Unhinges so you can staple on a flat surface* Non-slip rubber grip on the bottomNeutral (or, rather, design tweaks):* You must press a latch on the bottom to unhinge rather than simply pulling the stapler open at the hinge* Stapling a lot in a short succession may result in a store palm with a square-ish indentation (ask me how I know)--in other words, square metal = uncomfortableOverall, I love this stapler and find myself using it more often than my other handheld Swingline. I have used staplers like this for decades.

It is a little pricier than some staplers but is well made and will last.

I basically quit using staplers some time ago as I found them frustrating and unreliable.

I have one of these exact same staplers from decades ago.
