We found it better to waste a label than throw away a large box. With one perfectly sized label,  I cover all the old information,  and now have no fears of confusion when I ship the box back.I also ship things to family and friends overseas,  and have these perfect sturdy boxes that the post office doesn't like me to use,  because they have company markings on them. This label won't peel off once it's stuck. And yes, since your label is the same color as the cardboard box, your label tends to disappear and not stand out. This label idea is so simple you wonder why no one thought of it before. So, if you are looking for a brown label to complete the look of your Recycled / Earth Friendly message, then this unbleached brown color may give you the upper hand. It fit very nicely, and the label proved itself to be perfectly opaque. But the don't really work if you print postage on the label, such as with Endicia or UPS or FedEx. I even used a blank label to cover up some old printing that was on a box. The label did seem to be easily removed with a minimal amount of effort. Instead of now having to tear off every label on the box, I can simply cover up the label with a matching label. It's a label, and it's from Avery. This label is ideal for shipping. It is a good sized label and with the software templates available from Avery.com, it is a breeze to set them up and print them out. Each label has nicely rounded corners on all 4 sides of each label. I recommend that you print in LARGE BOLD LETTERS since the label is not white. I was able to print one label, remove it, and then feed the full 8 1/2 inch page back through the printer to print on the other one. So I almost exclusively judge how much I like about a label by whether or not it peels off.And these stay stuck. I chose a multicolored "fragile" label and printed it from my Epson injket. This printed label will survive the shipping process nicely.I doubt anyone on this planet needs this product, but if you fancy this something fun to play with, I highly recommend it. If I forget to fold it when printing the label through Paypal, it would print out the receipt as well, causing to waste a perfectly good label, so you want to watch out for that! I prefer a white label, that will stand out and be easily found by the shipping company.But these are very handy for those of us who like to reuse boxes and have a hard time cleaning up the box enough for re-use (the Post Office is getting pickier about such things).There are 25 sheets in the box, so this is in the ballpark of 50 cents per sheet or 25 cents per label... more than "nothing", but it's way easier than trying to black things out with a marker and not that expensive. And make them compatible with online label printing services (UPS, USPS, etc.). You can also use it to cover up the old label and then put a white one on top of it if you are concerned about your label or writing not showing. I don't want my mailing label camouflaged! That seemed odd; why couldn't you just cover it up with another white label?Then the fog lifted.

That means they cover just about any other label or markings you may have on an existing box.Secondly, it also means they are easy to print up using your computer.

Admittedly, the label was a bit large for this purpose; I used a standard envelope (about 8"x12"), and the label pretty much covered it entirely, but since it was a used envelope, I considered that to be a good thing.

Now I can just use one big label and cover the whole thing.Not only that, but a small business could simply use this for marketing their product ON the address label instead of ordering boxes imprinted with their company.
