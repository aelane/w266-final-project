The Avery 5.5x8.5 binder is surprisingly versatile, as it holds half sheets. This binder is great if you, a) like the smaller page size (half of an 8.5 x 11) and b) carry little extras with you like index cards, a small ruler, post it notes and so forth. I didn't notice that when I ordered it.I love a good binder and Avery does make great products. But really what do you want this binder for? This binder is a good, solid product, that doesn't seem like it will fall apart. It's small, has 3 sturdy binder clips and even has an inside pocket for pens, a calculator, a nail file, etc. That would make this binder much more user friendly.I would have given it 5 stars if it was packaged as I described. the binder also fits day-timer refills of the same size. right in the binder. This is an excellent binder and holds a lot for its size. This is a very nice, sturdy binder, similar to the standard size binders, but smaller: a sort of "mini me" binder. This is a great little binder to carry with you for catalog reviews, printed databases, large address books or project management, as it will easily fit in a backpack, briefcase or purse. I'm very glad to have a small three ring binder to keep real paper things in and keep them in order. This makes the mini binder really useful.Good job, Avery! This smaller binder won't hold regular size paper of course, but it is great for small items such as photos, poetry, etc. I did not receive either and so am only reviewing the binder as a solution to my particular need for a half-size binder.This binder offers considerable improvements over a generic half-siize binder without costing a whole lot more. As this binder is only 5.5 x 8.5 with 1 inch thickness it is definately a specialty size, probably best suited as a day planner. This binder from Avery is very easy to store and handle because it is small unlike the big ones. The binder holder is very strong and this can be taken anywhere or stored just at home. The binder will help keep your thoughts and notes organized and prevent the loss of important information.Joseph B. Hoyos This binder is an OK product. This allows the binder to open flat, but I myself have never liked these rings that attach in this manner. The binder rings do close well and the snap open ends work well without too much strength needed to close and open them.Inside the back pocket there is a 3-1/4" deep flat plactic pocket attached. There was only the binder. This binder is a useful size for me - it takes sheets that are 1/2 the usual size. It is much easier than carrying around a full-sized binder. However, all I received was an empty binder. This is a very nice binder, if you need to store half-size sheets of paper. I've been using this binder as a sort of catch-all for in-progress tasks: grocery lists, recipes I want to try, guest list for a party, etc. This nice binder definitely fills a need for storage of small loose leaf pages and small items in one neat place. This binder has the little pocket folder in the front flap. This is a well made little binder that fulfills its product description in every detail. This Avery binder is nice and sturdy. This little binder holds half-sheets of paper. Also, the binder has tabs at the top and bottom for convenient opening. This is a handy and durable little binder. This binder is the perfect size for storing and organizing notes, household projects, or using in the workplace. I think this binder will prove to be invaluable in such settings. This little, 5.5 & 8.5, binder is a great size and handily holds collections of smaller objects, papers etc. If you are looking for just an ordinary 5.5 x 8.5 binder, I see no reason to recommend this over any other sturdy binder. This little binder will keep your papers secure, and the size is very convenient. Not very discreet, especially if you plan to use this binder in a library or classroom. This binder is a very convenient, portable size. I received this binder free to review as a part of the Amazon Vine program. Plus with this binder standard size paper does not fit so that would be an extra cost for small paper or else you could cut to fit some 8 X 11 size paper yourself. The binder clips have small protrusions so that the clips always close. If you are looking for a full-sized binder this is not for you! That being said, the binder does what it's advertised to do: sturdy, small size, compact, with a compartment for miscelaneous items. This is a very practical and useful binder! The binder is very sturdy, and the rings open and close securely. The binder would be great as a journal or coupon holder, as you could keep paper and writing utensils in the pouch, and the whole thing is small enough to carry or put in a purse or backpack.

The binder is of standard construction of vinyl over cardboard and holds 1/2 sized paper (8.5x5.5).

The binder rings are mounted to the back and not the spine which makes it a little wider.

Second, if you close the binder with the paper open (that is to say like a book that is open with some pages on the left and some on the right), during closing, those on the left get snagged by the button and can wrinkle or rip.
