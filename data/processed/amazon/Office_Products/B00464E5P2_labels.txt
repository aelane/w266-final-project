That makes the tapemuch more affordable.What I don't like: Sticky on the DYMO labels is not nearly as sticky as the Brother labels.The good thing about that is when removing a label from paper the DYMOlabel does not have a tendency to tear the folder paper. )The labels go from app to printed very quickly. So far I have made a LOT of labels with the roll that came with it and haven't had to replace it yet.Love this little thing. The labels are clear and sharp.If you're like me and prefer to type on a computer, as opposed to a small unit keyboard and screen, you will probably like this unit. The labels themselves are modestly sticky, with a split back that makes pealing these labels fairly easy.A "light" version of the label software comes with the label maker, while a more robust version can be downloaded for free. It accepts 3/8", 1/4", and 1/2" labels. I liked the Epson since it is very feature rich, but I find it very difficult to customize the labels using the small LCD display on the unit. I use it to print labels for my manila file folders, hanging file folder tabs, and 3 ring binder spines. The first few labels I printed were unusable, because the print was so spotty - every other letter was printed. This is perfect if you only need basic one-line labels that will end up on paper or other stay-stuck surfaces. If you're looking to cut 1" labels, look elsewhere, because it can't handle tape that wide, but if you want to label whatever with an easy-to-use unit that prints well seconds after you plug it in, then this is a great option. If you need labels, this little gadget is just what you need. It prints decent, simple labels. They also do not look like they have iron-on labels, if that's something you need (the Epson LabelWorks does have them). If you want fancier, you can get it free from Dymo.Easy to switch out labels (if you want different sizes).It is small and portable.You can see which tape you have loaded in a little window.Bad:The labels included do NOT make good "flags" (another reviewer noted this and I tested it myself). It makes perfectly decent labels. There are other labels available in different sizes 1/4", 1/2", 3/8", different color options as well as Flexible, Permanent ones.Overall - I find this easy to install and use.

On two-line labels, the label centers both lines, which I really like.

If you tend to make the same labels, like an address label, often, then this feature is extremely valuable.

If you want to make labels suitable for addresses you will need a printer that can accommodate 1" labels.
