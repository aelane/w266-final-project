They slide easily into hanging folders and remove easily as well. I had been using the regular Smead hanging folders with plastic removable tabs for years. Then the folders disappeared in plain sight. They can be easily clipped onto your folders and positioned anywhere. I use folders a lot and really like that I can flip through these, over and over, without worrying that they will pop out, fall apart or fall off. It grips even plain folders well enough that it would require some force to remove. They are great for filing and seem to work with different folders as we have a couple of different types in our filing system. If you have file folders that need tabs for descriptions so you can organize or index things, these tabs are a nice add-on. I'm sold on these, they work well and I'll be using these going forward on my handing file folders. This means if I ever wanted to re-label the folders, it would be a slight chore to remove the old insert and slide in the new one. They don't bend or crack easily  - not even as I've been moving the folders from box to box, sliding them up and down, backwards and forwards, etc.2. I was able to reuse many perfectly good folders this way.3. These are great for hanging folders and even file folders that need to stand out.Labels slip easily into the tab and the angle of the tab makes them easy to read from a variety of angles.The way these attach with pressure points give endless possibilities for use:- attaching to a steno / note pad to keep track of place or label the pad- attach to thin metal desk files as a way to easily change labels without using adhesive labels that fray- any edge about the thickness of a hanging file (even slightly thicker) that needs a way to be labeled -- these might just fit the bill.While I like how they work on hanging folders I keep looking at my office space thinking there must be other ways to use them. Most of the hanging folders I have purchased include tabs for labeling, so these were a bit redundant for my needs.

If your hanging folders don't have the little tab inserts - it certainly doesn't matter with these slide tabs.Also, they are so sturdy that if you have a lot of files or your often "thumb through" your files, they won't bend or come dislodged easily.They are the same size as my old color coded tabs, but perhaps because they are longer, they seem "bigger" and make my files easier to organize and the the names of the folders seem to "pop" out more than my old tabs.At 3.24 for 18 (as I write this) - it is priced accordingly.

Even when positioned as described, they usually rested on the folders at a strange angle that made them hard to read.These tabs are AWESOME!

They also rest on the folders at an angle that can be easily read.
