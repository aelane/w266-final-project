When comparing box prices your do need to pay attention to the dimensions; they can be different and some are sold without the hanger bar. You do have to tape up the box on the bottom and top flaps. You have to turn the box upside down, tape up the bottom of the box, then turn it right-side up and insert the bar on top where it's notched. The box is sturdy, but probably wouldn't be used for multiple moves. This box worked just perfect for me. I recently moved and this box is great for clothes that need to be left on the hanger- They are heavy duty, and hold all my clothes well- Just moved from the hanger into my closet, to the box, back to my new house closet- Made it easy, was able to hold about 20 items of clothing ! Oh, and also be careful opening the box these are packed in, it makes another excellent packing box (I am using it for pictures). I used another box to store large Christmas decorations--they are ideal for motionettes or porch greeter dolls. The box wasn't too hard to move with the help of a dolly (I was working alone). This box will accommodate about 24 hanging shirts plus other items up to 40 inches long that you can slide down the sides of the box. The SmartMove box was very sturdy and easy to carry.
