Bubble wrap comes straight out of the box just like silver foil or wax paper. I use this bubble wrap to protect smaller items that I ship all over the country. I bought this particular bubble wrap for two reasons: I wanted a good quality bubble wrap and I wanted a larger quantity. I got both with this wrap. I'll buy this bubble wrap again. This bubble wrap is no different. Not really much more to ask for, it's just bubble wrap. Bubble wrap in neatly perforated squares! This bubble wrap is quite a bargain, especially compared to what it costs at a local office supply store. Even though the bubble wrap is in a box, that box is placed in a larger box for shipping...it's like Amazon is throwing in a box for free!I always buy perforated bubble wrap now - it reduces the time to it takes to wrap items. Quality bubble wrap, worked well for protecting my stuff during shipment... but...not much can stop UPS and the way they throw around your packages like a sport. Bought their bubble wrap and box based on their recommendations and paid for the shipping. no bubble wrap can save you from UPS, but this is good quality bubble wrap. I love packing with bubble wrap.
