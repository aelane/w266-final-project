There are five removable folders and the filer does not expand. I've used folders in the past but he tended to abandon them pretty quickly. There are several folders inside that can be taken out so you can adjust the compartments and/or use the folders independently. It is easier to pull the folders out, in order to work with them. It isn't very practical to have to pull the folders out every time you want to access them. The five different colored folders are well designed, as you can easily slide papers in and out of them, and since the folders are sealed at the bottom, when you take the folder(s) out, papers inside won't fall out. The 5 included folders are decent quality and durable. * It's labeled as having &#34;5 removable folders&#34; so I'm guessing it's meant for &#34;5 subjects.&#34; I actually use it for 9 or 10, because you can put another &#34;subject&#34; between the folders - IF you don't remove the folders. It has 5 folders that you can pull out. An you can use the in between the folders as extra pocket space, which I did cause I needed it. The individual folders do not hold many papers, so keep that in mind. The folders are tabbed with the vertical orientation, but when removed from the filer they can be opened like regular horizontal folders. (The folders and filer come tethered together, so you will have to cut the plastic thread to use and remove the folders. The folders have tabs on the top, so you could use them as dividers instead of folders. the folders are inserted sideways.

The folders are plastic so just pop a sticker on the tab and write what that folder is for.
