The pink pen writes in light red ink, the lilac one in purplish blue. I received this from VINE, thinking it was a pretty pink pen, "jeweled, sparkly and easy to find in a purse". I have the pink one and the purple one. The pink one was a slow starter for me, but after a few circles on a page, it writes well. They come in pink and purple (with corresponding pink and purple ink), and they have a nice scrollwork/floral design. The pink ink is rather light, lighter than some other pink pens I've tried. I personally cannot see how writing in pink or purple ink would be acceptable, but my wife loves the ink colors, and says that she just uses them at home, not at work. They have a stylish pink and purple jewel accented silhouette and a comfortable soft contoured pearl studded grip. What I love most was the pink and purple ink - the ink color is bright and eye-catching. Several of us agreed that it was nice to have pink and purple inks that were not hard on the eyes to read, my biggest complaint with most inks in those colors. Would have been happy with an attractive solid pink or pastel. I am a pink and purple lover and these pens have a very pretty white lacy design over the pink or purple; looks like scroll work I would put on a scrapbook page. They write in light pink or purple and I haven't seen any blotting or smudges. They are definitely girly, with pink and purple ink and cute little matching designs on the barrels. The pink and purple colors are nice as well.

The pink one left blobs of ink at the end of the word.

Better than the pink pen.These are okay, I don't think I'd seek them out to purchase.

If I was 13 or 14, I would have loved the pink and purple ink.
