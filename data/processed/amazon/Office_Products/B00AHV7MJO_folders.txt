I just love these folders! I've used some hanging folders that were incredibly flimsy, but these are thick and nice!I also love that I don't have to worry about those little tabs I normally have to attach to hanging folders or the little slips of paper that slide in there.These are great! I was interested in these because I have several hanging folders that don't have tabs at all. If you need folders, Smead also offers the erasableSuperTab folders(assorted sizes) with built-in erasable tabs. These are great "FasTab Hanging folders" that are step-savers and very user-friendly. That's why these 'erasable' folders appealed to me.Unfortunately, after messing with them for a while, I've come to the conclusion that I'm probably better off sticking with labels. The folders are nice and strong and promise to be durable. Who said that hanging folders have to come with removable tabs, so you have to assemble three pieces to make a working folder? These folders buck the trend and the result is an easy to use folder that stands up to abuse. Considering how infrequently I relabel hanging folders, I can easily live with this. I have been using hanging folders for too many years to name at work as well as at home. These hanging folders are just like Smeads other hanging folders:  Durable paper material, crisp folds, metal hangers that don't easily bow in the middle under a heavy load. First, the folders are well built hanging folders with metal hanging strips that run the full length of the top side-to-side. Some cheaper folders don't have full metal tabs, but these do. The folders are of nice weight and promise to be useful over time.The Smead folders I was currently using were $15.45 for a box of 25; so these erasable folders are a bit more expensive, but in this case I believe the increase in price is warranted based on the frustration free ease of repeated use.I highly recommend these to replace previous hanging folders and for future use of new folders. I just wish I had found these folders sooner!Highly recommended, great product! The Smead erasable FasTab hanging folders, made in the USA, are designed with reusable tabs. I'm always using folders. So in all, these are nice folders, just don't buy them for the erasable part. I have had folders that ripped in that area plenty of times before.This is a great item. Also not as loud as other the colored folders that are out there.The quality of the construction is what I would expect from the Smead name. Like the Smead SuperTab folders this is an interesting product that seems to work fine. I use hanging folders for my "household" files and like being able to erase and reuse folders.I would like to see a small eraser included since they aren't talking your standard pencil eraser.

The new erasable folders from Smead are a great idea with a plastic film over the label area so they can be written on and then erased so they could be used over and over again if they work.The product description here on Amazon says use a standard white eraser but more detailed instructions are included with the folders.

The folders are a nice weight, so I think they will last a long time.

I use hanging folders in my home office and mine look disorganized in part because I really dislike inserting and updating folder tabs.
