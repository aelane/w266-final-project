The hooks slide easier than the rougher metal hooks and seem just as sturdy. And rather than bend the hooks slide smoothly and stay in line. These hooks STAY ON TRACK so I can stay on track!They also slide easily and are MUCH QUIETER than the high pitched scraping sound of the older metal on metal hooks.I do like these very much, and I've used these folders now for many months and can say they fit perfectly for the job they were meant to do. The hooks are soft and finger friendly, they don't come out of the folders, and they are far lighter and easier to handle than the metal ones. They feature sturdy flexible hooks and include computer compatible printable sheet on which you can customize your own tab inserts. Similarly the hooks are also strong to keep up with the load. The Surehook "hooks" are made from a study plastic (maybe even a plastic coated metal, but I don't know that for sure). The hooks don't just fall out either (as some of my older ones do when I tip the folder). The hooks have some give (by design) to them, so they flex better when we put a lot in them. The "sure hooks" are much thicker than regular files and the material of the folder is reinforced onto the hangers, so they're not going to break under normal wear and tear situations even with reasonably heavy loads. * The hooks are plastic and have tension. The hooks do not torque like older wire hooks. The hooks also don't scrap the skin, either. The hooks are also plastic and of a longer size than usual.
