Special paper tends to wear and tear on these desktop printers. For those who don't need two paper trays, you might consider the 3420, with one tray; the two printers cost about the same, though. As soon as I turned it on it said there was a paper jam. I had not even loaded paper or run anything through it yet so I knew it was an error. It is fairly compact, works well and rather quietly, and so far it has been very reliable (barring the initial paper jam error). This may be because the paper is static clinging, but it seemed to happen with a variety of paper types.Still loud - I'm always amazed at how all these printer improvements have been made over the years but they're still so noisy!Ink, ink, ink - they advertise that the ink lasts longer, but I have an older "workforce model" and I can tell you already based on how quickly this one is using up black ink, that it's not "extra long lasting" as the adverts would have you believe. Two paper trays are nice.I'm loving the ability to print double sided copies- perfect for those recipe sites that tack on things at the end that require two pieces of paper but you end up throwing the second one away since it only has a small acknowledgement or ad at the end.It's a touch loud while printing at times but is so quick that it's not that big of a bother. And this has two paper trays!! Theprinter paper capacity is a generous 500 sheets; however, I doubt if anyone would ever loadthat much. Too much paper tends to compress the stack, thus negating the standard fanningoperation to loosen paper sheets. I guess paper does matter!I haven't printed from the smartphone (as I don't have one) so I can't comment on that. You can also feed paper from other areas.The scanning quality seems to be very good. You do not have to flip the paper over & re-insert it. The paper handling is excellent with two front trays plus rear feed for envelopes, labels, card stock and specialty media. The paper handler is quiet (a little too quiet) and efficient. And, its paper tray holds over 500 sheets before needing to add more paper. I get the occasional paper jam, but, the touch screen tells you exactly how to go about fixing it. But truthfully, I haven't had paper jams with a WorkForce printer, so I'm quite pleased with this printer after several weeks of use!Scanning was easy and is wireless. Especially loading paper from the top section, everything was easy to do.Can I think of anything negative? Grabs paper easy and had no issues at all. I have used the rear paper feed for labels and envelopes without issues. It has two paper trays, holds an entire ream (500 sheets) of paper, and can accommodate all sorts of paper sizes. So I can keep photo paper or card stock or envelopes in it to use without changing them out so often. Photos, especially on photo paper, are decent but obviously not the quality you'd get from a good true photo-dedicated inkjet like Epson's Stylus Pro series. Not real happy with paper management.For no apparent reason, it frequently stops printing in the middle of the page, sits and thinks about it for a minute, and then spits out your half-printed page. I can't begin to guess how much high-end paper and ink I have wasted with this boat anchor today. Load some paper if you wish to do so.Now, go back to your computer and install the drivers and software you just downloaded.

The paper capacity of the 3540 is more than that of the 4530 (surprisingly given the size of the two units).

The second is that you can close the rear paper feed to keep dust from getting in.

If you attempt to use the paper alignment edges in the paper tray to feed it straight, they center up your half sheet and it only prints half of your invoice.
