And the desktop dispenser is great. The desktop dispensers that come with this set holds two refills, and the suction cup bottom sticks to most surfaces without any problems. The desktop suction pad is not sticky, but sticks to my desk quite tightly. Two desktop non skid dispensers that actually suction on to the surface, they come preloaded with two sets of tape. It comes with 2 desktop dispensers and 2 that slip over your hand. I wrapped a present using both the desktop and handband dispenser and in my opinion  the handband dispenser is more convenient just because it frees up your hands, it's also very comfortable and easy to use. Overall, I prefer the desktop suction device, although I think the hand device is also great when you're not wrapping on a flat surface. I like the desktop dispensers better than the wrist dispensers. The desktop dispenser is very convenient, however I found the wrist dispenser to be cumbersome for the most part while wrapping presents. I think I would opt to buy just the desktop dispensers and not the wrist piece in the future. The desktop dispenser works reasonably well. taping experience.The desktop dispensers use a round flap of soft vinyl on the back which creates a tiny bit of suction on the table. 1 star.The desktop dispensers are another matter entirely.
