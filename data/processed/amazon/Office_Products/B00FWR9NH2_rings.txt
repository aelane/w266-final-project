You can open the three rings with one finger and you can also design your own cover and insert it into the clear plastic cover on the binder.I received this binder in white as well as black. The rings are perfectly aligned.However, this would not be a notebook to overstuff since the rings are not the heavy duty type to endure much pressure. The rings on the inside are round, personally, I prefer D rings, but they close and open easily. When you open or close the rings you can easily do it with one finger and when the rings close they align perfectly so paper doesn't come out of the hooks. ), D shaped rings, pockets, add your own inserts on the front/sides/back. The rings are okay and they snap open easily. I prefer the rings centered on the spine so that your documents are all kept neatly inside the binder. We are always stuck with rings that become loose and create gaps once we fill the binders, so this product was extra appealing due to the fact that it claims to have heavy duty rings and durable hinges. The rings are literally gap free, they stay tight even with the one finger press to easily open them. Once closed, you cannot open the rings unless you open it with the bottom lever. The &#8220;D&#8221; rings hold more paper than the normal round rings. The rings open easily, and it has insert pockets galore so you can slip sheets in to customize it on the front, spine, back, inside, as well as keeping a few extra sheets in the inside pockets. The rings always meet without prodding. the rings are easier to open than other binders - less finger pinching, which is good for me.inside, there are 2 pockets (on both the front and back covers) to put things in - papers, thumb drives, etc.the plastic is a tad thin, which makes me concerned the pockets may tear. This seems very durable, and the rings are easy to open and close. I am impressed with how easy it is to open up the rings. It's nice that they are completely clear.The rings work well. It's nice to have the rings on the back cover and not the spine. So far the rings have not come apart or become uneven, but I've only been using it for about a month. The very easy to operate rings may be important to someone with hand problems, so that alone may make this binder worth the price. The O-shaped rings are on the back inside cover instead of the spine, so your paper are less likely to get bent.There are 2 pockets on the inside of each cover - the 3" deep pocket you expect and one behind it that's about 6" deep. It makes it easy to open and close the rings. The rings click open effortlessly with the touch of a &#34;button&#34; and close the same way, which means my kids can use this binder without me and I don't have to worry about them pinching fingers.2.) It also has  circular rings but they  do have the more desirable dimple to hollow closure. The rings also close tightly and pages don't tend to get caught on them while being turned. The rings are very easy to open and close with just one hand. Finally, I love that the rings are mounted on the back cover rather than on the spine so that my pages stay nice and flat while in use. The rings pop open easily, close easily and stay shut.

Closing the rings is easier if you just pinch the rings themselves back together; there's a lot of resistance on the lever if you try to push it back to the closed position.
