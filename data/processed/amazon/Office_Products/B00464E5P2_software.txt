The software supports three label sizes: 1/4 inch, 3/8 inch, and 1/2 inch. However, the included software is quite basic, and one will want to download the full version 8 program, which has all sorts of great features, including Outlook address book integration and the capability to save labels. Eventually I went back to the LITE software and was able to get it to download from there - but it is hardly intuitive.- The replacement cartridges are somewhat pricey.Recommendation:If you need to print a lot of labels from your computer, this is a good choice. I love that you don't have to permanently install the software for this label maker on your computer. The software is easy to use. The software launched effortlessly on my rather finicky macbook (this old gray/white mac ain't what she used to be but I'm not ready to upgrade yet) and the program is, for the most part, a very specific (to this printer) and pared down edition of the Dymo software that I use with my Labelwriter 400 Turbo. Since the software is built-in, there is no installation required.The software that comes with the label-printer is simple to use and includes standard features similar to other word-processing programs. You don't need to install software on your drive, so this unit is really convenient all the way around.You don't have the ability to custom design your labels without limit, nor do you have a great variety of label sizes you can print.I use this to label all my burned disks, boxes and folders for my home business and it works really well for that.

The software is simple and limited in what you can do, but I need a label maker for files, boxes headed into storage, and cable labels. I even re-installed the software, but that didn't help either.What did help was going to the Dymo Web site [...] and downloading a free software program called v.8 containing additional drivers.The Pnp program that initially installs is called Dymo Label Light and it just didn't work in my computer running Windows-7. When its on, the software is there on my desktop, and when it's turned off, the software goes away. The built in DYMO Light software prints simple one line labels. The included basic software can access all the fonts installed on your computer, and font sizes can be increased or decreased.
