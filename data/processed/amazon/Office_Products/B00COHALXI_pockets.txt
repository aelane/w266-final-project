needed layered pockets to work well as a binder...fine for note-booking though It has abundant pockets (both inside and out), as well as pen holders and Velcro closings on some of the pockets, which means you can store loose items easily, too.The blue covering is perfect for either sex, and makes an attractive presentation. Inside, there's 3 pockets and a velcro pouch. Very spacious and the inside pockets held loose papers without slipping out. Personally, I like my extra zipper pockets on the INSIDE of my binder - but that's just what I like. I wish there were more pockets--I like a lot of sneak little Velcro pockets, but there are a few. There are two outside pen pockets, so you can always grab a pen easily without having to dig around for it, as well as a double elastic pen holder inside the pencil case. It is attractive and colorful, and has helpful little zipper/velcro pockets for the various novelty erasers and nonsense they all want to carry at this age, and interior pockets to shove papers and work to be filed or dealt with later (let's be realistic here folks). I really liked the pockets, zippers, and the pen holders on the outside ~ beats having to unzip the binder to rifle around for a pen. The two inside large pockets will hold and iPad, including a cover that has a keyboard. The pockets are placed such that there is no way the pockets and thus the iPad, could come in contact with the three rings when the binder is closed. Inside are two large document pockets, plus a smaller one with Velcro closure. The inside slash pockets are fine, and the rings on the binder close at the moment. Aside from its numerous, generous pockets, its biggest advantage is that it zips to close all the way around it, making it less likely that, dropped, it will spill its contents all over the place. I personally like the outside pen pockets and the small unzip outer pocket would be good for a phone, keys, sunglasses, makeup or just pens.
