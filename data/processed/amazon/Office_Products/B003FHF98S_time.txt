These are great for wrapping, especially this time of year.The elastic strap fits your wrist, or hand (I wear mine on the back of my hand), and when they are empty, they take only a few seconds to reload.Prevents the usual tape snagging, and wasting, but does only give pre measured small strips, so if you're doing a big parcel, use the old fashioned reel.You do use a lot more tape I think, with smaller pieces for example, I tend to use five or six pieces to do just one end of a box shaped present, but then again, being able to use both hands and then just a quick tug for the tape is worth it.If you figured out exactly how much tape you get in a pack, or refill pack I'm sure it's about 3 times the price of regular tape, but the convenience makes it a winner.Also very good for kids to use, without them wasting tons of tape, or fighting over the reel.4 stars The Scotch Pop-Up Tape Dispenser and Refills arrived just in time for me to use it while wrapping Christmas presents, and I'm pleased to say both the tabletop and back-of-the-hand versions work just as advertised. )This time, however, Scotch gets it right. Pre-cut so it saves time and I am the kind who invariable cuts my finger on the razor type edge of tape dispenser. This does save time and makes the job easier. Just in time for the Christmas season!If you're like me -- all thumbs at best when wrapping gifts -- these handy dispensers are just what you're looking for. This Scotch Pop-Up Tape Dispenser and Refills set arrived just in time for me to use it while wrapping my first batch of Christmas presents. And luckily for me I get to try these just in time to wrap the towering tree of Christmas gifts and really put this product through its paces.There is a Handband dispenser and let me tell you it's perfect when wrapping those gifts that require more than one hand to hold closed the end papers. This came just in time for me to try it out on some presents I needed to wrap and mail out. Just in time for wrapping gifts as well as sealing Holiday cards, the clever folks at 3M has come up with pop-up tape in refillable dispensers that attach to your wrist or sit on a table. They are WONDERFUL at Christmas time (I hate, hate, hate wrapping).That said, I don't like the desk dispensers. And just in time for the holidays too! I believe that all of us at one time or another have found ourselves trying to tear a piece of tape with one hand while holding paper in place with the other. This arrived in time for me to use while wrapping up some gifts.I have seen this product a time or two, but supposed it wasnot really worth changing my ways in order to try it. Every time I tried to save money by buying an off brand, I wasted my money. But when it came time to pick the latest product to review, I thought to myself, "Christmas is coming up, I could use some Scotch tape, let me give those things a try". With time, the dispenser becomes easier to open. It saves time and makes wrapping ever so much more efficient if I just have to give a short tug to obtain a perfectly sized piece of tape than having to wrestle with a traditional dispenser where the tape gets twisted and tangled. I received this just in time to get all the Christmas presents wrapped. This is my first time using this product and I used it initially to wrap Christmas gifts and I cannot believe how simple and easy this dispenser is.The tape is precut and the perfect size! Was it worth the time and effort? I could not have received this at a better time of year than now.
