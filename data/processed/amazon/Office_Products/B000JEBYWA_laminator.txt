The laminator itself has an on and off switch, but there is one direction for ON that is for documents that are 3 mils thick and one for documents that are 5 mils thick. The laminator also comes with some laminating sheets so you can start a project right away. This laminator is great! For a laminator it is pretty good. Very happy with this laminator and would recommend it to anyone for light to moderate use. The second obituary almost jammed in the laminator. I've been using this laminator for photos and kids artwork. I really like this laminator for our small office. Fellowes Saturn SL95 9.5IN Office Laminator is a very nice laminator. If you never use a laminator before, please read the manual. What can you do with a laminator? Seemed kinda messy so I wondered what would happen if I ran it through the laminator. The laminator came with ten 3-mil letter-size pouches which was nice so I didn't have to go hunting for laminating sheets right away.I don't particularly like the design however. I would still recommend this laminator.

Overall, I am impressed by how well this works even though I had never owned a laminator before and there's really no comparison to make.
