That means the four "basic" colors don't bring much value other than being able to write in a "normal" color using the same set.However, the remaining 40 pens are remarkable. The colors look really nice. I love the colors in the TEKwriter USA Gelwriter Gel Pen set. I am not sure what I am going to do with all the colors, some are very light and wouldn't be good for writing, would not show up very well. I love all the colors. 44 colors I can't wait to use them all. The colors are bright and rich.There was a note included with pens stating that there is some new technology used with the pen so they do not dry out as easily as other gel pens. I love all the colors and how smooth they write without any skipping, and the result looks very professional. The colors are just gorgeous. All different colors and they all write very well. I enjoy drawing and found using the various colors to be somewhat addictive. But many of the colors are "glittery" and that was a plus all by itself.This would be a great summer surprise to give to kids when school vacation boredom sets in. It has all the colors anyone could hope for. It has so many colors that some of the shades are so close it is hard to tell the difference. And the colors are really brilliant and striking. The colors are super vibrant and saturated there are even glitter gel pens in this set which are probably the most fun. So thrilled I picked these and want to know how to replace the colors as I use them so I never have an incomplete set! There are several great contemporary colors.

All colors can easily be seen by the design of the stand.
