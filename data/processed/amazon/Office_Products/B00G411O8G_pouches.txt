I just recently used these pouches to laminate some 8x11 name signs for doors. These are THERMAL laminating pouches and require heat. These laminating pouches produced near-perfect results. I will be purchasing more of these pouches. These laminating pouches work great with my Scotch laminator. These laminating pouches work just as they should with my inexpensive laminator. The pouches are such a bargain price for 100. These pouches are 3 ml which make them the standard thickness for laminating pouches. The pouches are easy to use and they are perfect to laminate a letter size document or picture. I highly recommend these laminating pouches for anyone who laminates. These pouches are fantastic -- great quality and hold up very well over time. Nothing special to report about these pouches, but they run through the laminator without a problem, come out the other side well sealed and without bubbles.Of course, the operator can mess up the results with any brand hot laminating pouch, so do it properly and these Swingline pouches will do the job for youI would advise that you look at the 100 sheet pack however, it's only a few dollars more for twice the amount. I used these pouches to laminate papers from standard 20-lb copy paper up to card stock. These laminating pouches are 3 mil thick. These are great laminating pouches that provide a thick and sturdy result. The pouches are easy to use, with a single opening and feed easily through the laminator. I used some of these Swingline pouches in my office laminator. The pouches stiffen up a bit and turn crystal clear and don't scratch after being heated by the laminator. Before I review these pouches, let me first revisit the statement I made when I reviewed my household personal laminator. These laminating pouches seem to get the job done for me. These pouches end up crystal clear after laminating and the lamination isn't too think so it's still flexible. These Swingline 4x6 pouches were exactly what we needed to protect pictures being shown to relatives at family reunions. These laminating pouches are durable and relatively scratch resistant to heavy use. These pouches are of a much more practical weight.They seemed to have a considerable amount of static electricity, which made it hard to separate the sheets and open the pouches. These Laminating pouches provide the perfect solution. These are as well made as more expensive pouches and they work quickly, stay together, and don&#8217;t split with general use. These are excellent laminating pouches, I have no complaints. Most pouches come in 3 mil (to laminate regular paper) or 5 mil (to laminate card stock, photos, and similar weight paper). These pouches can be handy for so many creative and practical uses! I found these laminating pouches to be very easy to use. My first thought as I pulled these pouches out of the package was &#34;These are really thin!&#34;. If you are looking for more durable pouches to use for placemats or other rough duty, look for the 5 mil size. The 4x6" pouches are much easier to use for these applications. I then need to trim them carefully so they look nice.Having 4x6 pouches solves a lot of the problem. The Swingline pouches work great. These pouches are a bit on the thin side compared to higher quality pouches. These laminating pouches are good quality. These are nice standard 3mm laminating pouches. These pouches are certainly worth keeping on hand. The pouches sealed in everything so it was crystal clear, there was no bubbling, and the pouches worked well with the Fellowes Personal Laminator I had. The Swingline pouches are adequate--they do the job, and they do a decent job of it. I also prefer 5mm pouches, but that's simply a matter of taste. The pouches are of good quality. The pouches are very easy to use. The pouches are easy to use, they open at the top and done both sides of the pouch for easy and accurate loading. These pouches were half the cost of what I normally pay in store, so I was excited to try them! Overall, these are nice laminating pouches that worked well for our home/school projects. Love the pouches. These pouches work great for that. I find laminating pouches to vary very little between brands. It's hard to get the pouches back inside. Aside from that, the pouches work as well as any other 3 mil pouch I've tried.Just open the pouch, insert paper and put the whole thing into the laminator with the closed side going through first. These Swingline pouches seem to work well. These pouches work great with my laminator and I have had no problems. These laminating pouches felt flimsy when I pulled them out of the package, but after laminating they are nice and sturdy, and crystal clear, with no bubbles or wrinkles. If the pouches were just a little larger, to provide a little room for error, they'd get five stars. Although the Swingline pouches seemed a bit 'cloudier' before lamination, they were brilliant and clear after lamination, just like the Fellowes. The Swingline pouches made a very nice looking product. The pouches arrived perfectly.For reference, I used these laminating pouches withthis Scotch thermal laminator. I compared these laminating pouches to Amazon's laminating pouches:http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Thermal-Laminating-Pouches-100-Pack/dp/B00BWU3HNY/I was surprised to find out that though quality is essentially exactly the same, with look and feel being equal, the cost for Swingline's version ends up being much higher.Amazon's current price at time of review was $12.99 per 100, whereas Swingline's is $15.99 per 100. Swingline's pouches are 1/4&#34; smaller on both the short and long sides.Overall I would definitely choose the Amazon laminating pouches. I used these laminating pouches with a Scotch Pro Laminator. Personally, I'd probably prefer to spend $12 on 100 Oregon Lamination pouches than $3.45 on 20 Swingline pouches, but then I have a lot of things I'd like to laminate. I use laminating pouches in this size mostly for decoration. I like these Swingline pouches just as well. I measured the pouches and they barely fit an 8 1/2" x 11" page, so you need to get the page to be laminated in perfectly so the sides have a small overlap for the laminator to seam. The pouches look a little cloudy but come out perfectly clear after being laminated. I use the pouches on a lot of crochet and knitting patterns and then don't have to worry about the pages ripping. These pouches are great for small projects especially cards and book separators. The pouches were easy to use, adhered nicely and I did not find any bubbling or separation. I find these pouches produce an excellent result at a good price and I'll purchase more.FYI: You can use these pouches in any brand of thermal laminating machine, but check the instructions with your particular machine for directions because some machines require you to use a paper "carrier" around your pouch during lamination and if you don't, you risk ruining your rollers. In all respects the "Swingline" Laminating Pouch is equal to the pouches included as original equipment with my laminator. These pouches have made them MUCH more durable.
