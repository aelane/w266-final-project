So I cannot speak to the complete product. Ok this is at best a silly product and at worst a bit of flim-flam. While this product is stated as being "Assembly free with Autobottom design," I missed being able to refer to specific directions as to how to set it up. Granted, I am not mechanically minded, but my product did not automatically fall into place on the bottom as I expanded its width and I did not have an easy time of it.That said, it also did not fit in my filing cabinet because it is too wide.That said, it is very suitable for desktop organizing, such as papers pertaining to one subject. This is a great new product from Smead. Great product, so let's get organized and start filing! This product was exactly what I expected. If the product was less expensive, I would rate it higher. This is a flimsy product. This product is good-looking and folds flat when you aren't using it. I selected this product to use for my home based business. This isn't a bad product but it's not great either. I was very disapointed with this product. this is a great product if you have an insane number of 'redwells' loitering around the office or home office - these file boxes arrive compact, but deploy quickly to store and organize at least a ream of paperwhile most of us have strived over the last 20 years to rid ourselves of mountains of paper, these boxes come in very handy to help organize us poor miscreants still tethered to the paper millsthis box was put to immediate use to store 2012's assortment of business income and expense receipts - now i'll be able to dump the entire collection on my CPA's desk, neatly stored inside this box instead of the New Balance shoe box i've used in the past...these boxes are also available in different colors, too!
