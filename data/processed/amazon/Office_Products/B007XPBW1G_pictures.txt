They measure 37 x 4 x 27 and they are well suited for small to medium sized pictures or mirrors. I boxed up some unused pictures and inserted them inside the delivery box (thanks to the ideas I read here) and then safely moved the pictures to our storage shed.Recommend.Penmouse I have quite a few pictures that need storing and these boxes are great for the job! Now that's actually pretty handy for the pictures I have. I had several large pictures and mirrors in the back of my closet that were wrapped in old sheets to protect them. My pictures and mirrors are very well protected now, so I don't have to worry that they will get damaged. Works great to keep the pictures from touching and to protect the edges as well.I did put flat pieces of cardboard directly onto the glass of each picture and then put thick bubblewrap on top of that to cover the entire frame. Every now and then one of our pictures will get nicked by the mysterious basement monster (nobody ever seems to know how it happens) and we've had a few that we chose not to even use again because it just looked too bad.

I'm using these to store some framed pictures while the wifey decides to "rotate" the pictures - these will make storage easier, and a lot better protected.Would recommend, even if a bit pricey...

These made moving pictures much easier.

Packing the pictures is always an issue, but with these it was a snap.
