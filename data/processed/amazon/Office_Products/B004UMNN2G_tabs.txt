I particularly like the built in tabs that you pull up. No scurrying around trying to find plastic tabs and inserts and then dealing with them breaking off or cracking. These tabs don't stand out as much and can't be color coded. The tabs are a great idea and seem to work very well. First, the tabs are very difficult to pull up into place. This is great since you don't have to worry about inserting those annoying plastic tabs used on other folders, or worse yet risk one of them falling out and having an unlabeled folder. Plastic tabs do fine (my current ones are pushing 10 years). I prefer colored tabs, to stand out from a folder's internal files and to organize by subject matter. No more trying to insert tabs into the notches. Loved the tabs popping out of the folder, now I don't have to paper cut myself putting those tabs in those little plastic holders.Excellent idea. These tabs are pretty small, but very adequate. I wrote directly on the tabs with a Sharpie, but a single set of printable tab labels comes with the box of folders. The ready tabs are easy to use with a felt tip pen, pencil or ball point.The tabs allow me to label the file without having to look for the paper inserts and plastic holder used on other folders. These tabs are already attached, just choose which of the 5 positions you want the tab to be in and fold up that one. Because of the numerous tabs as well as the various colors, this is a product anyone who is looking to organize their filing cabinet will be pleased with! I always hated how the tabs on my file holders would fall off, but this product has eliminated that. These are great, I really like it that I don't have to mess with those tabs. Those just stick on the tabs themselves instead of having to thread them through.The tabs also go back down should you decide to use that hanging folder for something else or reposition it within your file cabinet. The tabs are easy to read and write on.This product is all about the convenience, makes it easier to sort the folders by using the tab that won't be covered instead of having to rearrange the folders in the right sequence. The tabs are a neat concept as you can pull them up anywhere, making it easier to rearrange the file holders yet still keep them organized and visible. I like that the tabs are already in place, and I can re-use and move them around without the little plastic thingies falling out.Th color coding also helps me keep my files for our community center, homeschool, and house bills more accessible at a  glance. Ever buy file tabs, only to have them seem to lack the capacity or weightbearing strength so they can actually collapse. The individual tabs pull up or slide back down, making it much faster and easier to set up multiple file folders at once. The tabs are easy to insert and are held in pretty secure.

I was doubtful about how the tabs would actually work, and have found it a pleasantly easy and thus far long lasting solution.I was very happy to have the opportunity to obtain more of these folders and in assorted colors.

Love the clever pull-up tabs on these!

I have not used them long enough to determine if the tabs will stay up for identification or if they will slide down into their original slot yet.
