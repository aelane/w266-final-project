I have my Grandfather's Ellis Island Passenger Record stored in the display pocket.Sadly, I was surprised to discover that there was only one in the package. The display pocket is very sturdy and the removable fasteners make it a very useful item. Well made, strong, display pocket. It is a rigid, plastic display pocket for instant framing and mounting of single sheets of paper, photo's, etc. It is relatively easy to hang the display pocket on a wall. This display pocket came in handy. Using this display pocket is a great way to go. This display pocket was perfect for displaying my son's 'artwork' he brings home from school. This is a great display pocket for a business that needs to display an 8 1/2 by 11 page which might change often. It is clear enough to properly display photos, though. Now we have a handy, removable and replaceable display pocket that is clean and unobtrusive. You could take down the display and just leave the fasteners in place, but I don't like the way this looks.I'm a big fan of 3M removable fasteners. This display pocket from Scotch is a nice way to hang their artwork on the wall . For a more permanent display, this product is a very good option. It does tend to neaten the display area and keep edges from turning up, particularly when placed on the refrigerator. This is an easy to use plastic display pocket suitable for up to 8.5 by 11 photos or documents. When I saw this display pocket, I wondered if it would do the trick.It does.The pocket is a good, tight fit for an 8.5 x 11 inch sheet with a non-glare finish. Yes, it would be fine for mounting for display, but it's also excellent for making folds in the document disappear. The display product is a stiff, sturdy clear plastic. This is a sturdy clear display cover for certificates or small signs. Can't imagine an easier display. This plastic display pocket will also protect your document from scratch or water etc (unless the water is poured from the top where the opening is).
