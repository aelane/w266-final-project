This binder actually appears to be flimsy but it's quite sturdy. While not the flashiest this binder isn't ugly utilitarian.It's just a nice binder with a rubbery black band on the spine, good hand feel. It is hard to get excited about a binder. This binder is well made. I guess Avery is fixin' to find out, because they have built a better binder. This makes the binder more comfortable to hold and less likely to slip out of a person's hands. Most binder rings come together in a sort of a rough, interlocking way. Both of them are required to tote a white binder back and forth from school everyday. In this binder they store all types of important information: behavior, homework, upcoming assignments, and more. This binder is easy to grip and remove from a book shelf, unlike some others that are very slippery. I'll say it bluntly... a 3-ring binder is not something you want to cheap out on. They were (as far as I know), the first to use the D-ring binder for less stress on the pages, and now they are the first to make one with a binding that will not tear. I really like this binder. I highly recommend this binder for students and business workers alike. To be honest I've never really had a binder "fail" on me. I have been a big binder user ever since I was a boy and had several trusty Trapper Keepers for my classes. This binder has such a great design that it eliminates problems I often find with other binders such as edge corners that split, gapping rings or binders that don't lie flat and even.On this binder, the rubberized edge gives the binder extra strength as well as makes it easier to grip. This binder is one that will last a very long time even with heavy and frequent use.Definitely a 5-star product. The binder is well constructed. Front of binder has window for cover-sheet. This binder doesn't include such higher end features.It would have been nice to have a rubberized tab for opening. A very good functional binder at a reasonable price. This is a really great looking binder. Not this binder though. This is a sturdy and reasonably attractive binder. This binder works perfectly for those. So, I don't think you need to worry about buying binder sleeves that are made specifically for this binder - they all seem to fit perfectly. The binder I had, started tearing soonafter I loaded it up with his info. This one-inch binder has a reinforced spine covered with a black rubber for easy gripping. I never thought I'd be reviewing a binder, but seeing one turn up in Vine products intrigued me! What can you really say about a binder? For a binder, this Avery binder is quite attractive. When I open the binder, the sheets lay flat.The cover is large enough so it could fit sheet protectors and dividers. This is a great binder, very sturdy. I get frustrated when I come across a binder that doesn't have this feature, because I have to pull it out and open it to see what's inside. I really like the grippy reinforced binder(the dark section). The binder has a good feel and weight to it. This binder is definitely a good investment that can be used over and over again. But if you need a binder that will last longer than the usual stuff you get at staples or office max, you might want to invest in this Avery binder. This is a very contrasty and sharp looking black and white binder. Other than that, it's a typical 3 ring binder that does what it was designed to do. This new Avery Comfort touch binder is very nice.

A slightly advanced basic binder, the rubbery spine is a nice added touch that seems like it will increase the life of the spine, but unfortunately it is impossible to tell right now if that will be true  The rings are attached to the inside of the back cover, as is standard with most binders these days.

Because of this I simply cannot recommend this binder, especially given its price (currently $7.06 to $9.91).

This binder should serve most purposes: it has a cover pocket (but no reverse cover pocket), two interior pockets, a good grip, and the better ring orientation (fixed into the back cover rather than the spine).
