I've had this chair for months now and its held up great to daily use. I honestly do know understand how this chair could get a 4 start rating on average. The chair is properly shaped and does support your back, but it is too firm for my taste. This chair is well made and assembled easily. Ultimately it's a decently comforable chair. I love Amazon, but I am never ever buying a chair from them again. I got this chair on December 16 2013. No, it's not an expensive chair, but come on, two and a half months?Two words: Rip Off Overall a very comfy chair for a tall/large person. I have the Serta Multifunction Manager's Chair, the Serta Executive Chair, Alera Fraze Chair, and this chair. This chair smelled of horrible VOCs due to the processing of the fake leather. This chair is made for a specific body type, thin and tall. The chair has softened up a bit over the week and the smell has dissipated after I set a fan on it and opened all the windows. I haven't decided whether or not to return that chair. This chair is a Godsend!! I'm sitting on the chair right now and I'm so happy with this chair!!!! ASSEMBLY -  I love this chair. After returning a different chair because of missing parts and difficult assembly, I searched for a chair that is easily assembled by using "assembly" as a keyword search in reviews. However you can lock the chair in the 'upright position' to keep it from reclining. If you are looking for a chair that reclines or perhaps you enjoy sitting in a reclined position, this may not be for you. This is the  # 1 selling chair on Amazon and has been for two years, so it does satisfy thousands. The chair is clearly made of quality for a comparable priced chair. Unlike the previously returned chair, the box was clean, well strapped and unopened. Definitely not a returned chair. The chair has very low-density foam with extra for lumbar support (making it a little warm to sit in). Moreover, I'm finding this chair more comfortable than the more adjustable Staples one because the seat is attached lower to the back (both are better than similar priced chairs I've previously owned).One minute assembly for this chair also means it's easy to move (say from home to office and back again). The chair's tilt can also be locked (by pushing in rather than down on the height adjustment) - for better back support. The chair also does not lean quite far enough back to comfortably put your feet up on a desk. I gave this chair 5 stars at $142 (and would consider dropping it a star if over $150) but you would likely disagree if you're shorter (or like to lean back more). I got this chair as a gift for my wife and I.I got the new one and she got my old one.

Before I consider the chair itself please permit a few words about customer service and packing.Packing:  The chair arrived in a heavy duty box that had several gorillas handling it along the way.

It would delight me to revisit this chair 10 years from now explaining that the seat finally gave way or the mechanism just gave out from all the weight or whatever.

I am so glad we bought this chair and would do it again in a nanosecond.
