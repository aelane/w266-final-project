This pencil sharpener seems to work okay... just okay. As long as you put the pencil in straight and push in hard enough but not too hard... you'll get a sharpened pencil. I *really* wanted a pencil sharpener that didn't need to be plugged in, that the kids could use (they keep stealing my cosmetic pencil sharpener which is just a small little thing. This Minisharp portable pencil sharpener comes in one of those clamshell packs that is difficult to open(not sure why companies love to use these). Still, if you need a small, powered pencil sharpener to store in a desk drawer for occasional use, this would do the trick. This pencil sharpener is about as simple and basic as an electric powered sharpener could be, with nothing more than a small blade on the inside that looks much like a tiny, manually operated pencil sharpener. It turns when a pencil is inserted, but the problem is that it doesn't work very well at all. Not only does this pencil sharpener do a fine job of sharpening pencils it is also quite portable. I know that an electrical pencil sharpener is the way to go but I have limited space and refuse to give up on finding a battery operated one that actually works.I choose this one based on it's name only. I sharpen a pencil about once every two months. I had to firmly grasp the pencil to keep it from turning as it sharpened. QUICK SUMMARY:  If you're looking for a compact, battery-operated pencil sharpener, look elsewhere.Background:  When I got this pencil sharpener, the black plastic housing literally fell off the unit as I tried to open the battery compartment.
