It didn't take long at all before my black brush tip had all but lost the ability to make a fine line or point. The brush tips do not really get narrow enough for detail work, but neither do regular Sharpies. This is not a brush tip. I would expect a "brush" tip to be a brush, with actual bristles. But to call it a brush tip? The "brush" tip was fun, but not as versatile as I would have expected. While it is not truly a brush, the "brush tip" is really nice. With these Sharpie brush markers, you can control the width of your lines (thick or thin) by the amount of pressure you apply. The brush tip is got a very soft, slender tip, and its Sharpie quality ink, but something is missing. The brush tip is an interesting concept. Sharpie brush tips are made for Impressionism. lol  The brush tips are a little stiff at first, but flow so smoothly and are so true to color. If one is expecting a true "brush" tip, then one will be disappointed. The brush ends make these very different from traditional ones. With the brush tips, you can draw most anything! The brush tips make everything so nice. (These new brush tip markers are especially good for this, because you can control the thickness of the line with the pressure you use to write.) The brush effect is subtle; you don't have a ton of bristles sticking out of the pen body, merely that the tip is much more flexible than the usual fine tip Sharpie. Second, the brush tip is too soft so she is unable to precisely judge how much pressure to apply to distinguish between drawing thin lines and thicker lines.So, I would caution the artists of the world that these Sharpies might not be a perfect fit for those concerned with precision. In making the brush shape/capability for this Sharpie, it's like they gave up some structural integrity.Color/ink - the colors are very vibrant. I then used the brush stroke to fill in the big areas. I love the brush tip it worked really well for me. The brush is not as flexible as that in other brands, but I expect that means it will last longer without being completely smashed. The brush tip. And now these brush tip markers are even more fun.
