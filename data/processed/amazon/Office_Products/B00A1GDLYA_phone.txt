The VTech CareLine phone is being marketed for an older crowd, and that makes sense. If you're looking for a phone for your elderly parents, for example, this would be an excellent choice. The phone, in addition, was a snap to set up.As far as I can tell, then, there's nothing not to like about the CareLine. I highly recommend this phone. This phone is just awesome! The phone pendant is just wonderful. When the phone rings no more running to answer...the pendant takes care of that also...just answer from it. I love this phone and was thrilled that it was offered through the Amazon Vine Program. The phone seems to provide excellent volume suitable for those with some hearing loss. The phone features talking caller ID which is excellent. It took me awhile to review this phone because I wanted to see if it would work at our new house that is currently being renovated (we've been working on it a year in January) but there aren't any land lines laid in the ground there yet. My previous phone system was a Panasonic brand which I loved but it would cut out just outside the driveway here where this phone continues to work for a greater distance.....I would venture to say it's at least a half a city block (I'm estimating....I live in a rural area and we really don't have "blocks" here).My husband has worked around heavy, noisy equipment for most of his working life and so has some hearing loss and he thought this phone was even better than the Panasonic which was good but this one seems to have more clarity and the audio assist is great because it's almost too loud for me so I don't have to cringe when I answer the phone but my hubs can easily use it when he answers the phone so we are both happy with the volume. But the phone uses weird phone batteries. One is the portable phone. The phone has a little too much going on. However, this phone is not intended for people who have grown up with technology recent technology. There is a bit much here, perhaps enough to make the phone even a bit intimidating.However, the instructions are fairly clear, and many of the features need to be set up just once before they are set. This VTech phone system is unbelievable compared to the one we used to have. This phone system is not only a cordless phone, but a corded phone. The corded phone has a speaker phone. We are very happy with the new VTech phone system. This phone is clearly marketed to seniors but I can easily see this working well for someone with disabilities. It allows for the phone to always be found in the even that the cordless one get misplaced (which I can easily see one who is forgetful do). Good general phone and answering machine as well, easy to set up. This phone set comes with a regular push button phone with large buttons for anyone who is older and has trouble seeing can easily use. The main phone also has big short cut buttons that you can push and call a family member or anyone you want on speed dial.
