Basically the machine punches small holes along the margin of the page (25 pages at a time), you slide them onto the plastic comb and fasten it all together. You will have to do most of the figuring out of this machine on your own, the instructions are pretty bad. This is not necessary with the Galaxy Comb Binding machine. The machine will punch up to 500 pages at once, but I have not yet had that large of a document to bind.This is a great office supply gadget to have for teachers, or secretaries that have to bind a lot of documents that come through the office. This machine gets the job done. That said, the machine is mostly straightforward and I was able to figure it out.It punches cleanly and the papers line up easily to insert the comb, leaving the document looking quite professional. It is really an industrial sized machine that would get more use in an office than in my home - I'm not going to lie. Similarly, this machine has 'releasable dies' which avoid punching in positions 15, 20 and/or 21. The machine isn't heavily used, in that we use it maybe once every few weeks - but when you need to use it, you want it to work.The Fellowes works with absolutely no problems. The machine comes only with combs for smaller documents. This is a very sturdy machine and gives me the opinion that this will last for many many years. I would give this machine five stars, but unfortunately the instructions killed the last star.
