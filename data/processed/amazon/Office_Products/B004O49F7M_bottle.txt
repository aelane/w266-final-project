So it can be used multiple times.The bottle is oversized to make it easy to hold. It glued together nicely, and the bottle is better than other tubes of super glues I've used in the past. And as promised, the bottle opening does not clog between uses. Furthermore, when screwed onto the bottle, the cap assembly pierced the metal seal without the mess of the user having to do so with a punch. Invert the bottle, squeeze the front and back movable body panels of the bottle and the user can dispense the glue drop by drop like an eye-dropper. This bottle has an upright design, hard sides that you can hold without accidentally squeezing the product out when you're only trying to open the bottle. Since the bottle can sit upright, it can be stored sitting up waiting for the next application. Second, the little bottle can be put away for a long time and is still good for the next use.I think this innovative design will change the super glue market, once enough people become aware of the applicator method. I used this bottle for several little jobs around the house, and when I went back for it a month or two later, it was still flowing freely. The bottle seals tightly and the semi-rigid design means the excess glue can flow back into the bottle, keeping the applicator clear. I plan to check the bottle every few weeks for a few months and update this review as needed The bottle is much less messy, and less prone to dry out than the old fashion super glue metal tube. The bottle is simple enough to open, but it dispenses too slowly, and it's made of fairly rigid plastic. However, when I just now picked it up to give the bottle another glance, glue spilled all over a small portion of my fancy new dining room table and on my laptop. There is actually a bottle inside the bottle to help protect it from drying out, and make squeezing and applying easier. Opening the bottle initially takes a twist, and the cap should keep the remaining glue from drying out. The bottle is neat and it's easier to control the glue than a tube. The bottle is tall with curved sides to  squeeze just the number of drops you want. The bottle is small and easy to store; very convenient to reach in a drawer and pull it out at a moment's notice. I received my bottle of Scotch Super Glue Liquid with the precision applicator from the Amazon Vine program, free in exchange for writing a review of the product.I think every household has superglue, and probably all of those households have had to throw out those little metal tubes of superglue because the glue seals the dispenser tip shut. It dries fast and holds securely and permanently.The bottle is a big .14 oz. bottle, and you'll be able to squeeze out the last drop as easily as the first drop. I love that the bottle stands upright....no more fumbling with those awkward krazy glue tubes. I've since recommended this specific bottle of super glue to every one of my friend's and I needed to change my review to a more reflective one of my continued happiness with the container and product. However, the bottle top, or applicator, is a definite improvement. Will I finish the whole bottle before it glues itself shut forever? To begin with, even though it is a plastic bottle, it is sealed with what appears to be a foil membrane. The bottle is finally empty, but it never clogged, never dried out. Moreover, we are promised that the "Clog-resistant stay-fresh bottle avoids dry-out, so you can use the bottle over and over again. Just got out the bottle and used the glue to fix a little broken doohickey. The bottle worked perfectly - just like it was freshly opened.Update:  4 months later (December 29):  I am amazed that the bottle has not clogged nor dried out. I opened and used this bottle of superglue several times and found it to be just like regular superglue. The bottle shape is comfortable to handle and the precision tip applicator allows for good control over where the glue goes. I moved the bottle and my fingers stuck to it. Some of the bottle is still stuck to my counter, I am very upset over this, the bottle is not stable it may need a larger base so it will not topple over so easily.
