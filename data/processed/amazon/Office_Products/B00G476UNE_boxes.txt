The boxes are made by Fellows which is a top notch brand and they are sturdy and made out of a thick cardboard and can hold a good amount of weight. The boxes are quite large and just a great size for storing anything, not just papers.The boxes will last a long time no doubt, and with the quality of the cardboard, you can pack them pretty heavy without worries of damage to the box.Highly recommended! The boxes were easy to assemble -- I just guessed and they popped together. These boxes work very well. Other than that very similar to the boxes I have been using. I have found that with most of these boxes, the lid tends to be difficult to bend and fit into place and stay. I use these boxes to put away my many, many holiday decorations. First off, these boxes are a bit longer than most banker boxes. Very strong, easy to store and assemble boxes for important documents and heavier books. Just be aware that these boxes are packed in another box nearly 3 feet long. I'll use these, so for me it's &#34;Whoo-hoo, six boxes for the price of four!&#34;, but it did seem rather extreme. If not, go for the smaller letter/legal-sized boxes.

When I saw these boxes, marketed as legal sized, I assumed they'd be just enough wider than the regular letter sized boxes to accommodate 14-inch long files instead of 11-inch long ones.

Instead, they're fully twice as large as the regular sized boxes, simply too large to be filled solid with paper and still be portable.I'm not able to use these boxes as I'd originally intended, but they're still fantastic, so I've got them storing clothes instead of files.

These boxes arrived at the perfect time - the end of the year when you need storage for your paper files.
