The Uni-ball Vision Elite are probably my favorite store-bought pens ever. If you like your pens with caps and also like smooth writing and multiple colors, these pens are for you. These pens are so smooth to write with and I have never had one skip. I enjoy using the Uni-ball pens to sign certificates. The Uni-ball pens last a long time for me, but when these run out, I will be buying more. I love writing with these pens. These pens are silky-smooth rollerballs that glide nicely across the paper, making them easier to write with than cheap ballpoints. )These pens are not inexpensive, but I find I don't lose them because I'm always using them. I have broken many pens as well as throwing them in the trash when they don't write when I need them to. I also hate pens that do not write smoothly and I have to grind the pen on the paper to get the ink to come out and that vibration that results from the grinding is an unpleasant feeling.Because I don't write often enough to spend more for better quality pens, I just end up dealing with the bad quality pens that cross my path. The pens themselves are attractive looking and on the surface appear to be better quality than the cheap pens. For the latter I am satisfied; the pens are very comfortable to hold and there is no discomfort in my fingers or hand while writing with these pens. While not as bad as some pens I have used there is still a slight vibration and I feel like I still have to "grind" the pen slightly when writing to get the control I would like so I still feel the vibration a little bit. After using these pens for about a week now, I would have to say they are not something I would personally buy in the future. Why can't all pens be made like this one. I normally use the Uniball 207 Signo pens which glide effortlessly across the paper and makes periods of long writing a breeze. Too bad we can't combine the two pens and make one great one. I love these pens. All their pens are fantastic. These are smooth writing pens and I love the muted colors. I didn't realize these were colored pens!" I have not been able to test the pens in an airplane, because I do not fly, but they are not supposed to expand and leak under cabin pressure or high altitudes. I really like these pens. I don't do gel pens much, but this trial run became an add-on to my writing inventory.The Uni-ball Vision Elite fits well in the hand, writes well without fading or streaking as some gel pens have the habit of doing, and this particular grouping comes in several different colors. Are these pens supposed to write in different colors -- or at least with a slight tint to the inks? These Uni-ball Vision Elite pens are lovely. I've always liked Uni-ball pens because of the ink and the way it glides onto the paper. I like these pens. Colored pens usually make me think "teenage girl", but these colors are darker, more grown up fun. Those pens were/are very bright colors, so I was curious about this new set that adds black ink to the colors. These are very comfortable pens to write with, but what I like most is the colors of the ink. These pens feel good and write well. These are attractive pens with a clear section near the tip (to see the ink levels) that has something like a basket weave pattern on it. I prefer pens with rubberized grips.The Color at either end really doesn't match the color of the ink inside. They're just pens. The pens come in blue/black, brown/black, green/black, purple/black, and red black. Until these pens, it would have never occurred to me to use anything but black or blue ink to write a check. These pens are not appropriate for any kind of shiny, coated surfaces (like Valentines or gift tags for Christmas!) Great pens! The pens I find I like using the most these days are by Pilot Precise V5 extra fine. I used these in the past & didn't like them as much as Uni-ball pens. These Rollerball pens are quite unique. Love my Uni-ball Vision Elite BLX pens. These five pens, due to Uniball's  BLX technology where black is infused with the colors offer a rich ink flow that is ideal for professional use. The pens are made in  Japan so they can be expected to have a useful life while there is  ink remaining. I've love pens and pencils and have enjoyed Uni-ball products for many years and this new roller ball pen with the black-based color inks is terrific. These pens are fantastic. Love these pens! These are very good pens. Uni-ball pens have been my favorite pens for over 5 years. She uses pens for all kinds of writing: from bills, personal notes, finance guidelines, recipes, phone messages, post-it notes, ect., ect. I thought these pens were rather neat; neat in looks, with neat and different colors. Super Ink?I know gel pens are a little more expensive, but at $3/pen ($15/pack), you may want to check out cheaper alternatives. Nothing remarkable to report here, either good or bad, but you can easily buy similar pens for a far cheaper price.Update: These pens have a nasty habit of leaking ink onto my hands, and smearing on paper. I've now had these pens for awhile and they are terrible. I write very fast and most pens don't keep up well or are scratchy in one way or another but these Uni-Ball Elite kept up nicely even well I was writing as fast as I could and the results were excellent, better than any other inexpensive pens. I love writing with these pens -- they're very smooth, and the colors are rich yet legible because of the black undertone. With these pens the color and performance is consistent with no bleeding or smudging.The inks don't explode because of changed pressure on an airplane. After the pens were tested, I was carefull to make sure the pens were returned to me.Like pens? Particular about your pens? And of the five pens, the blue one (which I'd likely use the most often) didn't even write.I know Uni-Ball is known for its performance and reliability, and perhaps I received a bad set, but the inconsistency I experienced with these pens would not make me recommend this specific style. I haven't yet tested one of these pens on an airplane flight, but I expect them to work fine. These pens work fine, but I am disappointed with the colors. These are BLX pens, meaning they use black infused colored ink. I am pretty sure these will be my "thank you note" pens for Christmas. Nice pens. Uni-ball pens have a wide, but not too wide point. But fortunately, these Uni-ball pens can be refilled - and one cartridge is long-lasting. Not so, however, with these pens, which dry quickly and do not smear.Skeptical that they are really waterproof, I just dunked an entire page of writing I had done in a sink full of water and let it soak. When I think of colored pens, I tend to think of something children might want for fun. And some pens can poke through the paper when used in the left hand. What sets these apart from other Uni-ball pens is the ink. These pens are very comfortable to use in general, and perform very well on all types of paper and even some non-paper surfaces.

In general, I like these pens, but I have found that they are not totally without issues.

I love these pens!First, they are very comfortable.

These pens weren't any better or any worse than the dozens of others I already have in the pen caddy on my desk.
