So, I use these for items like clothing, books, toys, pots. If you try to pack them full of items that are too heavy, there is a good chance you will not be able to lift using the built in handles without causing strain on the hands. However, for boxing up light items, I think they'd be very useful. However there are some items you simply don't want to risk in those cheap boxes. They are also handy for moving as they are sturdy enough for heavier items such as books, cds, etc.I like the one piece design so there is no lid to fall off or lose while you are depleting your supply. Just put your items in and fold the box up. But once you've started placing items it's no longer an issue.I plan on buying more of these boxes, and the large size too, for our next move. and I have literally removed items from the plastic bins and transferred to these as they are very sturdy and strong. For more reasonable items, they are fine, and have reinforced handle cutouts. Even with heavy items, there was no ripping, sagging, or the like. As long as you're not lugging ridiculously heavy items, you can safely carry these by the amazing tape-less handles without worry of it collapsing. So basically you can only use them for moving, but not stacking them, so unless you are just bringing light items, like a few boxes in the back seat of your car, they are a bit useless.I will give them 3 stars for the design.

What I do is packing heavy and light items in the same box.

They are extremely sturdy, even when the items inside are heavy books.

and more unopened items purchased from Amazon that I'd like to admit to.
