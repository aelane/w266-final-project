This product does sharpen pencils, but not as good as a higher priced sharpener. The product is pretty cute on the desk and the design is perfect for space saving. This would be an ok product if you don't have much desk space. This product is meant to replace my old (20+ years) Panasonic electric sharpener that still works but is becoming a bit tempermental.First, the asthetics. Always be suspicious when a product that serves one specific function is touted for its "prettiness"... when aesthetics have no bearing on its function.Getting down to it:  This lightweight, electric pencil sharpener simply refuses to put an even point on a pencil.No matter how I position the pencil inside this gizmo, the lead is always exposed off-center.Sometimes, so off-center that the wood gets sharpened to a point, blocking the lead. This is a good looking product and it takes up a minimum of desk space. This is Model 14875-14877 ("designed in the USA/made in China"), a fine product of Westcott ("Since 1872"), which is a brand of the ACME United Corporation. This product does not weigh a lot. But for a product like this, it's not. So unfortunately, using this product is a two-hands operation.The packaging touts the "auto sensor shut off." Be careful.The product pamphlet notes in bold that this product is "not intended for use on fine surfaces." The product comes with a standard 1-year warranty. The product photo doesn't show the electrical cord that you plug in - no batteries.
