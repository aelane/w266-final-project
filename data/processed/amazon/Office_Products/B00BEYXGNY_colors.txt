So these neon colors give me some variety for my future labeling.Highly recommended. The colors of these markers are similar to bright highlighters, except you can write with them and they are easier to read. I love the colors in this set. I was disappointed that the colors were very light to dull under regular room light. The colors are so bright and vivid I can't believe they are Sharpies! The clearest colors to read in a well lit room seem to be blue, pink and orange but the yellow does stand out well when you read in the dark.I've been using these Neon Sharpies for organizing notes for my accounts, for writing, and for projects. They are brighter than usual colors but come to life more under Black Light. Some colors were better than others in both light and black light conditions. So far these neon colors have been useful only on white backgrounds--but they really are bright on white. If you want bright permanent colors on white or very light colored backgrounds (like white paper), then these are the pens for you. The colors are brilliant and exhibit smooth coverage on professional 100% rag marker paper, as well as on regular white copy paper. (Please note - They don't streak, but colors may seep through to the back.) The colors are smooth and acurate and I had no problem with odor or smearing. I use them when I design landscaping and run Role Playing Games as the different colors allow me to better identify aspects of my maps and designs. She likes the colors - bright and fun - but doesn't like the fact that the colors only show up on white. She says the colors are very close to other Sharpie colors she has but those don't glow under a blacklight. So if you just need the colors - but not the blacklight option - there are probably better Sharpie options. These colors are neon. They're basically exactly the colors you would expect from highlighters--so true neon here. If you want truly bright colors that will work on any color I'd suggest going with regular Sharpies. These neon colors caught my eye and I wanted to try them.Don't be fooled, these are not highlighters. The colors, while neon, are a bit darker on paper than your average highlighter. Cool colors for sure, but not sure what I am going to do with them now. The colors are very vibrant on their own and, like other fine tip Sharpies, they write eaily and clearly. The colors are clear, bright and permanent, though luminous colors like these tend to fade very quickly. I have Sharpie's in all colors and point sizes. The brightest two colors in this set are the blue and orange. They just have the best colors and look great! The colors are fun and bright and clear.
