This table is sturdy and attractive for a folding table. The table impressed us so much that we ended up buying three more before all was said and done, and we use them for everything: as desks, as a kitchen table, and as all-purpose workspaces. I'm about 5'11" and this table works well for me. This table is pretty much exactly as shown and described here. This is a solid table and well-made. I bought this table for using in the backyard when we have friends come over for a BBQ or something. I already had one of these table so when the need arose again of needing a table I purchased another one. The folded table is less than 2" thick and can be stored under a couch as another reviewer noted. This table is of sturdy construction, but it is quite light and easy to carry around. It's a really solid, stable, spacious table. Also, this table is very strong. This is a very nice table. I would definitely recommend this table to anyone for practically anything you would need it for. This table is lightweight and sturdy enough to suit my needs for a table that I can easily move around on my own and to use for different purposes.
