What can I say...these are black markers, not as fine as I wished for, but fairly non-toxic compared to some. These markers do a great job. These markers (I wouldn't use the term "pens" for various reasons) are definitely permanent. These are the classic markers and at a decent price (wish I shopped costco first, unfortunately). Exactly what you'd expect if you're ordering these markers. These markers will mark on painted surfaces, steel, aluminum, copper, etc. Read on...I've heard that some permanent markers have solvents in their ink that can damage the top coating on CD or DVD disks. These are good markers.

I use these Sharpie markers to color in the alopecia areata spots on my brunette head.

The Sharpie markers are doing its permanent marking job very successfully but what is more important you can use them on all sorts of materials - on paper, CD, DVD, most plastics, metal, wood, cardboard...The markers are comfortable to grip, sliding is easy, they contain a lot of ink, color is vibrant and sharp, and it dries fast.What could make the difference about its durability is that they can last longer if you regularly put the cap back every time you finished using them.Due to their versatility and good pricing I could recommend these black markers as well as color ones for your office or home usage.You'll get twelve of them in package which means for a long time you will be able to be carefree.
