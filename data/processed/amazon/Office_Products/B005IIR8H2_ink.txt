It also seems to be very economical with ink. The ink cartridges are high capacity and very easy to install (no messy ink on the exterior of the cartridges to deal with). I don't know if it uses less ink than other printers in this class; honestly I'm not sure how you would know. Loading the 4 provided ink cartridges is easy, line them up at the color slot with the word Epson up and push them in until they click. The ink cartridges are long-lasting - though not as long as a laser cartridge - and the machine's settings are easily read and used. At first I thought I had to buy the ink to fill the cartridges, but no, you just give each cartridge a 5 second shake and insert them into the printer. Epson realizes that small ink tanks with low capacity are a major anger-point for printer consumers, and so these tanks last a while. As with any other Epson I've owned so far, with normal use the ink cartridge lasts a long time, and that is a big deal for me. While I haven't run out of ink yet on my initial cartridges (which have a lower yield than ones you'll buy as replacements), this claim appears accurate based on what I've printed to date and how much ink still remains in my cartridges. I only use ink from the printer's manufacturer rather than refills by other firms, so your mileage may vary.

Time will tell if the ink usage is better than that of most other inkjet printers I have used but if Epson's claims are true and it can average 1000+ pages color and 2000+ pages black-and-white, then this very well may be the printer to consider instead of a color laser printer.

This gets the ink flowing, etc.

So draft only saves ink, not time.7) No borderless photos.
