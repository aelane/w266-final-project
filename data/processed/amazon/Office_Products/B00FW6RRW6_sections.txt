The sections are things to do, things to remember and things to buy. If you want you can use  (I do) the 3 sections:TO DOTO REMEMBERTO BUYor ignore them.The magnets at the top and bottom keeps the notepad in place where you want it. Since you (obviously) can't tear off one of the upper 2 sections without taking the one beneath it, the elastic does come in handy since it can still hold those sections without just wasting them and throwing them away. It has three sections: To Do, To Remember and a To Buy section which some people may find useful with five lines underneath each section. Comprised of three perforated sections in each sheet, I'd recommend ignoring the To Do..., To Remember..., and To Buy... headings and writing your notes starting at the bottom of each page, so that you can tear off each third of the sheet as you've filled it or need to reference the information. I like the three different sections (to do, to remember, and to buy) but the perforations are on the bottom of each section. The perforated sections of each sheet are nice if you want to take off only one section. The 3 sections (To do&#8230;, To Remember&#8230; and To Buy&#8230;) don&#8217;t always work with what we use the notepad for. The sections do not correspond to my use. Depending on which of the top 2 sections you're needing, you're either going to have to tear off the bottom 2 sections or the whole sheet with all 3 sections to get the sections that you are truly wanting to tear off. Each of these 3 sections has only 4 lines to actually write on (even though the pictures show 5 lines per section) although you can squeeze smaller writing underneath of the bottom line to get an extra row but it's pretty tight, especially for the To Buy section.

It's got sections for &#34;To Do,&#34; &#34;To Remember,&#34; and &#34;To Buy.&#34;  The sections are smooth perforated, so you can tear off just part of the sheet (a problem if the TOP is the part you want!)

These sections are perforated so you and tear them off and only carry what you want.

It is neat that the three sections are perforated, so you can split your larger list into smaller lists if needed.
