I like that they are perforated so you can use them as a sticky note of just take the note with you. Can carry around the note for inspriation.One warning - don't get caught in the rain or put down on a wet sink -- the colors run I'm a big sticky note fan and I like longer ones that can keep a shopping or to do list. Occasionally I'd remove a note and the perforation (with the tacky portion) would rip and I'd be left with a note but no way to stick it.Pros:  Big, ruledCons:  Too bright, frustrating perforation I can easily write out what I need and stick the note to my cork board or fridge to add to when needed. I love having little note pads in various spots around the house. The sticky note part is great for leaving a note on a counter without the worry it would blow away under a table or something and be missed.Overall, an excellent product that serves it's purpose well. I've had the following note stuck in my car for three weeks in the dry, summer heat: "Don't forget the dog's water bottle." Usually I would just write the note or list and then tear it off, as one would with a small notebook. Or I would stick the note to something without the thought of "I wish I could tear this note off from the sticky edge later". Nice!Overall I highly recommend these note pages. Who  can't appreciate a 4x6, lined, neon colored post-it note? This sticky note is a new twist on an old favorite. You can tear the note off from the sticky part. It is so convenient to just tear off the sticky note when finished without the sticky back still attached. If you want to peel off the entire note, it is no problem (the perforated part is tough enough, it doesn't start to tear on you). A note about the orange. Overall, a good sticky note option for all of the notetakers and list makers out there. It's just a great note pad for sticking or not sticking with more room for writing messages or lists on the lines. What do you do when you write a note and then have to take with you? If you are like me, you have a note in your pocket with the sticky section picking up lint and everything else. Either that or you have your note folded in half to cover the adhesive. That or every note in my pocket is folded in half. With Avery Perforated Sticky Notes, I can write a note and then take it and go - no fuss and more importantly, no muss.
