It was simple to get the printer online and connected to our wireless network. The printer itself is high quality, and her only complaint is that it's not two-sided. Our Brother Laser printer started leaving smudges on the paper, and I wanted a reliable back-up that didn't cost a fortune. "This HP printer is not an ultimate printer, but it's not priced as one, either. When you first set up the printer, it prints an automatic alignment page to ensure high quality printing. For occasional printer use at home, I would choose a different printer that is more economical. This printer really made me struggle to set it up. We don't print on it often, but I can see that if we did it would go through printer cartridges pretty quickly. I think you needed a regular printer for everyday use, perhaps this product wouldn't be right for you. I needed a new printer and have previously had better luck with HP than others. I hate it when a printer quits working just because it is out of colored ink. This printer is not that useful to me because I need to print a lot and do not want the expense of replacing cartridges so often. I got this printer for free to review, so the price was right! I installed the printer from the CD, to try to avoid a lot of extra waiting. This printer installation, also UNINSTALLED my other HP printer, which I still use since it is a WIDE FORMAT one! I wish I could say more about this printer, but really it's an adequate printer if you don't plan to print much. I still have not figured out how to email the printer a document to print.

This printer, while good, is not versatile and the support for it is pretty underwhelming.The 6100e ("e" is for wireless) office jet is one of the dwindling number of basic printers from HP as they migrate from "printers" to "all in ones" and lasers that also include scanning and faxing to the routine.

This printer is the first from HP that uses the two cartridge system that has been around forever, and instead moves to the FOUR cartridge system.

But had I known now what I know about this printer, I never would have bought it.
