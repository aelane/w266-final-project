Some mouse pads these days do come witha cushion for the wrist. However, this one allows the mouse pad to tiltupwards or downwards. It will not bend or fold while moving the mouse along the surface. And importantly, because the mouse pad is composed of such sturdy plastic, it remains solid even with the elevation pegs attached.Fifth, did you know? If your mouse pad wrist pad is not composed of antimicrobial materials, you're likely a good candidate for the next major workplace virus known to lurk on mice of many forms. The mouse pad itself is rigid and fairly heavy for a mouse pad, but there are times, particularly with a laptop when working somewhere other than at a desk, this might be a plus if you don't like using the touch-pad (which I don't). The mouse does move smoothly across the pad without catching.I really can't say how I would feel about this mouse if I didn't have the wrist problem. )Overall, the mouse pad works well. I used it with an optical and non-optical mouse and it worked well with both. This is a very comfortable mouse pad that combines a hard surface for the mouse and a soft one for your wrist. This mouse pad is not for me. The mouse pad itself has some nice non-slip strips on the back to make it stable on the desk--the problem is that once you put on the risers to give it a little bit of a lift on one end or the other, the non-slip strips are no longer in contact with the desktop and the mouse pad slips and slides all over the place. With all of the mouse work that I do for film editing, it's nice to have something that is not only a great surface for my mouse but has comfort and looks like it will be around for a very long time. However, eventually I will have to change to a mouse again, so I decided to give this pad a run with my wireless mouse.The gel pad and tilting of the pad in a forward direction help me a lot with being able to use the mouse more comfortably. This is a great mouse pad--comfortable and conveniently portable. Also the antimicrobial mouse pad is just the right texture for an optical mouse. This adjustable mouse pad with the gel pad for the wrist is a relief. Using an optical mouse, I have had difficulty with most mousepads in making tiny mouse movements, which is a skill you need to be able to employ in Photoshop, straining both eye and wrist to manipulate selections of individual pixels. The mouse area has a distinctive surface for precise laser mouse control.This pad is excellent for gamers as well. My mouse gets the perfect traction (not too much, not too little) from the mouse pad and both ball and laser mice seem more accurate on this pad than on my previous cheap plastic mouse pad. Overall this is a great mouse pad though it's slightly smaller (when it comes to its width) than what I personally prefer. What I like the most about this mouse are the attachable feet that can significantly raise its height. This mouse raises well above that edge to support my wrist.I still think that the gel wrist support could be improved to make it more comfortable. 3M Tilt-Adjustable Mouse Pad and Gel Wrist Pad, Antimicrobial Product Protection (WR421LE)This is the first mouse pad I've ever used that can be tilted. It is the best mouse pads I've ever used. I have ended up continuing to use my old low-tech mouse pad but I did unattached the wristrest which is now resting at the bottom of the mouse pad and it works really well. My mouse pad arrived in perfect condition. This mouse pad comes in several pieces which have to be stuck on before you use it. I will say that the mouse surface seems to be more precise and rolls quickly and with ease. If you don't have an optical mouse, but the roller-ball style, this mouse pad is great. Since we started using the mouse pad, that has stopped. I have tried with several mouse types and all respond their best on this pad.This thing is durable, stable and will definitely last a long time. This one sticks to the mouse pad base with a double sided adhesive that comes in the box. This mouse pad is a solid, very hard surface on the bottom, and a wrist rest that is a bit more firm than I like: I have a gel wrist wrest that I much prefer, but what I do absolutely love about this mousing surface, is that even though it is a bit heavy to carry around, it's the perfect hard surface to use on the coach with a laptop on wireless! Overall I think it's a fairly nice mouse pad. I use a Logitech mouse which gets really good battery life so it goes a long time between charges. But I think I may be recharging the mouse less often. THe mouse glides across it smoothly and it even works well with the old ball type mice (I have one that I don't use but had to test.) The mouse pad itself is very sturdy. The mouse pad is tilt adjustable with a variety of settings. This will hold it steady and also give the mouse a comfortable angle which is easy on your wrists. The 3M mouse pad has a lot of new features that I've not seen before.For one thing it tilts and depending on the size of the legs you add on you can control how much. This mouse pad with wrist pad works just fine, though is fairly expensive. This is the first mouse pad I have ever had to assemble! The mouse pad itself is a rigid platform with a finely-ribbed surface on the top for the mouse to slide over and a smooth bottom section on which you attach the wrist rest. The mouse pad is very high quality amd made perfectly for the most part. This mouse pad has been wonderful. It never occurred to me to even think about getting a mouse pad with a tilt to it. I also tried using the mouse pad laying flat on my desk. The mouse feels like it's gliding across the surface.It is a bit pricey but, when you add the comfort factor it's worth it. I had to switch which mouse I used with this pad because the wireless one I was using was a bit heavy and would constantly slide as soon as I let go of it - and with Windows 7 that would result in the selected window changing, which is pretty annoying. But once I switched back to a normal mouse that problem stopped.Overall, it's a good mouse pad if you're thinking about your wrist but not ideal for all mouse types.I
