You can peel them off one page and move to another multiple times without (to my experience) lifting any ink or leaving behind any adhesive residue.Why 4 stars instead of 5? Obviously if you mark nearly every page in a book, these can turn out to be quite expensive. It didn't tear the page when I removed it after twenty-four hours and it didn't take off the ink. But unfortunately, you find yourself frustrated that you lost that page?Well, if you're looking for note tabs, Avery NoteTabs are definitely worth considering. I prefer the Avery Tabs used to mark page locations; also with a write on surface.Since I was a bit indifferent about the product, I gave a few to family members to try. You can put the NoteTab on a page and write notes on it over top of what you're reading. )Being wide and sticky, you want to roll them down onto the page to avoid a pinched page that will wrinkle when the book is closed.A big flaw with these is that the blank tab surface is only writable on one side of the tab. I'll mark the page with the tabbed section, writing a brief note about my question, and then tear of one (or more) of the perforations at the bottom to mark the exact passage I don't understand.Avery NoteTabs stay put until I want to remove them, and then they can be removed as easily as s Post-It. They are very secure, without permanently marring the page to which they are attached. Tabs stick out beyond the page, while still maintaining a tidy appearance. With this, I can simply tag the page and keep flipping the pages and come back to the page I wanted to remember. I can stick the whole Notetab on a page and just leave it there. As well as clearly marking a page, and removing from even delicate books without damage (yet not falling out of the pages unplanned) they provide plentiful writing space!The item is transparent, so you can read the content below it.
