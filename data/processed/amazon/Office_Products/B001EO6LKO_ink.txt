I was amazed at how quickly the ink kept running out. Epson doesn't sell the black ink packaged with the colored inks. The ink installs easily (just peel off the sticker on the back and click it in). I've used generic ink before with my HP inkjet printer without a problem, but the Epson is finicky. And who would have thought a $15 ink cartridge would turn into a rambling, political statement. This ink is excellent in quality, and the price is only a few percent above re-manufactured cartridge prices when you consider amount of ink actually available for use. Well, I don't know what to say about this ink except that it met my expectations. Mine appears to be genuine Epson ink in every way at a nice discount and without having to drive to the store.Also, I'm very happy with my Artisan 835 printer. I use this ink with my Artisan 837 printer and I like the quality of print while using it. The &#34;proprietary ink cart&#34; scam has been going on for years now. The ink lasts... the printer prints well... it does what it says on the box - and so all should be good.But I wish epson would bundle the 98 black with the 5-pack color multipack and not force me to shell out so much separately for a single black cartridge.
