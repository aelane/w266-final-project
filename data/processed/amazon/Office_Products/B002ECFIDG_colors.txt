The 3 different colors allow basic categorizing. The colors in this packet are very bright, and easily adaptable to a color-coded system for labeling office products.These removable labels have glue all over the back of them, rather than just at the top. I hope they make them in some additional colors. The colors work well for me especially when I have a plan or project that calls for single colors and other colors. The colors are nice as well. The colors are distinct but light enough to easily write on. All three colors are stuck to the same cardboard backer, making the whole pad easy to carry around.Overall, very nice. The colors are pleasant and neutral, even though I would've preferred a soft orange or red hue, as opposed to the avocado colored labels at the top of the "pad". The three colors allow you organize things by color.~Recyclable - You just have to love that label and save the earth all at the same time.~Tab - Each label has a tab attached that makes it easier to pull off one tab at a tab and save your fingernails.The Cons:~Cost - These are a little expensive for 120 labels.Don't be afraid to think outside the box with these labels! They come in three colors all on one solid backing so they all stay together. I like that there are three colors so each child can be assigned a specific color. The bright colors help to organize for quickly identifying subjects. The three colors (particularly the blue and green) are compatible and complimentary with so many scrapbook designs that I wish Avery would extend the possible uses by making them acid free and adding more colors. The outlined colors contain an area for writing that is 3/4 inch by 2 3/4 inch- not much writing room.
