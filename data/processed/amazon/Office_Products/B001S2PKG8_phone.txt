This is a great phone for the money. My old phone that finally took a notion to die was so old it still had one of those big long antennas on it. I was looking for a basic phone and nothing extra. The phone is very easy to set up and use. Otherwise, this phone set is great! I am using them with the Magic Jack Plus phone service. This phone do not interfere or interfered with our Wifi signals. As we have voicemail included with our phone service, when we were looking for a new phone system we decided to skip those with digital answering devices. Redial and digit by digit correcting a miskeyed phone number are also nice. That's how good the phone has turned out to be. Other than that the phone is great and I gave it five stars because it deserves it. That phone was quite basic, without any phone book or speaker phone features and I'm not even sure it that system even included any sort of 'find handset' paging feature. While that phone was apparently targeted towards teens, it's feature set made it useful for adults as well. I should note that it's not all that easy to find an Expandable Cordless phone system that doesn't include an answering system and I wish the manufacturers wouldn't force customers to pay for such features when they aren't needed.Once past that issue, the list of requirements was fairly small: inexpensive (hey, I try to watch the budget! If the phone featured unique ring tones (assignable to any given phone number that calls in), it would be a bonus, but it wasn't a requirement given the importance of keeping the costs reasonable.TheVtech DECT 6.0 White/Black Expandable 2-Handset Cordless Phone System with Caller ID and Handset Speakerphone (CS6219-2)system meets those requirements, but as noted in the subject line for this review, these phones are really basic. The phone he use to have would often cut out during our conversations. He has been using these phone now doe three months. I'm sure it's not the best phone there can be, but I was pleasantly surprised at how close it comes to being just what I wanted at a very good price.
