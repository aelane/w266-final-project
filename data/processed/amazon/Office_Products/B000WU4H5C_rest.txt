I would be happier now with a shorter rest, I pushed this one to the left to stay out of the way of my mouse. The rest is comfortable, offering a slight yield (it's fairly firm) and plenty of support. It also is to help prevent the rest from degrading.The underside of the rest is smooth, but is made of a rubber that prevents the rest from sliding around on the desk or keyboard tray.I also use this with my large 19 inch laptop (not just my desktop computer). The rest is about 19" long, so it spans the typical keyboard, and leaves room to the side for a mouse, etc. The wrist rest does not slide around a bit. This rest elevates my hands to the proper level, and my hands didn't hurt at all after a long day at my computer. The rest is firmer than I anticipated, but it's really just the right firmness--I wouldn't want the weight of my hands to cause them to sink into the rest, which would defeat the purpose of having one!The rest comes with a thin plastic membrane covering the underside. The rest does adhere to my desk, but it easily peels up and sticks back down again, so you don't have to worry about it moving around while you use it, but you can also move it from computer to computer if desired.The only downside to this product is that, due to its curved construction, my left wrist didn't have the same width of padding as my right wrist did. This can be easily remedied by moving the rest off center, which I did, but doing so doesn't look as "clean" as when the rest is centered below the keyboard. If you care about how the rest looks by your keyboard, you may want to find another product. The rest that I use on my keyboard has a cloth cover that over time has become worn and dirty and it is hard, if not impossible to clean. At first, I was disappointed with this rest because 1. it was so firm that that I didn't think it would be comfortable hours into the day and 2. There simply isn't enough rest for the wrists. That's a wrist rest. I've never used a wrist rest before since I never thought one would make much difference, but after using this for a week, I'm not sure how I managed so long without it. I have not used a wrist rest for several years because my last one was foam based and with a cloth cover and not only did it get icky grimy (though I could wash the cover), I now realize that it wasn't actually supportive enough. If you need a rest (due to symptoms of carpal tunnel) you should purchase this to assist in keeping your wrists elevated and cushioned. I've never used a wrist rest before and have now been using this for over a month. I received this wrist rest via the Amazon Vine program and this is one very nice, comfortable item. The rest's padding is fairly hard, with just a little bit of give. This rest is completely different from the other rest in every way possible. This rest is comfortable, easy to clean, and certainly long enough for a keyboard, although the keyboard we're using it for is too long to allow it to also provide wrist support for the mouse. The rest may not be as long as desired, since you might tell from the picture that it barely covers the length of the mouse pad, but it does the job fine. This is a soft rest for your wrists as you use the mouse and keyboard.Compared to other similar gel rests this one is nice quality with a non slip bottom.The cushion is moderately firm. Now I don't have to worry about a stained or stinking wrist rest from having coffee or soda spilled on it. This one does seem a little higher priced than the rest. The rest comes with a film across the bottom surface. A simple yet effective rest for mouse use that works well. If you need a wrist rest this is an excellent choice. I posted a user-photo on Amazon that shows the rest sitting next to my gateway keyboard and it fits perfectly for me. This rest claims to be anti-bacterial; there's no way I can prove or disprove that fact. The rest, I had before this, was a gel, it started leaking and luckily  I spotted it before it got into my keyboard. It would also be suitable for those who want a firmer rest than most others.T
