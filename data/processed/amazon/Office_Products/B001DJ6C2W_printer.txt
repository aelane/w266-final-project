I have had this printer for 2 years and I think it is very unpredictable. This printer does not communicate. Gosh, I hate this printer. The Canon PIXMA MP980 Wireless Photo All- In- One Printer is a very nice printer that eliminates cords and helps keep work spaces neater and cleaner. This printer utilizes wireless technology and this means you have greater flexibility as to the location of the printer in your home. This printer is acceptable in the speed department, but a little slower than with other photo printers I have used and it doesn't measure up to the claims by the manufacturer. When you install this printer, it will ask you to select either wireless or wired for the network. Also, this printer doesn't offer fax. Like having one printer for all of the computers, especially the laptops that previously weren't hooked up to printers. I use the printer on a wireless network and the printing is agonizingly slow. The printer also drinks ink at a tremendous rate, and when the gray runs out, it has to be ordered on the Internet because stores do not carry it! You can follow the manual to set the printer directly for wired or wireless under settings menu but don't waste your time going any further then this with setup on the printer itself. I plugged the printer into my wireless router and unplugged the USB as directed with perfect results.
