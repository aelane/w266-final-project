This is a very specialized product, which will be quite useful for some people and unnecessary for most. I have rated the product with  three stars because it may very well serve the purpose of some users but not serve the purpose of others. They are not expensive, so if you think this product might suit your purposes, buy 1 package and try it out. Definately a product worth sharing - a small price for something simple that made an elderly woman happy. I am used to using now another new product of theirs, the 1" x 3" removable label pads. Nice little product. This is a great product that does just what it's supposed to do. This product has become indispensible to me. Teh NoteTabs are a handy product. I give the product four stars, one star removed because of the exorbitant price.You receive two sets of long tabs, numbered 1 to 10. The product holds well and I like that I can reuse them. The product consists of two sets of ten tabs. The product enables easy bookmarking of corporate presentations or school reports, where the presentation has up to ten sections. First off, this is a very specific product.
