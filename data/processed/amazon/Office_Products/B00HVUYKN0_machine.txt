The machine itself is actually kind of big, so it will take up a bit of space.The one thing that is a bit of a bummer on the Fellowes system here is that their pouches are actually kind of expensive. The machine heats up in around 30 seconds and off you go! With that said this machine was very easy to use. After using this machine for the projects described I came away very impressed with the quality of the laminations and the ease of use. The machine is hefty with good build quality. On their own, they noticed the one done by this machine had a much closer edge, and each also noticed the flatness of it once I turned each lamination.Overall, this laminator is sturdy and seems to be well-made. All in all this is a great machine and worth the price IMHO. Also, the machine autorecognizes what is being laminated, and so far after a month of use, does incredibly well; all lamination jobs are of a quality much higher than we ever experienced with the less expensive machine.We have been very happy with this laminator, and actually cannot come up with any complaints with the product itself. This would have taken forever on our old machine (even if we could get it to do that large size of pouch, which we couldn't). This is an excellent machine. This is a bulky machine, but worth the space it uses.I have had a number of other laminators over the years. You will feel the pouch being pulled in by the machine when you have inserted it far enough into the slot. With this beautiful machine, it makes life simple. This machine is big and heavy, it takes a lot of room on the desktop.
