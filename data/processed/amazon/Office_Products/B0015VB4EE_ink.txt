It's not as dark as the Pilot G2 black ink but looks fine on letter writing paper. The ink does not flow readily from the rollerball tip unless I store the pen in an upright position. The ink's still great and does dry to a mostly waterproof state. I'll bypass the ink as I've never met a Noodler ink I didn't love, and go right to the free fountain pen; a pen that gives you the option of swapping the nib for a fine roller point. This is the darkest black ink that I've found. Most of the ink that passes for &#34;black&#34; is actually like a dark grey, and not dark dark black. Noodler's Heart of Darkness is a very dark ink. The only other Noodler's ink that seems as dark is Noodler's Black. Noodler's Heart of Darkness is my favorite black ink. They write even better with this ink than they do out of the box. Love this ink and the pen that comes with it. The ink flows well using my free pen and the Ahab fountain pen I use. love this ink! This smooth flowing ink is a dark black color - what you imagine and assume black ink ought to be, but discover it seldom really is. The Heart of Darkness ink and the demonstrator eyedropper pen are truly a great combination!Recommended! Nice ink, using with multiple fountain pens. This has to be the richest, darkest, smoothest blank ink I have ever had the the pleasure of using in any of my pens. This ink is very permanent and very black. It seems to work well too.INKThe ink is very black and opaque, in bright light most black inks have a slight blue hue to them that you can see on the edges of the words on paper, this ink has a brownish gray hue. This is the best black ink I have used so far and I write with it daily...
