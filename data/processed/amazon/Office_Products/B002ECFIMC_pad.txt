That is exactly what you get in this pad of labels. The pad format keeps the variety together! They come packed conveniently in a pad format (four labels per sheet) so it's easy to keep in your desk drawer. The compact pad, versus the old-school rolls (do they even make those anymore?) The pad design is outstanding, rather than having to fish little sheets of labels out of a box every time you need one. These are like a pad of paper with 4 labels per page. This handy pad makes sure a stack is always handy and accessible. First of all, they come in a pad format, so they're all neat and stacked and they don't get scattered about in a drawer or storage box. What I found most practical is the the pad they are bound on. The pad is a nice size that fits into a drawer and are readily available. It is just a great little pad of file folder labels. This pad of labels is everything Avery says: Convenient, color-coded file folder labels. A simple pad of file labels creates much work for an old retired guy! There is a whole pad of them, so you can easily stick a label over another one that is already placed. The pad holds 160 labels, more than enough for most home office projects.They're also useful for labeling other items, too. The pad itself can be handy instead of dealing with individual sheets of labels. Having these on a Post-It like pad is quite convenient! I really liked these Avery Permanent File Folder Label Pad: each pad includes 160 write-on 1/3 cut labels, color-coded in blue, red, green & yellow.The use: I am a big fan of 1/3 cut tabbed file folders (I use them all the time), and I usually write with an ultra fine point sharpie, the name of the folder in the tab area. Now I just keep a pad in my desk drawer, and if I need one, it takes two seconds.Not that this has come up, but if someone needed a couple of labels, I'd be able to provide them quickly and easily...without giving up a dozen of them. It would have been nice if you can buy each pad of one color or you have one color on each sheet. All you do is write on them, peel them off the pad and stick them on a file folder or other item. The pad is sturdy, easy to carry around and the design of the label makes it easy to write on the label. The pad is so sturdy that if you want to have 20 file folders with the same color label on each you can remove 20 blue labels, for example, from 20 consecutive pages without the pages separating form the pad. The pad contains 40 pages, and on each page are 4 labels, for a total of 160 labels.
