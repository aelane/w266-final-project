The wireless connection has been trouble free in operation. I was able to connect it to my wireless network and use it from two different computers.- Installation of the drivers was simple and easy. With the wireless network for our laptop, we had to download new drivers as the drivers on the disc didn't work with Windows 7. Epson WorkForce 630 Color Ink Jet All-in-One is a very fast wireless printer that will let you print with good quality, scan, copy, fax, with 250-sheet paper capacity, and print directly from mobile devices with its Wi-Fi connection.Pros:1. The wireless even found other computers in the house and connected to them. Have yet to try out the wireless capabilities as previous experiences have left me wary of what might happen. However, the wireless printing does seem faster than the HP wireless printer that I had. * Easy wireless setup* Good quality text and graphics* Manual 2-sided printing so you still have to be there to flip* Good size - 250-sheet paper tray means you re-load paper less often I also recently went wireless at home and this was my first attempt to connect a wireless device to my network.

Although it is not needed if you want to install strictly wireless (if you have a wireless router).

The Epson WorkForce 630 is a very affordable wireless multi-function printer/fax/scanner.

It sets up easily, working with your wireless home network to allow multiple users/computers to share print and scan resources.
