The tab's a good idea to keep your fingers off the adhesive backing, but at the junction between the label and the tab there is a micro-perforation that sometimes make you work a bit at removing the tab cleanly. After the tab is removed, the label is a 3x1 rectangle.Performance on paper:Standard ballpoint pen and gel inks worked fine, could be read easily, and didn't smudge when fully dry. But the tab is perforated so it tears off in a clean, straight line. I also like the tiny perforated tab that you can leave sticking outside the folder (to draw attention to something) or to use as a bookmark or to rip off so the entire tab/note stays stuck (unless you really want to remove it, then you can if you just wedge your nail under a corner).Overall, I would highly recommend this item. The tab can be torn off pretty nicely, if you don't want them on the labels.These could not easily be printed on using a computer printer, or a typewriter, as they are sticky. You can leave the tab on and use it to easily remove a label, or tear the tab off for a semi-permanent use. Even with the tab removed however the labels can be removed fairly easily if needed.There are several instances when these are very helpful. They have adhesive covering all but a small tab that is perforated and removable, so they really stick--until you don't want them to. Holding the tab you can stick the label to envelope/folder/etc and then remove the perforated tab. It was necessary to use the tab or a fingernail to remove it but I still wouldn't recommend them for mailing packages without covering them with clear tape as they don't seem to stick to paper quite as well as the hard surface.They are meant to be removable and are, so the most appropriate use would be when there is a need to remove the label later, as on food containers or to mark books. Its easy to pull the tab and change the label when needed and not the folder. The non-stick tab makes it easy to lift.BUT...1. The non-stick tab sometimes rips apart from the main label and then the label becomes not so easy to lift.You can work around issue #1 by dealing with each pad independantly. They have a little removable tab on the end so that when you pull them off the stack you don't crinkle the label trying to lift it off. The tab is perforated to allow it to be easily torn off if you choose to remove it.---I'd recommend these labels for the permanent/semi-permenent labeling and color-coding your file folders, loose sheets, and other documents. Each comes with a perforated non-sticky tab that you can keep attached if you want something that's easy to grab, or removed to give the label a little more permanence (though still easy to peel off if needed).I can imagine a lot of different uses for these labels...food containers, file folders, whatever you can think of. If you leave the tab on, it can be used to quickly and easily remove the label after use. The rounded tab has no sticky so you can easily pull off one at a time and the tab can be left on for labels you will be removing frequently or removed for a more permanent but still removable application. Easy to remove and re-apply due to that tab. If you want to leave it on more permanently, you can also remove the tab since it's perforated. There is also a tab at the end to tear off but often tears the label when you do so and is stubborn to remove. There is a non stick tab on the side of the label for easy placement. *There is a little perforated tab edge for easy removal.Great uses:*On the front of a library book with the due date written on it as a reminder. That tab will also cleanly tear off so that after the label is stuck down it looks nice.

There is a very necessary perforated tab on one end of the label which makes separating each individual label from the pad easy.

That small tab may be torn off once the label is in hand.What appealed to me is the removable feature.

Only the little tab at the end remains free.
