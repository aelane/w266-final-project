One thing is that in places, the plastic feels cheap. This thing prints very fast and has a compact form. The one thing I do not really like about the printer is there is no manual feed like other printers have. But with the 845, like the 635, this thing just really does it all great.My only complaint (and I've heard this before) is that I do wish the largest capacity ink cartridge was larger. This thing does it all with gusto.The wireless feature is a lifesaver and I will never go back.My only complaint...replacement inks are STILL expensive. I don't know where to begin.I guess the first thing is this printer came with full ink cartridges and that was a good surprise since most printers come with starter ink only. but the only thing that seems to work is to uninstall/reinstall the printer . And a great thing about it? I call this thing the monster, because it dominates my home office. So now the only thing left is to tell you what other wonderful things this thing can do. The first thing I noticed with the Epson is how much lighter it is than my other All-in-Ones, which is nice when I need to move things around in my tight spaces.It was a breeze setting it up with my Windows OS but a bit of a challenge with the Mac because of conflicting instructions on a sheet and in the book.I LOVE the 500 sheet paper capacity drawers right in the front for easy access, I won't be running out of paper as soon on this.Several of my printers do the Duplex printing, but none are nearly as fast as my Epson WorkForce 845. The first thing that I noticed about the Epson WorkForce 845 is it's speed. One thing that surprised me is the printer's ability to generate ruled papers such as wide ruled classroom paper and even graph paper. The very first thing I did after hooking up this printer (I mean, plugging it in) was to see if it would pop up for connection to my wireless network. One thing I really like is how easy it is to print double sided with this one. The first thing you'll notice about the Epson WorkForce 845 Wireless Color Printer is the excellent packaging. One really nice thing about an All in One is that you have the flatbed option for scanning so I could use it for odd-shaped items or older photos that I wouldn't trust in a feeder. Which is a great thing for consumers purchasing the lower cost versions.In a nutshell... this printer does it's primary job (print) very very well. The only thing I can really see is when looking at the specs and comparing side by side, it seems the hardware resolution on the 845 is lower than the 840, but not by much, and when compared directly to the same print from the 840, I don't see any difference at all.For configuration purposes, I used only Windows based PCs (an XP and Win 7 machine). The one thing that is annoying is that when one color runs out of ink you can not select to print in black and white.
