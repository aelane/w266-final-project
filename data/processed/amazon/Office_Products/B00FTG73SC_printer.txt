This Epson printer is a great deal at a more than reasonable price &#8211; how many times can you say that these days. I wasn't too keen on setting this printer up, the one I am currently using works fine. The printer I was using, another Epson, had to be housed on the floor due to its weight. I really liked this printer until it came time to replace the ink cartridges.When I need to buy a printer I look at the prices of the cartridges, and the ones for this printer were very cheap. I needed a new printer, so I thought I'd try this one. I highly recommend this printer to anyone who wants a wireless printer and print photos. This printer is also a copier and scanner. So much for such a compact printer. This is the smallest printer that we have used yet it can print, scan and copy. This printer does have a very small LCD screen on the front that is part of the control panel. Overall I think this printer gives you so much at such a low cost that it's hard not to love. I'm happy with this printer. My new printer is working wonderfully!I've made copies on color and printed things from my computer.Didn't know wireless printers worked sooo, well. I got this printer for my mother in law for Christmas. This is an incredible printer for its price. This Epson XP-310 printer is a great for printing documents and photos. The printer was very easy to set up. You set up the printer, install the ink cartilages, prime the ink, and then you can set up the software on a computer. The printer instructions recommend using a USB cable and it is not included with the printer so make sure you have one with you if you do it that way.After installation, I tested the printers many options. The printer can also scan photos and documents onto your computer. This printer is no exception. I highly recommend this printer for those who need a basic printer but want a nice job done. I wanted a printer that I could connect to my netbook, since that is what I use the majority of the time.Having a printer that I would have to attach to the netbook defeats the purpose of having the netbook, so this printer seemed like a good option.Set up was pretty simple ,once I knew what I was doing. I'm extremely pleased with this printer. This is surprising because the printer is supposed to support the wireless standard (802.11 N) which operates in the 54 to 600 Mbps range. The printer also supports Apple AirPrint.When scanning a document the menu  selections are to do it directly to a PC as a JPEG (picture) or PDF (document) file, embed the scanned image in an email, or start a WSD (Web Services on Device) session on a Windows 7 or 8 computer. This printer costs sixty bucks, and it copy's, print's, and scan's. I needed a printer that would print wirelessly across our house because we now have three computers. The EPSON XP-310 is an okay printer that should do good service for an individual.Installation was quick. The printer was very easy to install and took only a few minutes to hook it up. If not, and your printer needs are more, then please by a quality product. We had a multifunctional printer that worked well but for reasons of space we had to move it around constantly, so we started looking for a color inkjet with scanning capabilities (which we use quite often) that were of a more convenient size. Enter the XP-310What you get with this printer is really worth it for the price, which I found very affordable. When the printer is priced no higher than a single supply of ink cartridges, I see no reason not to replace it.But hold on! I've been using my Canon printer for quite a while. Update 6/12/14:  I love this printer! That was easy enough, and then the printer printed wirelessly.Next, I installed the printer on a six-year-old Dell laptop, which has problems with software CDs, due to Security Pack 1 not being recognized after reinstalling Vista a year ago. The laptop recognized the printer was on the network, but it would only print using a USB cord. Nice printer! Nice printer for the price! Anyway, it's small and lightweight, so you can schelp this printer around anywhere. It's nice being able to put the printer wherever you want. Although it does not come with a printer USB cord to set up the wireless mode, it is a standard inexpensive cord that is easy to find. Still, this printer exceeded even my high expectations.Here's what to love:- Wireless connection (a must, don't buy any printer without it)- Stunning, color-rush photo printing- Scanner/Copier feature- Great PriceSome Cons:- Doesn't include USB cable- Not multi-purpose, it's strictly designed for photo printing- Runs through ink quickly (most printer companies seem to be in the &#34;ink business&#34; and not the &#34;printer business&#34; - you'll no doubt spend a lot on buying new ink cartridges.

In general, let me mention that the first printer I ever bought cost $400 and lasted me about 7 years.

I have always wanted a printer to print my photos and now I have one that prints photos and is wireless as well.
