Overall, a decent little item. This is a great little item to have on hand when getting ready to do any school projects. Removing the item is simple enough and there are no signs of damage, as long as you remove carefully.I find this adhesive device useful and practical and I like that it can be refilled. I have found this item to be useful, especially in my craft room. This is cerainly a cool item for certain things. This is an item that I will be purchasing again in the near future. This is a handy little item, works pretty well for what it is supposed to do. Just press down on the item you want to stick to paper and you will see a light blue line that comes out. This item works very well at putting a small line of glue dots in place. I think I could send an item sealed with this, but I am still cautious about it.

It's a small item and I've no idea if its greener than a glue-stick - all I can say is it seems less messy and with less glue around it could be more efficient.In summary, I like the device, it's clean for sticking items to posterboard and for scrapbooking.

In its item description it is said over and over how it replaces glue.

This item will have your photos sticking like a charm with no curling edges.I was skeptical at first (dots...who knew), but then I tried it and voila!
