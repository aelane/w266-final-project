But it sharpens every single pencil perfectly, every single time. Having tried my other pencil sharpeners to sharpen our regular and colored pencils. It moves easily and it causes the pencil to just miss.One good thing is that the suction feet worked well and the sharpener doesn't move when being used.I tried 5 pencils when I first got it, before I placed it at the school. This is one serious pencil sharpener. In the past I had done some pencil sketching and have been considering taking it back up. So when I saw this pencil sharpener I was interested. Perhaps I'm pushing the pencil or holding it at a tilt, although after the first non-centered pencil, I did deliberately try to insert the pencil as straight as possible.I haven't given up on it yet, but so far my old manual Boston does a more consistent job of sharpening straight. It sharpens a pencil to a nice fine point in under 3 seconds.I love that it has a dial to adjust for 6 different sizes and that it has a nice big clear reservoir for shavings. That means the pencil is not lined up very well when you insert it. This is my 5th pencil sharpener. Seriously though, I have bought so many electric pencil sharpeners. It allows you to change the pencil size, thus giving it a great sharpen all the way around the pencil, not just on half (leaving wood on the other half). I do like the Super Pro 6's Tip Saver Technology, which ensures a nice pencil point instead of an overdone, needle-like point that's sure to break. They have one, EPS11HC , which is colored pencil compatible however.In good conscience I really can't recommend this for a class-room.
