The pad is nicely designed:- It looks pretty and sleek. The pad is good for putting on your fridge and jotting down items that you may need at the grocery store. This magnetic pad does stick and stays securely attached to the fridge when I am writing on it and when I try to gently tear-off a sheet. The pad has a sturdy top and backing. The pad has two large magnets on the back and it sticks to our refrigerator very good. The pad has three sections: To Do, To Remember, & To Buy. I found the pad a little pricey and would have preferred a blank pad or instead if the categories were vertical instead of horizontal to make it easier to take just one list section off the pad instead of all of them. Also if you think this pad would work for you, note that it comes in various colors. If the pad was designed without magnets, then it would be placed at your desk or somewhere where there is a pen or pencil. This pad is great, durable because it is magnetic. It is so nice to just grab this pad to write quick notes. I don&#8217;t use it because the pad stays pretty straight when I have it on my refrigerator. And it's a pretty thick pad also. It's an ok pad. This pad is perforated in three spots.....now that may seem like a good idea, but intuitively, I write form the top down so when it's time to take my list with me, I have to tear from the top, even if nothing is on the bottom 2 / 3 sheets....and that means that I'm wasting them. This little pad of paper does what I need it to do.

They barely hold the pad in place.

I got one free pad to review, but I would not purchase another.

I must say that this magnetic pad works much better than the ones I receive at my doorstep for free, however I don't know if the cost outweighs the benefit.Usually when I receive the free ones, I still try to use the magnet part of the notepad to hang things.
