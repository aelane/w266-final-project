When you step up to this sharpener and this is a big step up from the regular household sharpeners, you're paying for quality. !Cleaning this sharpener was as easy as could be and I am amazed at the level of quality. The sharpener is very heavy, stays in place on the desk, and is good looking.My only complaint would be size. The sharpener accepts many different styles of pencils, even triangular shaped architecture pencils. I tried this sharpener out on several different colored art pencils, from an inexpensive hard lead set to a very fragile set of Venus Paradise very soft thick lead pencils from the late 60's. I was truly impressed with a sharpener that could sharpen old brittle colored pencils with soft lead from the 60's into the smoothest point ever, as this sharpener did.I also have an array of sketch pencils in different leads from super hard to super soft and they all came out just as beautiful as my colored pencils did. The sharpener itself has 6 different sized pencil holes for your different pencils. I was curious to see how much better a $100 sharpener would perform, so I ordered the Stanley Bostitch Super Pro Glow Commercial Pencil Sharpener to evaluate and review.The sharpener arrives well-packaged against damage. This sharpener is a lot larger in size than I expected. To test the sharpener I used several different No. The sharpener sharpened all of them quickly and with minimal effort. They love that the sharpener doesn't move around (suction feet), that it doesn't eat their pencils (even color pencils), the light reliably lights when the pencil is done, and all pencils are accomidated (even Tri-Write shapes) by simply spinning the faceplate.
