The ink cartridges installed quickly. My last Epson the XP 800 actually runs out of ink after printing 20 pages. They also have been going for larger ink cartridges instead of micro like epson.The speed on this one is great, and the printing result is better than any printer in its price range. The high-cost ink cartridges, however, outweighed the high quality, and because my home office work needs changed from printing photograph quality to being able to scan multiple documents, I decided to switch to the office type printer.To my surprise, MX922 prints really beautifully and quickly. These ink cartridges are the ones that use gravity to drop the ink, so a piece of tape or screw had to be used to maintain a vacuum inside the tank. It is cheap, and ink is not too bad in cost either. Originally, I was going to go for the more expensive Canon MG7120, but when I saw it had an additional ink (gray), I became concerned. Oddly enough, Canon was selling a four ink value pack with no gray, which meant, you had to hunt down gray on its own. Just plop in your ink carts, watch each ink chamber light up to signal correct contact, install the CD and you're good to go.Ease of use: Simple! The MX922 is not an ink hog, though cartridges are still more costly than I would like.There are other features such as printing directly on optical media which I rarely, if ever, use. Included were ink, a power cord, and a phone cord, but no USB cable.The printer has a fairly large footprint and looks bulky. It's easy to add more ink. How is it chewing through so much ink?To a newcomer, I'm sure the MX922 is an exceedingly good printer. I have used Canon ink jet printers for many years. As with HP and Epson, the ink tanks are disgustingly expensive. There are four ink cartridges but when one color runs out it can be changed singly without having to change them all at once. It came with the requisite ink tanks of course. I am still using the ink cartridges that came with it so I cannot yet attest to how much use you get out of them but it seems like they are going a long way. While the ink never lasts as long as I would like, the MX922 usually produces colors that are accurate, and the prints have a decent amount of detail.For $90 as a Deal of the Day, the MX922 was a good buy, but I hope that this printer  is more durable than my previous Pixma printers, which although lightly used, mysteriously died for no apparent reason after lasting just over a year.It seems that every time I get a new printer, Canon has developed a new type of ink cartridge, so I can't use my old supply of ink. The old one tended to eat ink as well - the jury is still out on this one, though the cartridges for the 922 are cheaper.
