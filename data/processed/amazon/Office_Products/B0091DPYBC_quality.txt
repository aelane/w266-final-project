Having used those in the past I can say that while the quality of photos on this printer when using special photo paper is okay, but specialized printers seem to produce crisper printed images that have a broader range of colors. I am delighted with the quality of printed material. Don't expect the quality of the photos to be anything you win a photo contest award with or anything. The quality of the prints and copies I have made were excellent. Very good quality prints for the price and size of this printer.There is no back light on the LCD display, therefore, you cannot read anything on the display without enough room lighting. I have to say I'm impressed by the quality of the prints and copies this printer makes. But still the quality is great, so I can't complain all tha tmuch.It does hook up with pretty much anything without a cable making it quite flexible from a positioning standpoint and the footprint considering its functionality is very very small. The quality of print images that it puts out are better than other printers that I own and, as long as the refill cartridges are cost-effective, I'll consider this a great addition to my home office space (they're not, so it's not).It does what it's supposed to do, well, and quickly (but not inexpensively): scanning, copying, and printing is fast, easy, and, with the remote printing app, can be done from anywhere that you may need to... For the on-the-go business person that has the need to conduct business away from home, but still print there from a distance, who doesn't mind burning through money to keep the toner stocked and, consequently, the printer functioning, this Epson covers the bases, and at a price for the machine itself that's more than fair. Printing quality is great.6. But nevertheless, what it does have is quality. The quality is pretty good for a inkjet too, and despite it not being specifically designed for photo printing I found that the quality of photos was pretty up to par with other printers.I also like the fact that Epson uses relatively cheap ink units that are separate. The quality of the printed pages is acceptable in comparison to other printers having the same functions.
