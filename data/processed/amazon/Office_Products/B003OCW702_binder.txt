This binder might be better suited for training classes with adults in attendance. The customizable binder measures 11.5 inches x 10.75, while the non-customizable one is 11.5 x 11 inches. Everything inside of the binder is the exact same, so the following review is the same for the insides of the binder for the customizable and non-customizable hybrid notebinders.It has a 200 sheet capacity, and it comes with 2 tabbed notepockets, and 3 tabbed noteprotectors. Then where the binder usully has the spine, the hybrid has a sturdy fabric to save space and so that the hybrid binderbook can be folded and lay flat. I just can't fork over $15 a hybrid binder for every single one of my classes, but with the 200 sheet capacity, you could combine a few classes into one binder.The customizable and non-customizable hybrid notebinders seem to be the same price right now, so I would get the customizable one. Maybe they could offer a hybrid binder without the fancy dividers and paper to bring down the cost. The binder is like its name, flexible, but is extremely durable, as is the fabric (nylon, perhaps?) Sadly, compared to a binder with normal pockets (which a packet of papers WOULD fit into), this thing doesn't compare favorably. Compare that with your average 1 inch binder, which only costs about two-three dollars (or your standard notebook, which is also pretty cheap), and you have to seriously ask yourself how much you really like this item. This binder is really useful because of its flexibility. It's not quite as easy to open and close as a standard binder, so keep that in mind. I believe the three-ring binder is a one-inch so it holds quite a bit of material.I would give it 4 stars out of 5. The binder is very light-weight so it doesn&#8217;t add to the weight of paper. As a binder, you can put in pages when you need to, remove pages without ripping them out, and there are dividers so you can categorize your paperwork. There's not resounding "CLICK" when you open and close the binder, and you can sneak papers in during lectures without bothering anyways. This is a binder you will not be using long term, most likely.The overall look and feel of the notebinder is that of a standard Five Star Notebook. It's a binder that is flexible, with rings on the outside so it can be folded back on itself, which is a nice touch when you are writing notes on the go, or if you have a small desk space to work on. Unlike a binder that needs to fully open, this can be folded back like a spiral notebook. A three-inch binder will always take up three inches of space, but this will only be as big as you need it to be.It's nice that you can put something in the front to customize it, but I almost think it would look nicer without the plastic cover.Overall, does a little bit of everything, and so far has held up well. The binder rings did get a little out of alignment and pages would get stuck as you turned them, but it was so much lighter than other binder systems that he requested it again for the following years. Is it a binder? It comes with three-ring binder clips (that take a little bit of effort to open), page dividers, pockets and more. This is a very useful binder. This is a cool binder that might be just the thing for my 9th Grader to carry to her classes during the day.What I like about it is that it comes with both lined paper and graph paper which can be restocked from our supply as she uses it up. This binder has the cloth, but the large plastic rings are outside of the cloth. I noticed that this binder is more flexible than most, but I had to do some research to figure out why that would ever be an advantage. Having a binder like this to carry around would have allowed me to keep all of my schedules (class, teaching,work, home maintenance) together and avoid scheduling conflicts. This binder is flexible enough to have been folded lengthwise and stuck in the back of my pants. HOWEVER, this binder won't break if/when you drop it.It's light, flexible, and appears durable. looking for a soft and yet durable binder then this is it. and I love the easy and soft binder rings. I am unable to write directly in a standard 3-ring binder, but I was able to do so in this one. But if you're happy using a binder, I don't see any reason to switch to this one.
