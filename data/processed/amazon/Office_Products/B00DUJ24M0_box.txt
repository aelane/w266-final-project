Anyway, the box is perfect for throwing in a backpack and storing in a locker at school, or keeping in your desk drawer at home.-- Debra Hamel The box is indeed sturdy, and everything fits nicely, but it's not attractive (the label was put right on the box and sent to me) and kind of a pain to use. I don't use the box everything came in, but have put all the products in a pencil case sized pouch made of mesh. This little box of goodies is perfect for any student or office worker. It comes in a little compact box, so it's great for a trip or gift/stocking stuffer. I keep my box of special post-it products right beside my computer with a couple of pens and have everything I need to work efficiently and happily in one place. When the box came in the mail it was so small I couldn't remember ordering anything that size. Some may see this as a little box of dull student/office supplies, but others will lovingly gaze at it every time they open it. This neat little box of organizing tools from Post-It is just what the college and/or high school student needs for studying. It comes in a nondescript yet sturdy little box.

The box arrives, you open it up, and you have a nice portable selection of products at hand without having to rip open a bunch of packages and divide the packing material among your recycling bins.
