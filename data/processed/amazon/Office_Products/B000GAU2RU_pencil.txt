The 1000 pencil retracts so you can carry it arround in your pockets without it cutting through it. Best pencil ever! This pencil meets (and exceeds) all of my requirements. If you like writing/drawing with a pencil, this is a perfect choice. If this pencil had a thicker size to it, I'd only use this pencil. Nothing like ordering a new pencil and getting one with a sticker on it thrown in a sizable box with some air packets, like it is some sort of second hand item or return?Upon analyzing the pencil the first thing I noted was that where the clip mechanism locks into the barrel it is held by a plastic recess...this metal clip being opened and closed a lot upon plastic material just does not bode well for the plastic parts. I use a pencil for writing at work, do not use this as a Drafting Pencil. This is a very sturdy pencil. I've never really bought a nice pencil before, so this is my first experience with one. The pencil is great. This pencil is solid and my most favorite pencil. I guess theoretically there could be one pencil that excels at both needs, but if there is, I haven't found it. I used it as my pencil that I carried around. Sadly, there just doesn't seem to be a pencil out there that meets this. But back to this pencil, its eraser is small and useless, but no more so than its competitors, so it stays in the pole position for the pocket pencil.Also a bit disappointing is the grip. This is a super nice pencil and very comfortable to write with. This pencil accepts different sized leads, a very useful feature to have, especially if you do a lot of sketching/drawing. This pencil, it appears, was designed mainly for drawing, since it is too tiring to do any type of writing for too long. I've been a heavy mechanical pencil user since high school when I took drafting 1&2. I grabbed a pencil from someone else recently to jot down a note and quickly remembered how much I like them so I wanted to find a good one for myself.I've purchased 8 pencils in the last 2 months trying to find what I wanted. Very comfortable.Overall I'm very pleasantly surprised with this pencil and after searching around from different brands and price ranges, this one will be my standard going forward. I'm sad I didn't get some of these sooner.This pencil is the best mechanical pencil I've ever used. This is a great and cool mechanical pencil. The pencil has a nice weight (heavy enough to be steady, light enough to prevent fatigue). My pencil came up missing about a month ago. This pencil is all metal. The heaviest pencil of the 5 9mm pencils I purchased. It's an awesome pencil that I'll never live without and comes in all the popular lead sizes. It's the pencil that rules over all other pencils.
