I had to sit on the chair and bounce to push it back down. I got this chair and was shocked to see how large of a box it came in, the box was large to keep everything nice and secure during transport. That was it and I had a very sturdy and solid chair. The chair is perfect for sitting at the art table where you need to be higher to reach every inch of the canvas. This chair is very comfortable and adjustable to personal preference. The chair is designed for use at a workbench, easel, or countertop. So if you've set it up to fit you, but then decide you'd like the chair to be higher, you'll also have to adjust the footrest. I highly recommend this chair, and enjoy using it every time I am in my workshop. The chair feels too high on the lowest setting, bolts were missing from the original shipment but the manufacturer replaced them within 8 business days, very sturdy and comfortable. Great chair and easy to assemble. The chair goes up and down and swivels smoothly.Function: It does not descend to office chair level so you won't be able to use it as one. I highly recommend this if you're looking for a high chair for the office. It is a full fledged chair that rolls around and swivels plus it hold me with no problems. The chair is easy to put together and if instructions were not included it would not matter too much. Overall a super chair and it was so nice to be surprised as I was when I took it out of the box. This was not the easiest chair to put together, the instructions (all pictures) failed on one or two minor points. But once put together, the chair itself was sturdy, and pleasant to use.It has holes for arms (not included).The hydraulic strut (and the foot support) are the only adjustments. As is, it is a nice enough chair. This chair is great. Prior to receiving this chair, I was looking for one that wasn't overly expensive, was comfortable and matched my office decor. If this chair was just a little bit shorter I would haven given it 5 stars. I recommend this chair. The chair has a footrest built in which you can adjust up and down.Assembly was really easy. The chair is nice and stable even when I'm perched on the highest setting, freely swinging my feet...  Basically if you have a need for a comfortable, padded stool, and the office chairs just aren't tall enough to do the job, this is probably the one you want.NOTE: does not include arms. Overall, satisfied with the chair. This would be a good chair in a church media booth, a drafting chair or for anyone who moves around a lot. Love this chair! The HON Volt Task Stool is a very sturdy high chair with adjustable height options and very easily assembly for an office type chair.T
