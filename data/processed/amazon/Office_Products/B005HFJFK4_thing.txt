But there's rarely such thing as a free lunch and in this case the 'price' we pay is a bulkier/heavier body (added doc feeder) and a higher... price.Epson's Artisan 837 adds and improves on the Artisan 720's series as follows:- The added FAX send/receive capability absent in the 720 series make the 837 a true 'all-in-one' printer.- The 30-sheet document feeder is a significant productivity booster and makes it a better 'small business' printer.- A larger touch display allows for intuitive and detailed controls.- Unlike previous Artisan (700 series) models, the 837 can print almost as soon as it's turned on.- Physical design improvements include covers for both the document feeder and the paper output area to protect them from dust with the latter opening (bot not closing) automatically when the printer is turned on.INSTALLATIONI experienced near-zero issues during setup. Biggest thing is EPSON need to lower the price of their refill packs and the Color Preferences need to work for more than just newer high quality paper.4 STARS The other positive thing I found is that Epson handled my initial problem quickly and professionally and they immediately sent me a new machine.And one last comment:  I'm using this product with an Apple iMac, running Mac OS X version 10.6.8. That's really the only negative thing I have to say about this excellent unit. What an awesome thing to be able to print pictures without changing the paper. And the amazing thing was that when I held the two photos side by side I could not tell a difference in quality. It is hard to fit this thing on a standard sized desk. The only bad thing I can think of is the cost of the ink cartridges. This thing does it all.I have not yet used the duplex feature. The other thing I wish it came with is a manual paper tray. This is the only thing that may keep me from purchasing this printer for some of the staff in our office.If you're considering an All-In-One, I know of no better printer than the 837. The only thing I haven't tested yet is the direct CD printing. The first thing you notice, other than just how massive that this printer happens to be, is the huge touch-screen LCD screen which is a joy to use.
