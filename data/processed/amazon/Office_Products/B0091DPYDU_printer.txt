It is quiet and efficient, exactly what I want in a printer. We decided to replace our printer because we could never get the wifi connection to work properly in Windows 8. The printer has worked fine every since. I've got to say that I'm happy with my Epson Workforce printer. Very easy to get the printer up and running. I did uninstall and re-install and the printer worked fine after that. This printer also uses up to 70 percent less power than laser printers, 40 percent lower printing costs vs a laser printer as well. This printer does just about everything one could ask for! That was my last printer. I recommend this printer for home use, and possibly for a small office. However, this printer connects to your home's Wi-Fi network(just make sure it doesn't jump to other connections by accident) and you're all set! I have had this printer about a month now and am very impressed with the way it works. I love that it is a wireless printer to cut down on the extra cords running everywhere. The printer has a 500 sheet capacity which will last a long time before you have to refill. The printer is fairly quite and doesn't make alot of noise like some printers that I have used in the past. This is an Inkjet printer and the cartridges can be a little pricey but you can find some reasonable remanufactured ones that work jus great. I am replacing a Brother Laser printer that lasted about four years. The printer is great. My last printer by Epson was a much lower model and printed slow, only a few pages per minute. This printer, however, is very quick and I can print a whole 20 pages in under a minute. The printer was very easy to set up with the disc and the wireless works great. I really like that this printer can hold an entire ream of paper as well. I am very pleased with the printer and will definitely get Epson, especially in this class of printer, again. This printer is:* easy to set up,* the duplexer works great,* print is high quality and fast.The ability to print from mobile devices is very desirable, and the cost of ink is much less than with my other printers, including another Epson.Highly recommended! The Epson WorkForce WF-3540 Wireless printer (All in one, color, INKJET), handles copying, scanning, printing and faxing: it even does two-sided prints:  Epson's All-in-One WORKFORCE line of printers are excellent. Still, I would highly recommend the Epson WORKFORCE WF-3540 printer for all your printing needs! I was beyond excited to receive this Epson WorkForce Wireless All in One printer from the Amazon Vine Program! The printer practically set itself up! My primary printer is a Brother laser. I LOVE that printer. Way worse than any other printer I've had. Typically I just have to use the printer touchscreen to re-connect to wifi, but sometimes it takes much more. The Epson Workforce WF-3540 Wireless printer is a great printer, producing high quality color images. Getting the printer to play with an Ipad 2 was also easy.2. It's a solid printer with a look and feel of quality, about it. That printer was a nightmare in terms of setting it up. You will not find a better printer at this price point. This printer has never failed to deliver for her or myself. This printer is a BOSS! This printer was easy to set up and easy to use. NOPE.So, when this printer came up to test - I jumped on it! Like HP in the 1990, Epson has become the printer company to beat.The Epson WorkForce WF-3540 is a solid printer, copier, scanner, and fax machine. This is a great printer, very easy to setup wirelessly the first time, when you install another computer is even easily, if you need to print something from your mobile device you just send to print and that's it, AirPrint works great with zero set up, I print a mail from my iPod and was very easy I'm so happy with this printer, print quality is very good,  Color touch screen on printer is bright and clear, and makes using the machine very simple you can print front and back. Once again you can set the WiFi up directly from the printer - just know your router password. This printer is very to easy to setup and operate with a clear bright touch screen. The Espon WF-3540 is an all around great printer you cant go wrong trying this one and it really is user friendly. Once I had my printer plugged in and the ink in it, set up took 3 minutes for the network and pc connectivity. I've not encountered that yet with this printer, but if I do, I'll update my review to let you know. For a mid-range printer this is a nice choice. All too often, the printer will uptake two, three, or evenfour sheets on a single pass.The Epson is easily configured for wireless and most importantly, is Windows8 compatible.Updated drivers are downloadable from the Epson website. I got this printer to replace an old Canon MP980. She and I have our own USB printer units....having this one as a WiFi is absolutely great...and, this unit has a double paper drawer. They can directly print on your printer by emailing it to your printer's email address! Besides using the printer for shipping labels, documents & other normal business needs I also use it to print out a lot of product labels. I hooked up the printer on 10-29-12 & ran out of ink on 12-27-12. When you need a new printer, get this one. Or better yet, just get this one & keep your other printer as a back up printer should something go wrong! We used aBelkin Hi-Speed USB 2.0 Cable (10 Feet)that we had previously bought for our old printer, and it worked great.Second, I haven't priced out replacement ink yet, so I can't comment on that, but it's worth considering. If not, then this is still a great printer with everything you would expect at the high end (duplex scanning, touch screen LCD, duplex printing, wireless connectivity, etc)Also, not related to this printer in particular, but a change for the better can be seen with the availability of cheaper "compatible" Epson ink, which was almost impossible to find a couple of years ago. But there is more to a printer now then firmware.Here's my Research and comments...The manufacturer states that this New Epson WF-3540 will have improved durability over previous model with no mention that I find to the model it is replacing. All said, what I want is a reliable printer that doesn't hurt my pocket book. A printer that lets me print, fax, scan, over my network without constant fuss and adjustments.So let's get the basics aside and then some analysis. My HP printer died after a few years of use so I decided to replace it with this model. If you are looking for an inexpensive printer and don't mind the noise, it is a fair product for the money. But it is still a cheap printer..... I'm happy with this printer for casual home use and I think you will be too. The printer continues to use the 127 series DURABrite ink cartridges like its previous WorkForce 845 counterpart.For fax, you can fax documents directly to/from your computer and high speed faxing in black and color as fast as 3 seconds per page, speed dial storage up to 100 numbers plus fax memory up to 180 pages.EPSON Connect allows for convenient mobile printing from smartphones, tablets and more (NOTE: iPhone and iPad users, there is an Epson app available. Also, the printer features a 30-page, duplex Auto Document Feeder to quickly copy, scan or fax stacks of 1- or 2-sided original documents.Also, what is important for me is that if there is a paper jam, you can easily remove the rear to fix any problem. Other than that, this printer is quite magnificent, I was able to print, copy, fax, scan with ease.As mentioned earlier, what I love about the recent WorkForce printers is the way it uses paper and loads, unlike many other cheaper printers in which paper gets stuck and you get the awful paper jam, I never had to worry about it with these type of printers. Obviously you can also fax it to your printer, but email is so much easier! That being said, the printer does work well now that we got the problems ironed out. So far I have used the printer, copier, scanner & fax from my HP PC, ASUS Laptop, SONY Viao laptop, iPAD & HP Touch.Pretty easy setup took about 20 minutes for this 50 year (with assist from 60 year old - lol! THIS IS A SERIOUS FLAW WHEN HARDWARE LIMITATIONS REQUIRE A CHANGE IN NETWORK SECURITY.Finally, the printer was connected to the wireless network, which brought up a whole other set of issues.The drivers for the printer, scanner, and fax are not built into Windows, like every other All-in-One I've had. The Epson printer is not Plug and Play. I would call it a printer but printing is almost the least of what it does.I've had many printers, scanners and all-in-ones over the last 30 years or so - horribly expensive ones, machines so inexpensive it was cheaper to buy new than replace the ink, and almost everything in between. That printer was not equipped with Airprint. I am upset with Epson that my last printer from them similar to this one only worked for about a year of just general home use but I decided to go with another Epson because of the price and I got it for a fairly good price. We set this printer up in a matter of minutes. This is a very very good printer to share with a household. It is MUCH faster than my old printer and that is a big plus. I go right to my dye-sub printer. I was once an HP printer loyalist. AirPrint Compatible (C11CC31201), another great printer which incidentally also uses the 126 or higher capacity 127 series Epson ink cartridges. If you purchase this printer, as of today, it's not listed in the ink cartridge finder at Amazon. Great printer. I went with this printer, which is inkjet, because I want to be able to print color photos in a decent quality. I work for HP but would recommend this printer highly. This printer replaced a Canon all-in-one that I loved, but is no longer available. Not with this printer. It's a beautiful looking printer, the speed is fast and the color printing looks good.The software is buggy though.I wasted half a day installing and reinstalling the software to enable wireless printing. It "cannot find" the printer, despite the fact that wireless printing works. I had to set the printer to "glossy" to lay down adequate ink. The printer now "Cannot recognize" the ink cartridges. Now I'm fully installed, very relieved to be done with the Epson and with a working printer, easy to use, good output quality. This printer has a lot of nice features that work well and prints out good quality prints but... it was a nightmare to install it wirelessly. I didn't even understand why a printer needed a screen, but it does make things easier. It's not where a printer should go, but I can't put it on the floor because I have a two year old who just adores shoving things in printers for all the wrong reasons. It's a printer. The printer was delivered 2 days before expected - bonus point one.Bonus point two: The &#34;starter ink cartridges lasted at least twice as long as expected. What an amazing printer!!I
