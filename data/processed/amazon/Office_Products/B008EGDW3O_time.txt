There comes a time in each nerd's (or nerdette's) life when you have to admit that things have changed.Sometimes it's obvious, such as a new technology being offered. It seems like it runs out all the time - and I'm always getting on the kids not to use color unless they absolutely need it. (The Canon also takes a long time to get ready, if left powered-off for a few days. The time to scan a single item to the PC is 3 minutes  While not a big deal for a scan or two, this will be a huge time issue if scanning in a pack of old 35mm photos. Only time will tell. A long time. This was my first time using a Epson printer.
