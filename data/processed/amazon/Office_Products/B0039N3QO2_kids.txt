They're great for kids' posters, art, and more. The kids in my family love these. Our kids love to paint, draw, scribble, etc. so great for putting up kids artwork that will get recycled... My kids use them in their rooms to attach posters to the walls and they seem to work quite well. You could use them to hang your kids' posters in their rooms or use them to hang paper items, like posters, in dorm rooms. I used it too to stick the kids' arts and crafts from school, sticking them on the fridge. I have kids and kids love posters....but I hate holes in the walls.

"Now my kids won't have to suffer the fate of bare, boring walls thanks to you.They work, they don't take paint off the wall, and even better still?

My kids were playing with my hand mirror and one of the mirrored circles (about 5" in diameter) came out.

Great for hanging the kids' artwork, too.Recommended.
