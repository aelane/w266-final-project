So I've gone through quite a few of these binders over the years. I would buy more of these binders. I'm used to binders splitting and cracking, but this one is holding up well. Many of my other binders have been ruined by ink transferring to the plastic liner.Using a binder of this quality beats having to replace the cheap ones regularly. These binders are really great. All binders are weak at the folding points, and this one isn't any better than any others I have used.The binder rings are good, they are not a D-ring or an O-ring shape, but more of a backward D would be a better description. If you don't want to replace binders in a few years, get this one. These binders hold up rather well after taking months of being crammed in and out of my locker. This is definitely a stronger one compared to my ordinary binders where papers comes out so easily after punching and filing the papers. Avery identifies binders by three quality levels "economy", "durable", heavy duty. I can safely vouch that Avery makes very durable binders that last a long time. D-ring binders are the most practical binders to fit many pages in - whether it's paper or plastic pages the D-ring binder will store them without bending them. I've gotten many cheap binders in my time because I just hate spending the money on a GOOD binder. I decided to try Avery's Heavy Duty One Touch EZD 2" binder.Like many other binders, this one has clear pockets on the front and back cover and the outer binding to accomodate identifying sheets. I have dropped full binders and had the rings pop open and allow the sheets inside to scatter. I have one of these binders for each year to hold all my important papers that come in that year. She no longer needs to keep 5 smaller binders as she has placed tabs for each individual class in her one Avery binder for easily finding what she needs.I love this single Avery binder as I no longer must drive back to her school because she has forgotten a specific homework assignment that was left in her locker (parents of pre-teen or teens know what I mean)...She now brings home only one "all in one binder" AKA... Avery Nonstick Heavy-Duty EZD Reference View 2 Inch White Binder. I use binders to organize everything...I could write a book on "101 Uses for a Binder in the Home and Office." The binders have to be clean, light, and durable to protect the contents and hold up to constant use. These are probably my favorite binders. I've been purchasing Avery binders for many years. Most of my binders only have 2 pockets which I don't always use, but maybe if you are using this in a work environment you might have a need for more pockets.I like that Avery is always trying to improve on their products. As far as binders go, I always thought it was kind of hard to get worked up about them. I think most of us have struggled with binders that don't hold enough, are difficult to open or close, bend pages, or fall apart. This is the Ferrari of binders. Avery binders are the best binders ever purchased, they are durable and can withstand some rough use. Some binders include a clear plastic guide so that the label can be easily inserted into the spine section.
