I really like my new iron on label maker and I feel sure that you will, too! Since my iron is labeled only by fabric types, I had to look on the web to see that the specified range of 284-320degrees F corresponded to silk/polyester/wool (about 300), so I set my iron there. The iron on works well for when the kids are running and they lose their name name tags in cars when they get knocked off by seat belts. The iron on labels are really cool. This iron label maker is very easy to use the kit contains pink and blue ribbons to make the labels so you can start doing labels the minute after you put the six AAA batteries on this machine, yes it used a lot of batteries but have the option to purchasePower Adapter for P-touchGreat label maker like all the Epson products I highly recommend it. This doesn't just make iron on labels. The iron on labels that come with the writer are great and iron on easily. Not just an iron on sticker with your name on it, but a stylized selection of fonts and colors to choose from.This kit is also great for crafters. If I overheat with the iron, the label would gets wrinkly and looks kind of ugly. Also, they require a hot iron to adhere well so fabrics that require a cool iron won't work. This is really the perfect iron on label maker for those who quilt or have a need to label clothing.
