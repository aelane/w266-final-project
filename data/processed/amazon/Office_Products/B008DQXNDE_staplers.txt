Swingline makes the greatest staplers on earth. We always seem to lose staplers in our home, so I was glad to be able to review this Swingline Fashion Stapler. I am always loosing staplers off of my desk; they just walk away. I tested both staplers by having them staple multiple sheets of paper together. There are many other staplers out there where less force is needed. If you had one of the smaller Swingline staplers that looked like this one in the past you probably remember that they were a very sturdy, solid chunk of metal.This stapler is not that.It has metal in it but most of it is plastic and I admit to being disappointed when I first hefted it. Their staplers are the best, most dependable, longest lasting sort. But yeah, the staplers do look an awful lot like old time office equipment. It's certainly not like other more colorful staplers I've had that seemed made to fall apart. we've all had the big , bulky staplers that break in less time than the staples loaded into them.The swingline model featured here doesn't appear to be one of them. I own one of those old Swingline staplers myself and there is NO comparison. What's different between this and most other staplers of this class, its simple, it has a youthful look. Swingline is known for their awesome staplers, and this one's no different. I now buy only Swingline staplers because I know that they will work. I get tired of other staplers jamming or being unable to handle more than a few pages at a time. I've used Swingline staplers for many years, and they have worked well for me.This one has a nice decorative color (nice if you are into that sort of thing!
