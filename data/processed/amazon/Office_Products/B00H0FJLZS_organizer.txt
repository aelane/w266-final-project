This organizer is convenient, lightweight and easily collapses up and down if you need to take it off the wall and carry it to a new location. It's a durable organizer. This makes a nice little organizer that I could see being useful in a number of different situations. This organizer is very durable. I LOVE THIS organizer! I generally like this organizer -- it is attractive and colorful.The gray plastic &#34;base&#34; or whatever is very good quality -- tough and durable. It's better if you only plan to use this organizer to keep the folders inside all the time (for example, for commonly used forms, to organize mail, etc. I was happy to see I could open the organizer and hang it on my wall. Perhaps what I like most about this organizer is that it keeps everything neat, but is not at all bulky. A dedicated organizer might be more durable, but this fits the bill, is compact, and can pickup and go as needed. The organizer itself is sturdy, made of material that is tear-proof, and each pocket can probably hold up to 30 &#8211; 35 sheets.
