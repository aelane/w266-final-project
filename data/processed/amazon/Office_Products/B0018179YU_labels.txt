These labels are easy to use, easy to print, easy to peel, and easy to apply.They are standard white, so they blended with my Christmas card envelopes, as well as my business envelopes.Pretty much exactly what you would expect an Avery easy peel return address label to do. these labels are just as described - easy peel.
