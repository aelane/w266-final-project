My wrist and fingers are more nimble than my forearm. I can keep my wrist comfortably resting on the gel and control the screen pointer effortlessly.I don't recommend this for people who set their mouse sensitivity low, or who careen wildly around the screen as gamers do. Because of the wrist pad, slick surface and geometric design in the pad. It is firm enough to keep your wrist from sinking into it - thus exacerbating the problem - and soft enough to keep you coming back to it.And I keep coming back to it. I'd thought about getting a gel wrist pad. The wrist rest is made of a soft plastic, so perspiration should not be absorbed. The wrist rest is fairly comfortable, though if your wrist isn't lined up very well it can be a little uncomfortable.Overall it's a decent mouse pad and better than the cheap flat ones, but it's not really a great product.Those are my thoughts, not yours. The gel wrist rest was very soft, but firm enough to provide proper wrist support; extremely important especially for those who spend a great deal of their time working on a computer. The wrist rest is a little  stiff. And there is a leatherette wrist rest that claims to be anti-microbial.It's the leatherette wrist rest that's giving this four stars instead of five. But the wrist rest is a little overly firm, and I think my wrist would rather have a softer surface. The wrist pad is better than a previous fabric gel pad that I have used. This has already outlasted similar Belkin wrist and mouse pads that I've used. It also has a built-in wrist pad. It lifts your wrist to a comfortable level reducing wrist strain. The wrist rest is firm but does provide comfortable support. The gel wrist pad is a perfect height and firmness for your wrist to rest. The wrist rest looks like black leather, and the mouse pad is a light grey background with a repetitive small dark grey triangle design throughout. The attached wrist pad is made of polyurethane gel encased in a leatherette material. Unfortunately, I prefer my3M Mouse Pad with Gel Wrist Rest, Daisy Design (MW308DS)mainly because the wrist rest isn't as hard as this one is and since I have Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, a softer wrist rest really helps. If you don't have wrist or arm problems then this shouldn't be an issue. 3M Gel Mousepad Wrist RestThis wrist rest is advertised to offer 2 unique features that most mouse pads don't seem to have. The wrist pad was a little stiff on the 3M, but after 2 weeks of usage, it has broken in a little. The comfortable wrist rest has a leather look to it, but doesn't look cheap.One little annoying design flaw -- the edges of this mouse pad curls up on the top and both sides.Overall, a very good quality mouse pad that actually improves my productivity a little bit due to the improved precision in mouse movement. The gel-filled wrist rest is comfortable with is sturdy, smooth leatherette surface. wrist rest works well. The elevated wrist rest relieves all the pressure on your right hand and wrist. The wrist pad has a leather texture is very comfortable. Earlier my wrist and arm used to get tired after a long sitting. The gel wrist rest is exceptional as well, will protect from soreness, and is sturdy. The wrist rest is comfortable, and supports my wrist well. Inevitably, the wrist rest is too high, or looks pretty gross after a few weeks of use.This pad from 3M though, is great. You don't feel like you're putting your wrist on a log of goo wrapped in polyester.And with all of this coming in at a reasonable price, this product is an absolute winner in my book. The gel wrist rest is comfortable and my mouse tracks very accurately and easily on the pad's textured surface. The gel wrist rest as I said before it's comfortable, I used for a while to see if I would get that pain in my wrist but so far so good. The wrist pad is a leatherette material. The wrist rest is gel-filled and is just the right size to not cause wrist discomfort. The3M Compact Mouse Pad with Gel Wrist Rest, Black Leatherette, Antimicrobial  Product Protection  (MW309LE)measures 6.5" long (to the wrist rest), 6.75" at its widest point & tapers down to about 5.75" wide near the gel wrist rest. The wrist rest measures approximately 2" x 5". I couldn't stand the wrist rest on any of them; they were usually too thick for me, too squishy & uncomfortable to use. The wrist rest is comfortable, not too thick, not too hard, not too soft, and supports my wrist perfectly. Inside the leatherette wrist pad is a gel that is extremely comfortable. The wrist rest is also sized correctly so that I get support but its not too bulky. The wrist rest almost feels like leather. The wrist rest is comfortable, but it's not as thick and deep as the one is that I'd salvaged from an old combination mouse pad/sheet easel that had a gel wrist rest built in. I've tried other wrist rests that actually made things worse, but this is just the right height or cushion that I needed.Lastly, the unaddressed concern comes from whether or not the antimicrobial surface really keeps the mouse cleaner or not. The wrist pad is the right height for me and is covered in comfortable leather like fabric. The wrist rest is covered with vinyl instead of fabric, so it is less likely to scrape the skin. However, I don't really need the wrist rest--keep trying it with and without--possibly because my mouse is ergonomic--it's Microsoft. The wrist rest is a little on the hard side--I am not sure what gel in the product description means--but it is comfortable and works.The mouse pad is great. The wrist rest was very comfortable, and though I've never had a problem with wrist fatigue, I'm fairly certain this pad would help to prevent the onset of anything.T
