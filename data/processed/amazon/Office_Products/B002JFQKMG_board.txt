This little dry-erase board works very well. I didn't think this board would make much of an impact on my day to day life, but I was wrong. This dry-erase board has it all! Trying to take it out of it's clip one-handed can bring the white board with it. Be aware, however, that the entire board is relatively small (8.5" x 11", the size of a piece of paper), so if you hang something on it with a magnet, you won't have much room left for writing on it with the dry erase marker.This board comes with two options for hanging, magnets or sticky strips. I haven't tried either one, as I just have the board leaning on my desk. The board is useful, and I will use it, but it is not without defects. The board comes with two magnets and a dry erase marker that is held by a clear clip on the top of the board. I'm also happy with how well the board erases. Overall, this is a handy board to have for a kitchen, teen's room, or dorm room. So was able to affix the board securely with those. The dry-erase board blends beautifully with my steel door. It's a sturdy little board and very attractive; it looks more expensive than it is. This board basically melts into the door from a distance, even with writing on it. This dry-erase board is a good buy for the price. I was able to use it immediately, which meant I immediately ran into this board's biggest flaw: weak magnets. If you want to permanently apply the board, you could skip attaching the magnets and use the sticky squares to attach it to a wall. This dry-erase board is okay, but it looks and feels cheap, and the magnets are useless (they're weak and the board is too small in area to really make good use of them). This dry-erase board is easy to set up and use. If you're going to get a dry-erase board, I would really look elsewhere unless that doesn't bother you. This compact dry-erase board looks nice, thanks to the stainless steel finish.

The board does a pretty OK job with this.

Anything I have to memorize or work out, I can just write out over and over on this board.

This is actually a pretty nice board for the price.
