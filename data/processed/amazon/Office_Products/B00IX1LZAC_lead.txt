The 5mm lead pencil is a nice addition to the pen and they have tucked an eraser under the cap. It is very clunky and hard to extend the lead. The 4 + 1 comes without the lead loaded. The lead is advanced by pulling the pocket clip down a little farther than the normal pencil activation. Advancing the lead is accomplished by putting your thumb on top of the clip once it is in it's lowered and locked position and applying more downward pressure. There is only one single lead inside the multi-pen so you will need to be aware of how to add a new one and that is equally esoteric and unintuitive. It is not obvious how to extend the lead once the pencil tip is extended &#8211; push down harder on the pocket clip until the lead it visible and to the desired length but be careful not to push too hard. Anyway, I REALLY like it - so far.I'm told that loading the lead is a little tricky - you remove the tip to expose the cartridges, then remove the metal end of the pencil cartridge. The lead is sturdy as well.All that said, if you don't like ballpoint pens, you probably won't like this one either. I can't figure out how to express the lead for the pencil portion. I strongly prefer to write with a 0.9mm lead.
