I received this gel pen and a freebie ballpoint pen yesterday. It's a nice retractable gel ink pen. The gel ink flows very smoothly, with no clotting or skipping on the page. Smooth writing 0.7mm gel. These BIC gel pens are nice because the flowing ink looks more classy than a ball-point. For a gel pen, it seems like a rollerball, for comparison. It is also easy to grip and has a refillable gel cartridge. )As mentioned, the gel ink flows easily, therefore it is perfect to keep next to your phone so you don't have to say, "just a minute while I find a pen that works"! One of the better disposable gel pens that I have used. I have used gel pens before that seem to labor a bit at times, maybe when the gel is lacking on the ball point, but these don't do that.The pens come with a bit of rubber cement (I think) on the tip so this has be (easily) removed before writing...which I found out after some embarassing moments!I have to admit that I would like a thicker pen to help with grip, so Bic may want to consider this at some point for those of us who need something a little thicker for utmost comfort. Summary:  Compared to three other retractable gel pens, I'd rank this as tied for #1!I'm a pen junkie - I typically go into meetings with at least 4-5 different pens of various colors as it helps me organize my notes.This pen compares very favorably against thePilot G2 Retractable Gel Ink Roller Ball Pen, Extra Fine Point, Clear Barrel, Black Ink, 12-Count (31002).
