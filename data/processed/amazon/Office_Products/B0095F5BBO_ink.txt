The ink indicator level hardy budged! The Pro 10 also has a red ink in addition to the usual colors as well as a "Chroma Optimizer" that can be tweaked to give varying degrees of gloss (or finish) to your image or simply used on the default auto setting. I don't use non-OEM ink so I can't comment about whether that would work here or not.Speed & NoiseSpeed is nearly identical to Epson, a bit slower with larger images. Not having to swap out the black ink, the ink usage, and the quality of prints is what makes it so. All ink cartridges have a specific position. However, that is almost expected with ten ink cartridges doing the work and the great detail I see in the prints I made.Another great feature is wireless and AirPrint. Replacing all ink tanks will set you back ~$150. 10 Lucia ink cartridges, including three for monochromatic prints to enhance deep black density and expand dynamic range, to produce high quality with a resolution up to 4800 x 2400 dpi. Why full ink cartridges are not included with an $800 printer beats me. The ink droplet size is slightly larger on the Pro-10 (4pl vs 3pl). Canon's Chroma Optimizer (one of the 10 ink cartridges) puts down a finishing layer that smooths the prints out. It comes with 10 ink cartridges, not quite as many as the PIXMA PRO-1, but still enough to give a broad spectrum of colors and definition to grays and blacks. I believe the ink cartridges that come with the printer are a full-size set.In summary, 4.5 stars.The Canon Pro-10 is a remarkable printer, I just can't give it the full 5 stars because of the slowness (at full quality) and lack of a useful screen interface, but any serious photographer is going to love this high-quality printer.

One (the Pro-10) uses a pigment-based ink system; the other (the Pro-100) uses a dye-based ink system.

Let's start with ink cost.

The Pro-10 uses 10 ink cartridges, and a full set of inks here on Amazon runs roughly $150.
