Even though this cartridge is half the price of the printer itself i guess that's brothers way of sucking you  in but the quality is great you dont need to wait for the unit to warm upvery happy! Toner cartridge. This cartridge and the HL-2270DW printer it's in have both proven to be reliable workhorses. I expect that this cartridge will last us at least two years, if not more. Either my cartridge is defective or my printer is defective. I would buy the same cartridge again when this one runs low. I have yet to find a reliable non-Brother cartridge to replace these. I tried a refilled cartridge and that was a huge mistake. The cartridge I got was indeed a genuine Brother cartridge. I was able to change this cartridge with no confusion and no problems. We got the cartridge we ordered very quickly, and it has performed flawlessly since it's been installed (nearly a year now). I've been anticipating needing a new cartridge in my HL2270DW so have been following pricing and availability. It's printing perfectly; the cartridge is...well, a toner cartridge and that's what I wanted and that's what I got. This cartridge is the larger capacity of two cartridges that Brother offers for this printer, but its cost is more economical &#8220;per page&#8221; than the lower capacity cartridge's. I strongly recommend using Brother&#8217;s own cartridge for its quality and for peace of mind.
