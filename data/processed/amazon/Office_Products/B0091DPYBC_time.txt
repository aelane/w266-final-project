I use it all the time and my husband even learned how since it was so easy. It took some time to put the start-up programs and default printer back to the way they were before the Epson software installation.With respect to printer performance, print quality both in black and white and color was good. (This is not every time. I've been a long time fan of Epson products, but then jumped to the HP camp for awhile. I guess it's been a long time since I've had a newer printer. Once upon a time, I had two printers - a basic black and white laser for fast, economy printing (still have that one) and a nice color Canon (that went away with my eldest to college). More encouragingly, it seems to be taking its time going through the ink cartridges. It is well worth the time and effort to get rid of wired printers. At the time of writing this review, the single refills are about on par with other single tanks, around twelve bucks.Print quality. Let me set the time machine to 1985") I imagine it is still a more secure way to transmit sensitive documents over the Internet. At the same time, I wish that Epson made sleeker and more compact units. The most time consuming part of the set-up was installing all of the software.My Toshiba laptop is a bit old and slow and for that matter I am getting that way myself.
