The scanner grabbed all of them in one pass, which was a bad thing, because I wanted it scan each page. This is an excellent scanner - put a pile of papers on and press go - but unfortunately the software needs to be developed and it has no network connectivity. It is almost as fast as my Brother scanner but the software is clunky and reminds me of software from the 90s. I still recommend the scanner due to the high quality and speed, but there are some drawbacks. This is a fast and good scanner. This Epson scanner scans faster than our Scansnaps. Update June 2, 2014:  I've been using this scanner almost 4-months now. I actually have grown to love this scanner more and more. The scanner sensed a change in paper thickness and caused an error.Maximum document size:This scanner specifications say that it has a maximum scanning size of 8.5" x 36". However, the largest I have been able to get the scanner set for in the settings menu is 8.5" x 16.54" (if you input anything between 16.54" and 36", it will default back to 16.54"). If the scanner attempts to scan a receipt longer than the 16.54", it will stop, give the user a warning and you will have to pop open the top to clear the "jam". Would be a good scanner for a small office or home office. This Epson Workforce DS 510 scanner is in the same class as the Fujitsu ScanSnap S1500, so I compared It to my S1500 scanner. Unlike the S1500, this scanner is TWAIN compliant.Setting up the Epson Workforce DS 510 scanner was as simple as sitting up any wired printer. Unpack the scanner, plug it into an outlet, install the software, and plug the USB cable into the computer.Included with the scanner, Vine reviewers also received a Reviewers Tip Sheet, a five page document explaining the features of the scanner and software, as well as setup directions. Like the Fujitsu scanner, you need to open the top for inserting a document. Although this is a two-sided scanner it only scanned the first side of each of the pages. Even though it's a two-sided scanner software is set up by default to scan single-sided at 200 dpi. This scanner is great. scanner but the speed and reliability are far superior.FIRST: Twain! This scanner uses twain where the Fujitsu has its own proprietary communication method making it almost impossible to scan directly into the most popular programs and files. That alone makes it the scanner of choice for me. However, I use my scanner about 20x more than he does, so it also might say something about high use. That is not to say that this scanner is a second rate machine, it is certainly not. The Epson scanner was originally priced only about $10 less than the ix500 when I began writing this review a few weeks ago, but now that price has dropped to about $95 less, which makes this quite a good deal.Hardware----------- Solidly built with thoughtful location of different elements. It doesn't start unless you have the scanner turned on and connected to your machine. If you haven't gone paperless but intend to, I think you'll love having a scanner. I ordered this scanner to do multi-page scanning. What the scanner offers over the other 2 machines is a documents feeder which can handle 26 pages per minute and scan business cards (paper and plastic, as well as pages up to 12 x 36 "I'll be using it to organize and reduce clutter in my office, as well as keep tabs on restaurants I've discovered while traveling (having access to a file in the cloud means they will be at hand when I need them and organized in a way that I can find them!I actually have a big editing project ahead which this will make much easier, but it is useful for those other things as well ;)Where did it lose a star? My HP scanner has much nicer factory software, but then again, it was 2x the price...this same HP software does not come with the lower cost HP scanners.So far, no jams, relatively good pass through speed, and resolution as expected... for most docs 300 dpi has proven successful. I received this scanner for my home office. I wanted a scanner that could scan double sided, and in color if needed and this scanner fit the bill.Installation was straightforward although I felt like the programs were slow to install but that's no big deal in the long run. When the scanner is fully closed it  sits 6&#34; tall, 6&#34; deep and 11 3/4&#34; wide. Although I have a flatbed scanner, I decided to see how it would do with an old color photo that I had printed out a few years back on photo paper. What I like this scanner is that it is fast, it duplexes and it produces nice clean images.What I don't like about the scanner is that it is not wireless and requires a USB connection to operate. The Epson DS-510 Sheet fed scanner is a very capable device for converting documents to digital form. The scanner is supported by both Windows and the Mac.The Epson software suite comes in several pieces, with versions for both the Mac and Windows. While the scanner can be used to scan photographs, Epson recommends not doing it (potentially creasing the image) and I have to agree. The Epson DS-510 is a very good scanner, comparable to higher end non-network models at a significant discount to their pricing. All I've got are Macs and after using this Epson scanner for a few weeks, I prefer my Fujitsu SnapScan built for the Mac. A fast and portable scanner well suited for home office or small business. This is an overall very good scanner that with more Mac attention from Epson, could be much better. I setup the scanner without problems on a Win 8.1 64 bit system. does NOT come bundled with this scanner, not even a limited functionality version. I still don't think I'm using the scanner to its full capacity, but in today's world there should be an easier &#34;plug and play&#34; interface for this scanner. This is a great scanner if you have a lot of documents you want saved as PDF files (or other formats). If you set it up properly the scanner will save a copy locally and simultaneously to your Google Docs account. With the Epson DS-510 scanner and its accompanying software, scans can be performed with the push of one button.Scanner and Document CapturePro SoftwareThe program provides many options for the digital scan that you will receive. You can choose to have the scanner scan both sides of the document, a single side, and have it automatically remove blank pages that are scanned. The scanner looks very similar, the specs are similar, and the software purports to do the same things. Then again, I would not purchase a Neato Desktop scanner for a Small or Medium Sized business, especially if the businesses were document centric or heavy. Removing and setting up the scanner is easy. A flatbed scanner is needed for that application despite the scanner specs of 600dpi and 48 bit color bit depth. However, this scanner will reproduce quality images for business purposes.&#9758;This is not a true network scanner. It is a great scanner for a decent price. For a higher-end scanner such as this one, this accessory should be included as standard.Setup was straightforward. I set the scanner up to scan at 600dpi by default and despite the relatively high resolution, the scanner is fast. The scanner scans both sides of the page (if you want) with just one run through the machine. The Brother scanner required me to find the drivers on their website which was more painful but took less time to install once started.Software use:  Easy to use and intuitive. The last scanner I purchased provided this gratis.What You DO Get:3 different scan options:  Direct via scanner button (program behind it is re-assignable), icon/GUI via Epson Scan, icon/GUI via Document Capture Pro (allows more settings such as rotation, skew correction, resolution).2 non-EPSON programs:  ABBYY FineReader (OCR that creates editable and searchable formats) and NewSoft Presto! Not the most attractive scanner, but it was easy to set up and it gets the job done. The select scanner dialog box included other Epson scanning products that I own (and have owned, but deleted a long time ago), but selecting the GT-S50 or any of my printer/scanner all-in-one devices popped up an incompatibility message.The DS-510 includes the 9.0 version of ABBYY FineReader OCR Software.
