I have used this paper for a number of years. Paper is paper. This paper has a good surface and goes through the printer without &#34;jams&#34;. This is good paper at a reasonable price. This is a bright white paper which is good for general printer needs. The paper is as good as any other with the same weight and brightness numbers. And since I have an HP Printer, I am glad to have paper with HP's endorsement (on the back of the wrapping for this paper, it states that it was actually made by International Paper Company under license of HP). So this paper is made for HP and other quality types of printers, whether HP or another brand.So glad I am using this paper now as in the past, I paid for the generic and cheap types of paper that a brightness of about 88, which is not that good when it is compared to 96 brightness. And the old generic paper cost the same price as this high quality paper.For the cost of this product and the quality, this is in my opinion a BEST BUY! I ordered this paper because I knew it would be a good product since it was from HP. I received the paper in a couple days and this saved me a trip to the store to buy it. The paper is smooth and when printed on it shows results that are great quality. 3/6/12: I just bought paper at Target and it was $5 for 750 sheets. It's paper. I have tried this paper in all four of my printers and it works very well. Well this paper has never jammed in that printer. I think this HP paper has taught my printer to behave itself. The multipurpose Copy paper works well the the printer.My family and I are enjoying both the printer and the paper. If your looking for paper to place in an HP printer for a cheap price this is a good buy. So far this paper doesn't do anything of those things - it provides nice clean prints and I have no reason to complain. Nevertheless, I always fan the paper to make sure that it doesn't jam. After I fan the paper to make sure two pieces of paper aren't stuck to each other, then I place it in my inkjet printer.In addition, this paper can also be used in laser printers, copiers and plain paper fax machine. Moreover, this is excellent paper that avoids ink from smearing as it is printed on the page. HP paper, HP ink, HP printer and HP laptops. Excellent  paper for everyday printing from school work,menus,letters,purchase recites ETC! I do like this paper but I had expectations of better higher quality paper than my stand by PrintWorks Multipurpose Paper which I buy for $4. This HP paper was better but not by much not really worth $6.?? this is great paper for my printer nice white prints great and is easy to work with thank you norm This paper is excellent quality for anything you want to do with your printer. Bought this paper again---perfect thickness as not to thin or thick so jammed paper has never been a issue.

But as paper goes, this is good stuff.

Oh, and nicer-looking than the paper you steal from work.

I use this paper with my inkjet printers; and I can use it to make signs to tape to my front door indicating to delivery people which doorbell to ring!The paper is not expensive for all that you get; and it almost never jams in my printer at home.
