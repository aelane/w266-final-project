There are also clear plastic pockets on the inside, both front and back. There are pockets on the inside covers as well as plastic coverings on the outside so you can insert your own covers and labels. There are two interior plastic pockets, one on the inside of each cover.The hinges work nicely. It also has two pockets on the inside of both the back and front covers. Two pockets are better than one large one as the papers don't sit on top of each other - as one pocket is a bit higher than the other, making it easier to see the contents.I also like the clear pocket on the front of the binder. I like that there are two, tiered, clear pockets on the inside front and back covers. It has dual pockets on each inside cover. It has 4 pockets in all. Inside is two pockets on the inside of each cover. This wouldn't show if you filled the pockets or cover with stuff, but I just don't like it. I just see these very thin clear pockets as being pretty fiddly to try and get anything into.The one finger opening is a very nice touch and a breeze to use. There are also two clear plastic pockets for holding miscellaneous papers on both the front inside and back inside; the top pocket is about five inches higher than the bottom pocket.My binder looked mostly brand new when I opened it out of the packaging, but it did have some grey marks on the inside cover, and the outside front cover was a bit pushed up at the ends due to tight packaging. There are two full-length clear inside pockets on each side of this binder, which is a great idea I haven't seen before.Surprisingly, there is just one opening tab on the bottom and none on the top. Inside is four pockets, two of which are larger and two smaller to hold items you woud want to keep with the binder. Dual pockets can be found inside both the front and back covers.Looks very basic but you can Jazz it up anyway you wish!
