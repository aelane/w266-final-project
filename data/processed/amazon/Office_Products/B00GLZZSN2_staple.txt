I have been using this staple gun primarily for small repairs around the house, including a few dining chairs that needed fixing and an old upholstered bench. This is an amazing staple gun, from loading to using it is simple yet effective! This staple gun is light weight, and really easy to use.To start with, it comes with a nice case, which all good tools should have. This staple gun has the right weight and balance to match the task at hand. The Surebonder drove a staple every time. The staple gun has a male quick connectorNOTE: Arrow mentions to NOT connect this staple gun to a system with a maximum potential air pressure greater than 200 psi.- heavy duty staples that are 1/4&#34;, 5/16&#34;, 3/8&#34;, 1/2&#34;, 17/32&#34; and 9/16&#34;. With the Arrow PT50, you're getting a low-cost staple gun and I am afraid to find out about the durability if I accidentally drop this several feet onto the ground.While I was able to staple fabric (and also tarp) onto wood and for the most part, the staple gun worked and I didn't have many misfires, maybe one or two after going through several hundred 9/16's (note: Arrow staples for the T50 are really inexpensive on Amazon).JUDGMENT CALL:For the most basic of projects, from picture frames, stapling furniture or fastening fabric or vinyl to wood, the PT50 is a really solid inexpensive pneumatic staple gun. So, just make sure you disconnect the staple gun from the compressor before adding any staples.Last and not least, it's important to emphasize that this is not a power stapler, nor is it an electric stapler, the PT50 requires a connection to an compressed air unit.Overall, the Arrow PT50 Pneumatic Staple Gun is a pretty solid staple gun at under $40 that gets the job done for basic projects.Recommended! I liked this staple gun right out of the box. I would recommend this staple gun for anyone needing a nice solidly made tool, both for commercial and home use. It's certainly WAY more powerful than the manual staple gun I was using before.But if you find using a compressor either too noisy or too cumbersome then this isn't for you. In maple the staple was flush. I was interested in how this pneumatic staple gun would perform since I already use various pneumatic finish nailers in my woodworking. Regardless I do like this staple gun so far. What I like about this staple gun is the small handy features and how easy it operates. The staple tray easily slides out by pulling a handy level and is easy to fill. I never thought I'd want a pneumatic staple gun but now that I have it, all I want to do is recover furniture and build little things like boxes, picture frames, etc.. Arrow makes quality staple guns, I have a number of them.This is a much more affordable tool than I had previously thought. Nice staple gun that is great for the for the at home do-it-yourselfer. I've not used a pneumatic staple gun before, although I've used a pneumatic nail gun, so I knew what to expect with this kind of tool. I love the staple gun! This is a great staple gun for any home. I have never owned a pneumatic staple gun before and now I am wondering why I have waited so many years to acquire one.This device works perfectly, uses various lengths of staples (depending upon your application), and is quite easy to operate. I never really thought of a pneumatic staple gun, though. MUCH easier to use than manual, and even works easier and more accurately than my electric staple gun.Seems to be very solidly built in spite of its light weight. I wanted to get this staple gun to try a few projects - mainly upholstery on chairs with a wooden frame and stretching canvas over framework. It punches the staple more deeply into whatever you're attaching and it was easy to regulate the flow of staples. Hubby hadn't purchased a staple gun because he didn't think he'd use it very much.I
