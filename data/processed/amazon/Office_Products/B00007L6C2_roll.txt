Also, the roll is just 50 yards, as opposed to the standard 54.6 yards. Soon I hope, I'm down to the last roll. Even though only one roll of tape shipped, I can say this is typical super tape from the super tape company, 3M. It goes back to the roll untangled. The small roll is easy to use. It comes in the roll dispenser and is really easy to tear by hand.Heavy duty...Not so much...Good for medium duty I would say..I stand by Duck tape for Heavy duty sticking. The roll really is a LOT thinner than the picture seems to show. I recently bought a small roll of this tape and I found it to be great, it is so much easier to package items. It's clear enough that it looks more bluish than yellow on the roll. Just used this roll of tape to package up all my holiday gifts. The roll packaging says 50 yards, though, and I haven't run out of it yet, so maybe it's just my impression which is wrong. It sticks well and it is handy to just be able to grab a small roll of tape without it having to be in a dispenser or having to grab a pair of scissors to cut the tape.
