These boxes are quality made, great for moving as you can label the boxes with the handy marker supplied. I use these boxes for storing personal home items, ceramics, and files. They stack nice, the boxes are sharp, well made.You will get SMALL boxes and Medium, with bubble wrap, tape and marker. The boxes themselves are made well and have pretty solid side walls. :)It never ceases to surprise me how much boxes cost. You get 14 boxes that are decent sized (and small enough to carry around without a lot of difficulty), some protective bubble wrap, tape, and a marker. The boxes are sturdy enough, but I probably wouldn't fill them up with books. These boxes are sturdy and perfectly proportioned, stack without crushing. The boxes are sturdy. The more flimsy less expensive boxes such as sold at a big box home improvement store that we used but dented and damaged in one move depending on the weight and how the boxes were packed (filling every inch of space helps the box not collapse under the weight of other boxes stacked upon it in the moving van). About 2/3 to 3/4 of our boxes were in reusable condition after two moves and were able to be given away to be reused by other people.It is convenient to buy a kit with these items all in one place but most people's items vary and they probably will need more bubble wrap which is a more pricey item. The boxes. The boxes are terrific. A+ on the boxes. The boxes have room to write the contents so you will easily be able to find what you've packed once you move. These are great boxes for moving, Bankers Box brand makes high quality sturdy boxes, and I have had nothing but good quality from their SmoothMove line. Somewhat disappointed there are no larger boxes, or that Banks Box doesn't order larger moving kits. Apparently Amazon routinely double boxes everything including the box all this stuff was packed inside. The boxes were delivered well packaged and were very easy to set up. We used these boxes and bubble wrap for our recent move and they helped IMMENSELY. I used the smaller boxes (marked for use in heavy items) and the bubble wrap to pack up most of my kitchen/dishes. The larger boxes worked great for lighter items like clothing and blankets. The boxes are super easy to assemble. Comparatively, these boxes are about average. The boxes are sturdy, but probably wouldn't be used for multiple moves. I used these boxes for dishes, bathroom supplies, books, and DVDs without any problems. The boxes are sturdy and just the right size (especially the small size) and it was so nice to have both tape and a marker included! There are no large boxes, so you are limited to what you can fit in these boxes, but they are a great size for many things you may find on shelves or in drawers. And having 14 boxes total means you can pack a good amount of items. But I can say these are good sized boxes to get your books (small boxes) and photo albums and knick knacks (medium) packed away with ease. I've worked with cheaper boxes that feel like they'll fall apart and I've used the heavy duty ones. These boxes won't support a full load of textbooks, but will take a reasonable load. Smaller boxes may be used for fragile items and placed in a larger box, or good for storing items in the closet etc. These boxes are not the best for moving. In all, we ended up scrapping only a single lamp.Usually we save our moving boxes&#8230;cut them down, fold them up, and then hand them off to the next person we know who is moving. The boxes are very sturdy. The boxes are average quality, I wouldn't use them for anything really heavy. But if you want sturdy boxes with lids and you don't want to drive around town scrounging up supplies this is a good way to go.The kit includes boxes in two sizes. These moving boxes are made of sturdy cardboard. There are 8 small boxes (16x16x12&#34;) and six medium boxes (18x18x16&#34;), some tape, a pen, and some bubble wrap in the box. The boxes are substantial but the accessories -- not so much. The boxes, bubble wrap and tape are sturdy and well made. I personally like moving boxes with lids and handles. The small boxes hold a lot of stuff but you need to be gentle with them and not stack too many of them together. The boxes that are included are small moving boxes - the kind that are perfect for books and other heavy objects. The boxes are marked with lines for labeling the contents of your package. Overall, the boxes are strong and sturdy. The boxes are stronger than average, ideal for long term use, storage or shipping. The small boxes are perfect for moving books - there are handles on the sides of the boxes and they're small enough that you can't overpack the books. The medium-sized boxes are good for everything else, but these aren't super heavy duty; you'll want to use these boxes for things you're moving by yourself.There's a small amount of bubble wrap (relative to the number of boxes), one roll of tape, and one marker; I can't imagine anyone using this as their complete moving kit unless they were living in a dorm. The Bankers Smooth Moving Kit comes with 8 small boxes 6 Medium Boxes, 4 Rolls Bubble Wrap, 1 Roll Packing Tape and 1 Marker . The smaller boxes are good for entertainment items like cds/dvds etc.Of Course the bubble wrap is handy for every side of moving from wrapping items to stuffing it inside fragile items. You get 14 extra boxes, a few rolls of low-quality bubble wrap, a roll of tape, and a thick black Sharpie. The boxes in this kit are nice sizes and seem fairly sturdy, provided you don't fill them too full. The small boxes have &#34;for heavy items&#34; printed on them. I also recommend testing whether you can stack the boxes one on top of the other after they're packed without having them buckle from the weight.Don't get excited about the amount of bubble wrap in this kit. You do have to put the boxes together, and that is easy to do.

The 16x12x12 boxes are a bit more appropriately sized for the weight of the cardboard, but there is nothing exceptional about them.

You really need strong uniform sized boxes to efficiently stack your boxes after packing them.

The smaller boxes are an excellent size - not too small and not too big.
