One thing to note however, you can now print on both sides of the paper (saving rain forests) but I would recommend you not do this for printouts that are heavily graphic oriented or for photographs as this is still an inkjet and you will get bleed through when a lot of ink is used.Another feature that you may be interested in (although are fairly common nowadays on printers) is the ability for the printer to read the memory card from your camera for instance and edit/crop the picture in the LCD panel before you actually print it. One thing we haven't figured out is how to get it to scan from the screen of the printer and be able to direct which PC the output goes to. Cool thing about paper trays instead of an open paper feed like the HP is that my kids don't just grab paper out for any old project since they can't see it. It seems the only thing my network can find is the FAX driver for the printer and so it wants to send all my print documents to a fax number. The ONLY thing more I could POSSIBLY ask for my printer to do would be to collate copies and staple them for me. This thing installed so well and prints SO fast it is unbelievable. The only thing I wish it had was Bluetooth printing capability. Not sure it's the fastest thing in the world, but it's as fast as my Canon was, and until it got cranky the Canon was a pretty good printer (except for the pink thing).I don't fax so I can't speak to that function.

I've folded that thing up and don't use it at all.

I mean, this thing is massive, and I frankly still don't even know where to put it.

First off, the single best thing about this printer is that it is so easy to install.
