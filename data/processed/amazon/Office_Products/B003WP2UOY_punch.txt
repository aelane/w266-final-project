This is a great 3-hole punch. This punch is pretty light weight and extremely easy to operate. I like this punch, an item we have needed in our home for a long time. I am glad to have this three-hole punch in my home office. We use a 3-hole punch frequently in our business since we have to keep a lot of gov't documents on file. Since receiving this punch it has been run through the gambit daily where it is used in a classroom at a middle school. So far this punch has performed without fail and yes, if something can fail, middle schooled aged student will find the way. My other punch has a rubberized bottom which snaps completely off and allows you to quickly and easy empty the entire chamber. This punch requires you to open a tiny little door and try to shake out the scraps, which end up either getting jammed or falling out all over the place. Pressing down on this punch takes very little effort which is a plus if you plan to do a lot of hole punching. The 3-hold punch I have been using only takes about 4 pages at a time and sometimes does not make a clean punch on one of the holes. This punch is a pleasure to use and seems to go through more paper than the other punches I've owned at home.The only thing I don't like about it is that the guides are fixed, not adjustable. And I'm not really sure one needs a punch to be adjustable for 99% of the potential uses. Prior to receiving this punch I'd have to bring my papers into the office to 3-hole punch them or use the single handheld punch I had a home both of which were an inconvenience. I found this 3-hole punch from PaperPro to be great for smaller, more normal 3 hole punching jobs...too many sheets and it 's too much for it, but as long as it's a decent amount (it calls for 12 sheet capacity), it does just great! Its been hard for me to find a good 3-hole punch in the stores. Nevertheless, the punch works a lot easier than my old 3-hole punch. That means you stand there shaking the punch to get them out. I've never been entirely satisfied by a punch reservoir, though, so I don't think this one is any worse.
