We have used label makers around the house for several years. This label maker is fast and convenient to use. This is a decent label maker at a good price point, and there's a rechargeable Ion battery included with charger.There is also a tape cartridge included so you can get up and started straight away and the ability to create saved templates for later use is a big bonus for the repeat printing of labels.Multi-line capability sets this device apart from a lot of other label makers. This is a pretty nice label maker! I was initially suspicious of just how thin the label film is, but the adhesive sticks well and the surface/printing holds up nicely - so, the verdict is: tough enough, and perfectly adequate for 90% of what you'd need. An average label length for me is ~2"+, so I figure 5 per foot. I have had a Dymo Letra label maker that I've used for several years and while I like my old one, I find that this new and improved label maker works so much easier and is much improved. This is a very solidly constructed label maker. The DYMO LabelManager LM260P electronic label maker has several nice features. You can use three different sized label cassettes in it: " (6MM); 3/8" (9MM); or 1/2 "(12 MM) (the label manager comes with one cassette). You also can save text yourself (the label maker asks if you want to save the text when you manually shut it off) - you can save up to nine labels (you can also insert saved text into new labels). The label maker can be used as a portable unit because it has rechargeable batteries or it may be used plugged into an outlet, your choice. It comes with a starter label cassette for " labels. This is not the old fashioned Dymo label maker with the stiff tape & embossed letters of yesteryear, but sleek & modern. The label maker comes with a 10 foot starter cassette, which was super easy to install. This label printer works well, and is a great deal for the price.There are a few issues that bother me though.1) The keyboard is laid out A-Z instead of in a normal QWERTY layout. There are many similar label printers on the market. This is the first label maker I have had and I find it fun and easy to use. I find this label maker perfect for creating labels for my files and DVDs. DYMO Label Manager LM260P label Printer is a great label maker. I've only owned one label maker before this one, so I haven't done a comprehensive review of all that is out there.But I really love some of the features of this one:- Rechargeable battery- Detailed graphic display to preview the label before printing- 6 different font sizes to print with- Ability to save commonly used labels and recall with "one-touch" button- Can be held in one hand- Printing/cutting wastes very little label tape (others waste a lot!

I've never used a Dymo label maker before.

It isn't heavy at all, and both the label cassette and the battery compartment are easily accessible on the bottom, complete with studs so you can set it safely on a tabletop.For all the buttons, it takes less than five minutes to figure it out.

But, this is a nice label maker.
