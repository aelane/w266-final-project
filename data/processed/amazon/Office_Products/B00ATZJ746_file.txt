These are very cool file folders, but they cost almost 10x as much as a basic manila folder. These file folder pockets serve multiple purposes. They are heavier than most standard file folders and the colors make them stand out from others, something that makes them easy to spot. If you tend to stuff your file folders with thick or heavy documents, I'd recommend buying a very durable standard file folder. They won't fall out like a file folder. If you could design a file folder, this would be it, with the exception that it doesn't actually do the filing for you!This is a folder that can sit horizontally or vertically. Tall file folders have started to trend! I found the Smead Organized UP Heavyweight file folders to be a big help in organizing my work space.I have a desk where there is one deep drawer and I had files laid out on top of one another so that I had to remove the top items to see what was underneath.With these file folders, I could take the six most important areas and break them down so they were easily seen and accessible.I set up files for tax receipts, writing information, health reports, items on my family history and a spare for legal pads and envelopes.The files are sturdy, have assorted colors and can be used vertically or horizontally. This is not just a file folder. I am accustomed to using horizontal file folders, so the vertical orientation of these folders is strange to me. These vertical file folders seem like a fantastic idea-- until you realize they're not going to work in a standard file cabinet, or with hanging file folders.

They're fine when left in a file drawer, but when transferring those folders to a briefcase or messenger bag, the contents can be spilled, spewing papers and documents all over the place when one is in a rush.TheseSmead Organized UP Heavyweight File Folders, Dual Tabs, Letter Size, Assorted Colors, 6 per Pack (75405)are a good solution for this issue.

It's awkward to handle - much more so than with a normal file folder because you have to hold it open and you cannot lay it open flat like a book and have the file protect your papers from the table and any schmutz that might be on it.

I love that you can use these are regular file folders and as upright file folders.The vertical use lets you easliy carry in your back pack or tote bag, and because the folders are closed on one side it keeps you papers from falling out.
