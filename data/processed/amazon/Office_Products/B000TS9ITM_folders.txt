These folders deliver what they promise- a nice, sturdy folder with easily visible tabs. These folders just pop into the drawer, ready to hold and organize my papers. I really enjoy using these folders to keep track of all my financial statements and warranties. I expect these folders to last a long time. These folders seem to be sturdy and the different colors help to organize files more effectively.But frankly, I can't see anything else that would them let stand out of the sea of other folders of the same mold.Yes, you can write or glue a label directly on the folder, without having to fiddle around with those pesky plastic label holders. If you are looking for hanging folders this is the way to go. The folders then disappeared in plain sight. The folders that I currently use require me to fold the edges and inserting a small cardboard insert at the bottom to make the folder expand up to about an inch and the insertion of a tab to label.I love that these pocket folders have not assembly, can expand up to 3.5 inches and the enclosed edges keep the papers from sliding out of the sides. Foremost, these folders are decently priced and are worth their value in my opinion since they are durable and are visually appealing.

It's nice that these folders have tabs that are large [1/3 cut] and are built right into the folder so that you don't have to mess around with those plastic tabs. I haven't purchased hanging folders in a number of years, so one thing that grabbed me when I opened the box was to find indent lines built into the bottom of the folders that allow you to make the base wider, just like on a file folder. I have seen other hanging folders that have a cardboard insert to keep the wider shape at the bottom. If you skip the interior folders or just use 1 or 2 slim interior files, it's perfect. I like the folders themselves. These folders come in great colors. These hanging folders are great, nice colors, very good size, I like the 2-inch expansion you can put a lot of documents and the best you don't need to put plastic tabs, you just handwrite on the tab of these folders and are very convenient. The folders are quite durable as well, and are a convenient size to use to organize bills, letters, papers, homework, assignments, important documents, resumes, or any other kind of writings.

Instead, I hung these folders in my filing cabinet and labeled the included tab and then placed my documents directly into them. These hanging folders are not quite as heavy as my Pendaflex folders, but they are 10% recycled paper. Compared to other hanging file folders I've purchased in the past -- what I truly like about these is the super wide, generous tabs -- One problem I have with my existing file folders is that the tabs invariably fall off, so this is one useful innovation. These hanging folders will really brighten up your desk drawers or file cabinets. With these folders there is no need for the little plastic tabs with the paper insert or having to use a tabbed manilla folder with a label inside the hanging folder. I received my folders free from the Amazon Vine program, in exchange for writing a review of the product.Things I like:- the moss color, which is nicer than the manila or brown ones we've had in the past.- the metal hanging bar is strong and substantial, and glued well to the paper.- the tabs are large, with plenty of room to write.- they are also available in pastel and primary colors, and in "box bottom" folders for thicker files, and also in 8.5 x 11 size.Things I dislike:- The fixed tabs, which are designed to be written on directly. I like my hanging folders to be Howitzer strength, and last for years.Overall, this is a nice product, and priced reasonably at $20.69 for 20 folders. These folders are the sturdiest folders I've ever used. The Smead Hanging Expanding folders are a good quality product that have some advantages and some disadvantages when compared with Pendaflex folders.PROS:Thick detachable cardboard strips are provided to place at the bottom of the folder.

The folders are well constructed and come equipped with built-in tabs in several positions that enable staggered filing.I've used these folders in my home office for several weeks. I've found the folders to be capable of withstanding a good deal of abuse. With traditional hanging folders, papers can frequently be filed incorrectly or lost in the bottom of the cabinet when a paper accidentally slips between two folders. I would have liked these hanging folders better if they had been constructed with more recycled content and came in a variety of colors for additional organizing utility.The product packaging indicates that these folders are assembled in Mexico. These folders appear to be very sturdily wrapped. I have many folders that need more than than, however. These hanging folders are strong enough to hold even blank paper of different sizes, and my planner, when I don't want to have it on the desk, but I need it close at hand. The folders are of a good, sturdy construction and I am very pleased with them. They also come with 20 folders vs. only 18 Smead floders. I, honestly, will never buy the old-style folders.

These folders are a great idea. The folders very durable and made of what seems to be some kind of paper and plastic mixture.
