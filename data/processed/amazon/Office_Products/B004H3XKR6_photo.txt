But I am assuming it is similar to the Canon photo inks as to longevity. I actually like the Epson photo paper though, and we've been using that with an HP Photosmart. So if you're scanning a whole photo album, you can set it just to store the pictures, scan them all in without ever touching the computer at all, then go back to the ones that need fine tuning.-The ink usage seems reasonable. Color photo printing, Epson's fort&eacute; with other hardware, comes out quite nicely here. ON two-sided photo printing (heavily saturated), I printed the less-saturated side first with better luck. What I was printing in photo mode was high-quality invitations on glossy brochure paper and the results were gorgeous!I print almost everything 2-sided if it's multiple pages. The photo has no pop to it.The next issue is the fact the printer does have to paper trays but unfortunately, it does not fail over to the second tray when tray runs out even though I have that option selected in the printer options. Yes, I was pleasantly surprised at the photo quality, given that this is not your typical photo printer. I had Epson's glossy photo paper andthe result was pretty good. If you want a dedicated photo printer, then you might want to aim elsewhere. I loaded a photo on the scanning bed, and selected scan. Printing photo isn't as good as dedicated photo printerSidarta Tanu I have an Epson Stylus 900 photo printer and the quality is fairly close.
