The filer looks like it could hold about 500 sheets of 8.5 X 11 paper, although it would be stuffed at that.Overall, this product seems to be well made and reasonably attractive for the price. This filer solves my problem with the stiff exterior shell and the 5 plastic folders inside. I use this filer for my more important papers that I need during the week but not continuously throughout the day, which means it is not the only filer I need in my bag.Overall, I'm happy with this product but would like it even better if it were a bit easier to access the papers. This filer is made to fit easily into a backpack and it does. Once I used the filer, I found the dividers stayed put, but moved as I needed them to.It's roomy and sturdy - I can see using it for a long time.Worth the price. I can slip this filer into the main compartment and access any papers without dragging the whole thing out--convenient in tight quarters or when travelling. And securing it means the filer has to be pulled almost completely out of the backpack to open it, since the fastener is about three inches from the bottom. I like the filer better for this use than for paperwork. )I like the filer. I was hoping this vertical filer would help. This top-loading filer can hold a lot of weight: 11.4 pounds of magazines. This filer has five plastic folders that are open on two sides. when you insert them into the filer, papers stay inside the folder.

This is a nice durable filer and I really appreciate the removable files as it does improve access to the contents and I can even reorganize the files.

The Wilson Jones filer works well for organizing documents that you need to take on the go.
