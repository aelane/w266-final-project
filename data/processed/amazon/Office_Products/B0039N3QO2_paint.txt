(would remove paint from teh wall if left for more than a couple of days. Our paint did come off, albeit blotchy rather than just sheared down to the primer. But that could just be our really crappy paint job...But there were enough specks of paint on the squares that I just can't see it gripping anything else as securely as the first time around.All in all, I like these easy to use and secure tabs, but I'm not going to buy them for the "reusable" feature...That being said, they do stick better than any of the other reusable adhesives I have tried along the way. They're so sticky they could peel paint when you remove them. You do have to be careful to remove them slowly so as not to peel paint or rip papers but it's worth the extra minute. I don't have any flat paint surfaces on any of the walls in my home, so I wasn't able to replicate those tests.Saving these squares for reuse later was easier said than done. When they are pealed off flat paint, a little bit of the paint can come off. Where the paint doesn't come off, the surface is a little bit different and can be seen. I suspect that the longer they are up, the more the flat paint will be affected.Overall, this is a great product and something I wish was around in my high school and college days. She tapes them up there and then when she wants to change them - it rips the paint off the walls! Was able to move it to straighten it without damaging the paint on the wall. The paint is slightly glossy, but even looking at an angle, I couldn't see anything.
