These Bankers storage boxes, however, do.I found these boxes relatively easy to put together, and the black and white pattern looks really fantastic. Maximizing my storage always makes me happy.These boxes work well and look great, and I would definitely recommend them for storage in areas that are on display. I wouldn't suggest these for storage of anything of value or archival in a garage, basement, attic, etc as the handgrip holes, as well as the sheet of plastic that is not stuck on but rather wedged between cardboard edges (during assembly) may make this box a haven for tiny critters. Or their storage bins in Coffee Linen colour that have nothing but 5 star reviews. Those are nice.Still, if you're looking for storage boxes, don't go for these. You wouldn't want to use them for storage in even remotely damp places or in attics, where spiders and such might go about unchecked. I really love these storage boxes. I generally use good-quality storage boxes (e.g. If you're looking for a sturdy underbed storage system that is more attractive than the rubbermaid style tubs, these are worth a look. ]Currently I have cheap under-bed storage from Target. These storage bins fit perfectly on a closet shelf. These storage boxes comes in unassembled but it is very easy to assemble and it takes no more than a few minutes to assemble each one. They are not suitable for the long-term storage of valuables inside a storage lockup; dust, insects, dampness, etc., will get into them and ruin them. They are excellent, however, for the temporary storage and/or organization of paperwork, such as bank and medical statements, sheet music, schoolwork, etc.I don't have a storage cube organizer. These are great storage boxes. For general storage of papers at home, there are simpler, less expensive, and less flashy alternatives. these are nice storage boxes. These are nice cardboard storage boxes. They are not archival (they don't claim to be) so they are meant for general storage not heirloom fabric, photos, etc.Pros:-They look good; they are not just brown cardboard on the outside.-Plastic window lets you see/remember what is inside.-Store flat so convenient to have on hand.-Fit nicely on closet shelves.-Easy to put together.-Plastic handles are nice & keep the box from tearing.Cons:-Not airtight/dustproof.-Plain old brown cardboard on the inside.-Not a super heavyweight but should be adequate for general storage of lightweight items. These storage boxes are top of the line. I really like these storage boxes. These storage bins for office or school supplies - or for almost anything else you can imagine - are very sturdy for cardboard, and their attractive textured white threads pattern on a cool gray background fits just about any d&eacute;cor. I have some plastic storage bins, but they are opaque blue and so I would have to unstack them and open them up every time I started looking for certain items. However, since we are not really using these for long-term storage, that is not really a big deal. They are very secure though once together.All in all, pretty darn nice storage boxes that I will make good use of. These storage boxes are very functional. These storage boxes have been designed with multiple needs in mind. These storage boxes are especially appealing if you need to keep them in a place where they'll be seen as they are decorated with a damask pattern. They are a little pricier than a standard storage box, so if they are just going to end up in the corner of a garage, the extra features probably aren't necessary. I've put many storage boxes together, usually in a few seconds. The lid went together easily like any other storage box lid. In general it is difficult to get excited over a storage box.

Also, I prefer my storage boxes/bins to be a bit more air tight or dust proof which due to the side handles these are not.

No, these storage boxes are not dustproof, but they are very sturdy and strong and they look nice.

But for upstairs storage these work great.
