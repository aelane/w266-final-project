It doesn't use the typical post it note pack. I haven't tried regular post it's in this device, but I doubt they'd work.Overall, if you need a handy post it dispenser at work, your home office, or in your kitchen, this is a nice one. This post it holder has a spring mounted arm to hold 'pop-up' post-its snugly in place and can dispense them very easily. * No more misplaced post its when you urgently need them! If you are looking for a post it holder that you can hang on the wall then look no further. This post it dispenser makes writing notes and memo's a lot easier because the pen and paper are always in the same spot mounted on the wall. This post it dispenser ONLY uses the Pop Up post it notes so please keep that in mind. That was before all the cool post its came out! I have been using this post it dispenser on my refrigerator.Its great to make quick lists so I just pop in one of these before running to the nearby store or mall.It sticks well. Sure you could store your post it notes in your desk but where's the fun in that. You can grab a post it and just pull and it's there, ready for use.Overall, I definitely recommend getting these and they can be used all around the house and office. I love post it notes, but I can never seem to find one when I need it. It's a little strange how the post it's pull sideways to come out but it seems to work well.

It is aslo easily removable, and can be refilled with any standard post it notes.
