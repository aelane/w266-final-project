)When it comes to stapling, you just press down on the top, like any other stapler, but rather than having to press extra hard, or hit it to go through a large stack of papers, you just keep even pressure and all of a sudden it snaps and the stapling job is done. The Paper Pro II is the smoothest stapler I have ever used. I would highly recommend this stapler to anyone. Very easy once you've done it once)When you push the stapler to it's  limits with thicker and thicker stacks of paper the performance gets erratic - but any stapler has a limit. I pulled this stapler out of its packaging this afternoon and loaded the one strip of staples that came with it. I've previously used a similar stapler from Staples, the office-supply company. As powerful as the stapler from Staples is, it couldn't satisfactorily staple that document. However, this stapler had no problem and produced a good, clean stapling job with well-bent-over staple ends on the back side. This stapler arrived at just the right time. Since this stapler was on it's way, I  hoped that it would arrive in time as she needed to finish it in one day. Updated 6/29/2012: I still like the stapler a lot, but have been noticing a couple of annoying aspects after a lot of use. Well, I've finally found the stapler I'll be sticking with--thePaperPro Generation II Hi-Start Stapler (1460)!One of my old staplers was a PaperPro (thePaperPro Desktop Stapler, Black/Gray (1100)), so I wondered how much better this slightly more expensive version could be. Also, after using this stapler for more than a month, I have never had it jam. I love this stapler, and I highly recommend it. This stapler is really good -- works smoothly and effectively, much better than others I have or have used before. This lightweight stapler requires minimal effort to attach a bigger than average stack of papers. The stapler simplifies the actual action of pushing down to staple. A typical stapler jams when you staple multiple papers together. Compared to the Professional 65 also made by PaperPro this stapler is not as tall so it can fit in a smaller space. You use it either by holding the top and bottom together as you would a smaller stapler or rest it on a desk and push down on the top. This stapler unlike the 65 staples 2 pieces of paper flawlessly. This stapler is meant to be used for a maximum of 28 pages. I didn't think I would be so impressed with a stapler, but really, just a finger works. It's silly but I have to say this is an uber-cool stapler and would buy it again. I have another stapler by PaperPro (a little darling that can handle 65 sheets) and I thought that was an impressive stapler. But this one, which seems little more than your average-duty stapler, is just as awesome. The stapler can handle 25 sheets (I tested it) with very little force. The stapler does require less pressure than your average one and it does stable more pages in one pass. This PaperPro stapler uses plain, standard staples and really CAN staple through a thick stack of paper - EASILY - which surprised me because of its handy, compact size. Wow what a stapler! This is my second Paper Pro stapler. Turn the stapler upside down, drop in the staples and close. Very nice stapler that lives up to the hype. This stapler is GREAT for assembling large packets of papers! This stapler is very good. This is an awesome stapler. Then you find that you cannot go back to the "manual" stapler. With this powerful, 21st Century stapler stapling is a breeze. This stapler not only looks attractive but also works really well by removing the need to pound the stapler in order to get the staple to penetrate many layers of paper. On the stapler it is slightly more specific: "USE STANDARD 26/6 STAPLES". Who would have thought it -- a better stapler. Also important to note, it's an all metal stapler. After using this stapler, I decided to check out their other products and was amazed at the variety of staplers they have. The Power Pro Generation II stapler is a more than adequate stapler for my needs. One cannot read the user manual if it does not exist.Getting to the actual stapler, it can actually do a legit twenty eight pages comfortably. This stapler has harnessed the power of a staple gun for use in a desktop stapler. This stapler is awesome!!! This has been our everyday stapler for the past few months. It does exactly what a stapler is supposed to do: staple the papers together, well. It is a great stapler. If you are looking for a new stapler, don't waste your money on a cheap imitation, spend a little more and get one that will last you a long time. Trust me...what you put into a stapler is what you get. I also hate it when the stapler would miss fire and you have to remove the staples and do it a 2nd or 3rd time.The ease of use and power behind this stapler makes it excellent for the elderly or anyone who does not have strength in their hands. The Paper Pro Generation II is not the cheapest stapler but believe me, this one is worth a small splurge.The only issue? No more slamming down on the stapler to try and staple a thick pack of paper.I love this unit and it has become my go-to stapler. I didn't think a stapler could be this good but just read the other reviews.This stapler is probably the best basic office stapler I have ever used.Strong enough to easily staple 30 pages (I can only imagine they were hedging their bests by saying 28 pages).You don't have to press down super hard to use the stapler, so if you do a lot of stapling at work, as I do, your hand/forearm does not get tired.Also the nice thing is the stapler is not too powerful, meaning if you are stapling two sheet of relatively thin paper (carbon copy paper, thin typing style paper) the stapler will not just punch through the sheets.Not to strong, definitely not weak, this stapler is just right.A rubberized top and bottom so easy to hold in the hand.Also, the stapler is not to big so that if you want to hold it in one hand to do stapling, that is easy to do too.Stapler easily opens up for reloading staples (Of which it hold plenty) and for using it to staple things to walls (Like fliers, pamphlets, posters, small pets and children....don't judge)Anywho, I really have nothing bad to say about this stapler. The Paper Pro II One-Finger 28 Sheet Power stapler does indeed provide necessary staples to bind papers together. It is now my main stapler in my home office and I really like it. This stapler is a nice weight and it looks nice on the desk! Geez, a stapler that made me feel antiquated and dumb.....but, only briefly :)  I pressed down on the tab inside and then I really felt dumb because it was so simple!And, yes, the 'one finger touch' actually works as they say it does when stapling!Remember the really heavy-duty staplers from yesteryear through the mid-80's that are no longer made? The stapler arrived with no instructions on how to load the staples however offered website of instructions. Pull the stapler open as if you were going to use it to staple something to a bulletin board (so that the the top and bottom are in a straight line). The stapler pusher part will open up on its own.
