Simply, this printer is wonderful.I used to believe printers existed only to vex me and my projects. Thankfully, this printer has dismissed this notion. There is honestly no negative to this printer (aside from expensive, future toner refills). It connects to your printer through your wireless network and allows you to print from the app. )Overall, I would highly recommend this printer to any of my friends. I went to "Set-up" on the printer's display, selected "Machine Set-up," selected "Next," Scrolled-down to "Network" and selected "Network," Scrolled down to "Wireless," and selected "Wireless." I "unlocked" my printer selection, and clicked on the "+" button below the list of printers I was able to use to have my computer search for the new printer. This printer fails.To connect over a WiFi network, you must push two buttons-one of the printer and one on the router. I can't fault any of the printer's features.I docked it one star for two reasons:One, it's so ridiculously large and heavy, and I have to wonder if all that weight is justified. I think they could have produced a printer with all the same features but about ten pounds less weight and a few inches shorter in size. It is as fast as the printer, and gets its first page out in about 15 seconds. I like this printer so much that I just bought 3 more for the office. I got this printer to help with my household and small business printing. It's not noisy, and it's a nice looking printer.

I was very excited to get this printer to replace an agingBrother MFC-7820N 5-in-1 Network Monochrome Laser Multifunction Center, one of the very early SOHO network printers available at a modest price.

This printer served me well but definitely had its limitations, mainly its ability to network print.

Though I would not expect this printer to rival or be comparable to the Epson for photos.Duplexing is done by way of placing pages that have one side printed into a tray that feeds them for printing on the other side.
