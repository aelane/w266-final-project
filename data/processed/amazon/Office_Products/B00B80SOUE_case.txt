The case works fairly simply: you twist the lid off, set the lid on the table, and then place the case onto the lid. But it's the pop-up case that what made me all giddy. The case works but could use a better latching mechanism. Since the case is so crowded, it's a bit hard to find the right hole to get a pen back into the case. When the case is open the pens can be displayed and ready to use in the tiered carousel shown in the product photo, but the pop up case can also collapse and the base turns into a cover making it easier to tote the pens around. The case is an extremely convenient storage container with the wonderful option of becoming a cascading display of color. I can't get over the case. The pop-up case took some dings, so I can't rate that super high, but the sheer mass of incredible colors makes up for everything that wasn't exactly perfect.The directions are specific. The case is pretty sturdy and a great to keep track of them all. I especially appreciate the pop-up case, which spins to allow you quick access to all 100 pens. The case works fine when it's level and I will likely leave it that way. - and the case wasn't entirely intuitive at first, with how to pop the stands up in the middle. To use the case as a stand, you take the case's top off, turn it over, and put it on the bottom of the lower half.
