This tape works great. This tape is strong enough to hold but not so store it will pull off the paint when coming down. This tape works as you would expect it to and is priced reasonably.I use tape to tack down a small piece of paper with a person's name to  mark the top of certain jars in the fridge (food allergy issues)... I noticed that this tape often pops off from the cold. I will probably be ordering this tape in the future when I need tape because it is the same quality as what I used to buy but costs less (less than a dollar a roll at the time of the review). The tape doesn't boast this ability so I didn't want to take any stars off for it, but just in case you are looking for this functionality consider this a tale of caution. I will definitely keep using this tape! The tape sticks well but is a bit less transparent than I'm used to. This makes removing the tape after use a bit tricky. First, this tape isn't as sticky as Scotch Brand. Second, my tape wasn't invisible. This Duck-brand tape seems no different from Scotch Magic Tape, the matte tape that you can write on. I ordered this tape, packaging tape, and paper all at the same time. It IS writeable on (though so is Scotch) and the tape goes on and off just as easily. It's not as strong, though, so choose the Scotch tape if you're looking for more &#34;sticking power.&#34; For me a tape should be sticky but not too sticky. A good tape should be able to tape the back flap of the plastic poly bag shut and open up again without difficulty. This is a good tape set. However, if you rub the tape down more firmly with a fingernail, it adheres better and does mostly disappear. It's really a nice, basic tape. This tape seems to work as well as any other light-duty plastic tape. The tape is not quite invisible as the name implies but it is pretty close.

Nice tape.

This tape is really meant for wrapping gifts.

It does not mean the tape is see-thru but it means that when you use the tape with wrapping paper it becomes &#34;invisible&#34; because of the matte finish and has no glossy reflection.
