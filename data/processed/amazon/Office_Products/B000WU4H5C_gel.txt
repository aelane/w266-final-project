Leather-look gel, full-sized keyboard wrist rest.Remove the temporary coating & it will stay just about anywhere... stays where you want it without slipping.Nice to have a wrist-rest that doesn't travel, stays put, looks nice, matches black leather desk/accessories, is very comfortable & goes the full length of a full-sized keyboard, extra for some keyboards.Ergonomic rest keeps wrist at a natural angle & doesn't get bogged down like some wrist rests.3M also has a matching mouse pad that does enhance mouse performance as well.Says it's antimicrobial too, so no worries of keeping germs on there (although you should clean your wrist rests & mouse pads anyhow, it seems they impregnated the pad with an antimicrobial substance, so you can probably just clean with a damp cloth & be fine. This is a gel pad - good.The leatherette surface looks good and, surprisingly, didn't feel sticky even when I used it during a brutally hot and humid day.The non-skid base is NON-SKID. And many gel ones are a bit more comfortable than plastic, but depending on the covering, can become dirty and are often difficult to clean.3M does it right with this product! I feel that the gel in the 3M antimicrobial FABRIC covered wrist rests is a bit too firm, while the non-antimicrobial FABRIC one is more like this one (my preference).One final comment is that 3M puts a very good "sticky" plastic on the bottom. This gel pad is pretty cool, it keeps your wrist confortable while tiping and using your imput devices with your PC.It's reallyconfortable and keeps my hands clean, since i work in a construction enviroment and is a bit dusty.Highly recommended for people that take up more than half an hour a day in front of theyr computer. I bought a cheaper gel version and within 6 months it was already damaged. This gel pad is the exact same length (18") as most OEM, generic PC keyboards and the height/thickness is just right for these plain keyboards. Despite the "gel" in the product description, it feels close to solid, with only the barest give. The gel fillingis, to me, like the baby bear's bed was to Goldilocks - Just right!Additionally, the nature of the covering is said to provide an antibacterial layer of addition protection and while I have no way to test, prove or disprove this claim,it frankly sounds like a good idea to me. I didn't realize just how long this gel rest was. I like that it is anti-bacterial and that the gel is very comfortable to use. The gel is firmer than others I've used but no less comfortable. if you, I would suggest that you consider the gel pads. The 3m gel wrist rest is a little different from the others I have used on a few counts. My first cracked and started oozing gel after a year or so, but that said, the fellows pad has held up for a couple of years now with no sign of it breaking down.whther this will work for you will be determined by the room you have on your desk and the height of your mouse. I've been using a 3M gel wrest mouse pad for the past 10 years and it's still good. The gel texture feels the same as this one. I also think the gel finds a perfect balance between firm and squishiness that works well during long typing sessions.Overall, this wrist rest does the job. The 3M gel wrist pad is a quality product. The gel construction with anti-microbial properties ensures not only comfort but hygiene as well. The gel in this rest has nice firm support and doesn't cave under my wrists. The 3M gel wrist rest I recieved as part of my participation in the Amazon Vine does what it advetises. The gel is nice and supportive under the wrists. It is not as soft as the gel pads covered with knit nylon fabric but it is very durable and the non-stick side keeps it from shifting on the desk. The fabric-covered gel wrist rests are  softer and more "cushiony".The bottom base is plastic and appears to be glued in place, so I wonder how durable this will prove to be over time.The leatherette covering will probably hold up better than a fabric covering would, preventing accidental tears, although it is probably susceptible to scuffing.Overall, it is helpful to prevent wrist fatigue, so it is a worthwhile purchase if you suffer from that affliction.The surface is infused with an antimicrobial agent, which is supposed to help prevent stains and odors from forming and ostensibly protects from surface degradation. The gel is fluid enough that it isn't too stiff on my wrists, but sturdy enough to feel supportive.Honestly, I can't really say much other than this is a nice rest that is worth getting. It is so firm that it doesn't feel like a gel rest at all. They are very thin, and this gel wrest sits too high to work right. This is an extra long gel rest and it certainly is extra long. I have another gel wrist rest for my keyboard - it's squishy and conforms to my hands while also providing enough stability too. I have a gel mousepad and enjoy the feeling on my wrist. Because it uses gel rather than padding, it doesn't flatten over time. gel wrist rests for keyboard use come in many different levels of softness or give.... It isn't one of this squishy gel wrist rests. Just enough gel to support without being too unyielding. It's comfortable to use, and the gel is extremely comforting on your wrist. I've had many gel wrist supports and this one, by far, is my favorite. Because of its gel, the 3M has a slight give as you set your wrists down on it, making it very comfortable to place your wrists on. The gel is firmer than other similar products, but still comfortable. The gel is not rock hard and not pillow soft; it's right in the middle. The gel is firm enough to provide good support but cushy enough for comfort. My previous 3M gel pad had a fabric outer shell that showed dirt and oil and didn't clean up easily.T
