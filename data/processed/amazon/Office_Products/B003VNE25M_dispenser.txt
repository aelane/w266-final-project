The MSRP for this dispenser is around twelve dollars. Adorable dispenser for any fashionista in your life! This Post-it dispenser is cute looks like a real purse and is very easy to use and helpful, is heavy and well made I think this is good because you can take the post-it and this dispenser will not fall you don't have to worried bought that. The pop-up dispenser is a useful idea and it comes with a set of post-its already provided. I gave this dispenser as a gift and was impressed that it's well made and high-quality (i.e. I love this little dispenser. This is not the first Post-It dispenser I've had, but it's the most functional, because the bottom is weighted, allowing the user to pull out a Post-It without the dispenser coming along. For those already suffering from over-crowding, the dispenser can be hung from an attractive hook using its strap! The dispenser arrived and I took it out of the package. Otherwise, the dispenser is plastic, comes with a small pad of Post-Its, and comes ready to use. Plus, the dispenser takes typical 3 X 3 square post it pads and nothing special needs to be bought when it is time for a refill.I would love for it to come in all colors so that you could have one in every room that has a phone!Natalie S. for Amazon Vine The Post-It-Notes Pop-up Purse dispenser is much heavier than I expected. The dispenser is easy to use: just pop the purse open using the latch and the unit comes into two pieces. This little Post It note dispenser is so charming. This dispenser is nicely weighted so pulling off a post-it note is a one-handed procedure. I really like it... now if only they'd come out with a Darth Vader dispenser!

It's a very attractive looking Post-It Note dispenser that will catch anyone's eye - male or female.

However this can be a plus as it ensures the dispenser won't be blown of your desk, but your head or hands will be momentarily sore if it falls on either.The other issue is the cost.
