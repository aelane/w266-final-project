The greeting card says "A Gift for You" and then there is space to write in a message. If you wanted to use the card by itself - without the enclosed white envelopes for the card - you'd need to either use a label on the front or a soft, smudge-free pen that shows up easily on a dark background.They are cute, but not cute enough for me to pay as much for them as I would for a nice greeting card that gives me more room to write a personal note and would potentially be more appealing to the recipient of my gift. The card has slots for holding the giftcard, an area for writing a personal message, and includes a white mailing envelope.While easy to use and are a better solution than dropping a giftcard in a plain evelope, the giftcard should be held in place with tape or rubber cement to prevent the card from slipping out of the slots.CFH It looks just like a card so is hard for anyone to tell it has a giftcard inside. So easy and makes the card more like a gift and not just something you put in an envelope. I folded up the card, put it in the envelope, and addressed it. But then I felt the card (to try to see if I could tell there was a gift card inside), and was pretty sure that since I could feel the gift card, everyone else could too.Since I didn't want to take the chance the gift card would be pilfered, I ended up putting the envelope into a larger padded envelope before mailing. It does make the card mostly hard to detect. However, the card folds over to enclose your gift card, and there's room for you to write your personal message to the recipient. These gift card holders are no different - too thin for me to consider them safe to mail but perfectly fine to hand to the recipient in person as a gift or place within another package for shipment. The card holders are attractive and do the job. First, the card is colorful and attractive. I personally prefer to use a standard card or one of the standard cards they sell which have holders in them. The card has a slot for a giftcard and also a slot where you can insert receipts, for example. The card itself is very sturdy and it is not easy to bend. One card is in read color and features snowflakes. The card did move around a bit in the holder so I'd recommend taping it in there for firmness.
