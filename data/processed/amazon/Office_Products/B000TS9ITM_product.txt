This is a simple product, basically, do these folder match what they say they are, and the answer is: Yes.Just like the item description, these are heavy duty folders with sides that go from fully collapsed to about 3.5 inches expanded. "They're the product I expected:. This product is far too expensive for that apparent lack of quality control; it's a dealbreaker for me. It's hard to tell from the product photos, these Smead hanging pocket files have a light olive color. Excellent product all around. I used this product to get rid of the middle man: the manilla folder. The product is composed of a minimum of 10% recycled content, which is not really praiseworthy. For me, this was not a product that I would rush to the local Office Depot for.

Nice product...the built in tabs are great...no more tabs that pop off in the file cabinet.
