Totally easy to use, and the pages didn't get caught in the printer like I thought they would, being pre-punched. If, like me, you need to print 30 pages on one report, the paper included is not quite enough. Refill pages are available if you need more paper to use with these 4 spirals, and cover sets.If the stack of papers is too thick, it's a bit more tricky to twist the spiral binding into place, but it can be done. Want more than 20 pages? I just lined up the pages and hang the holes over the edge of the table and began to bind from the bottom to the top. And yes, while binding the 20 pages, I had to guide the coils into the hole every 7-8 turns, but so what? You have to make sure all the pages are stacked properly. There are 40 pages and 4 sets of front and back covers, so you just need to print what you need to on those pages, align the holes, and twist on the spiral binding. The pages printed up on my inexpensive HP printer just fine.I also made up a binder for my husband who has type 2 diabetes to keep track of his carbs, sugar and blood glucose readings. I think you could bind up to 20 pages (40 with front/back printing). The Twist and Bind lets me print out about 6 - 8 double-sided pages (the StoryTeller is single sided only) and quickly bind them without using expensive machinery. This is great as you actually can fit 20 pages inside this coil.
