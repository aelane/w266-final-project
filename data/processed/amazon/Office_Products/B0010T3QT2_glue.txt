THe glue is decent.I took off a point because the patterns on envelopes like this one is just not enough to hid the fact that you are mailing a check. Basically, the glue is strong and the lid is perforated and if someone tried to open it to see what's inside, the envelope cannot be resealed. If you don't want to bother with wetting the glue on regular envelopes then this is a good envelope to us. I do feel the glue should be stronger though because the envelope can be opened at the glue point after it has been affixed so it is not perfect. The glue holds much tighter than most self-sealing envelopes.If someone attempts to lift the seal, it tears along pre-split "give" points.Most of us use the mail less than we used to. I rarely have to use USPS but when I do, I dislike having to mess with licking glue and prefer some level of safety so that the contents are not easily visible. The glue seems to be of good quality. The glue on these is not strong enough to prevent reopening. You'd have to get brush-on glue, double-stick tape or something.Overall, a great product-- highly recommended! The glue goes all the way to the edge of the envelope, and it stays secure until it gets to its recipient.I also like that you can't see through these envelopes to see the contents. I wasn't worried about the glue coming unstuck while in transit.I would use these again and recommend them to others, though if you're sending payments or other sensitive documents,  you may want to fold them within another piece of paper. These are fine---no need to lick yucky glue. The glue also seems much more secure and with the security features you can tell if it's been opened, unlike the peel-n-stick variety. I like not having to lick the yucky glue to seal it, they have a peel-off strip and press to seal closure. Although the glue was very sticky and did not allow me to open it without obvious tampering, I would like to have seen a thicker line of glue.The security imprint was not very secure in my opinion.

The strong glue ensures that it is NOT easy to unseal the whole envelope -- but NOWHERE did I see those red letters!!

The glue seems to seal the envelope well and keep it sealed.

It's better than licking the glue on an envelope.
