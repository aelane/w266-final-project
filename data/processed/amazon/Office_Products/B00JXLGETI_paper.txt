I do wish there were two paper trays. The paper tray is a little awkward and even a bit flimsy...the cover for it seems to fall off every time I use it. Once again, if you need dual paper cartridges, the WF-7620 is the way to go but for a single paper cartridge, the Epson WorkForce WF-7610 is the printer to buy!Highly recommended! So don't try to flatten out some wrinkled paper in an attempt to save a fraction of a cent like I did.Overall, a great machine - maybe a bit too much for many home-use applications, but the 13x19 printing is great, the photo quality is great, along with the rest of the features, so if you're looking for a versatile all-in-one, this could handle most homes and small offices. With this one, I'll have to switch in the required paper. Too bad it doesn't have two paper trays for different sized paper. The 7610 is slightly smaller than the 7620 due to having only one paper tray as compared to the two found on the 7620. I can't imagine how  it could be any smaller and still handle the paper size that it does.Why only four stars? Whereas the WF-7620 has two paper trays and holds 500 pages, this one only has one and holds 250 pages. The Epson WorkForce WF-7610 has only half the paper capacity in its trays compared to its more expensive sibling, the Epson WorkForce WF-7620 (250 vs. 500). If you find yourself constantly running out of paper, the extra few dollars for the 7620 will be worth it, but if you print only a couple hundred pages a week, the 7610 may be the better value for you.

There is a paper tray in the front as well as a convienent feeder in the back for envelops or special papers rather than fussing with the front tray.One thing that i'm surprised it doesn't do (as far as I can tell and my research) is no CD/DVD disk printing.

Because it accepts 13&#8221; x 19&#8221; paper, the footprint on your counter is 22&#8221; wide and measures 27&#8221; front to back with the paper trays extended.

Other than the usual paper jams, I am a big fan of these printers.
