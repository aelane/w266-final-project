I LOVE these little whiteboard erasers. I haven't had to use any of the whiteboard fluid to remove stubborn marker (some listing information stays on my board for months, and my other eraser had trouble removing it). And they work on the severely aged and shadowed whiteboard in my public elementary school in Boston. (The whiteboard that is not actually even a whiteboard in the first place, but a section of tub surround from Home Depot purchased because real whiteboards are too expensive.) I've used these 3M whiteboard erasers for nearly 2 months on a daily basis and I can attest to their continuing excellent performance. I have a whiteboard memopad that was destined for the garbage dump before finding these erasers.I'd tried EVERYTHING to get rid of ghosting and leftover remnants of orange, pink, and purple ink on my whiteboard. This whiteboard eraser has made all of my dry marker eraser dreams come true!5 stars. (To be fair, though, the whiteboard had ink on it that was there a couple of months. When I received my 3M Whiteboard Erasers I immediately went to work cleaning off my whiteboard. These whiteboard erasers do a great job and are easy to use. These 3M whiteboard erasers look a lot like the household sponge shaped Mr Clean erasers. Has your whiteboard been visited by some unwelcome marks? A pristine whiteboard again.I used these for my home office whiteboard to remove marks left behind by our children.The erasers are ergonomically shaped for easy gripping. Used this for cleaning off a whiteboard and they work really well. I use my whiteboard all the time, so I figured these would be a great solution for easily cleaning my board without having to use any sprays. I'd rather stick with my standard whiteboard erasers that are less expensive but do the job just fine. I had received a whiteboard from someone to use in my office a while ago but never anything to erase it. I took it with me to church Sunday because our whiteboard is looking very shabby. It also helps to dry the whiteboard or a residue/streaking will be left.I've posted pictures of "before" and "after" (where half the marks were cleaned). this whiteboard eraser worked amazingly well on our larger whiteboard which we purchased from an office supply store. the other whiteboard we have is one that my husband made himself from an old picture frame and dry-erase backing purchased from michaels (it had to fit the slim wall near our telephone). My whiteboard was so filthy I had to wash the eraser when I was done with it. The one I used took off recent whiteboard markings with no problem or effort. These 3M whiteboard erasers work well for recent dry erase marker cleanup. It is convenient to have a whiteboard eraser that does a good cleaning job without requiring cleaning fluid (a bit of water does the trick with these erasers). I ordered the 3M Whiteboard Eraser for Permanent Markers and Whiteboards to use with the whiteboard in my office at work. I've used them on an older whiteboard that has been around for several years that's seen better days and a brand new adhesive style whiteboard that is spread across the cabinets in my cubicle. Dry, they erase fresh whiteboard marker ink, but leave some marks if I use them on month old, dried on ink. I used this on a standard whiteboard with a normal dry erase marker. Even if these 3M whiteboard erasers cleaned equally well as felt erasers, the fact that they can be rinsed thoroughly makes them superior.While I haven't done a side-by-side test, it does seem that less effort is required to remove marker from whiteboard with these erasers than with the traditional felt erasers. I used this on a whiteboard that I owned for a number of years. A normal whiteboard eraser couldn't remove the faint marks, and I wasn't bothered enough to try using chemicals to clean it. I have adopted an old whiteboard in our department that has seen better days. 3M Whiteboard Eraser for Permanent Markers and Whiteboards seems to clean the whiteboard effectively. If you prefer a durable, easy-to-hold, easy-to-use whiteboard eraser, you might invest in this, but if you're watching your wallet, you can stick to damp tissues. My whiteboard was perfect for a testing environment. Even those will stain a whiteboard if left untouched for that long. I can't believe how clean this whiteboard finally is! They erase the whiteboard, about the same as our other erasers. Traditional whiteboard erasers are heavy enough on one side to stay on a narrow maker tray even if bigger than the tray itself. These 3M whiteboard erasers are PERFECT for grad school students! This whiteboard eraser is really just a Mr.Clean Magic Eraser with a blue, foamy 'handle' on the back. We use our whiteboard just once each year to display our menu at a local annual auction. That's pretty good!If you've even used a liquid whiteboard cleaner you're familiar with the odor and mess. Overall great whiteboard eraser and I've been really pleased if 3M's new product lines lately. I thought I was going to have to throw it out until I got these 3M whiteboard erasers. I have a whiteboard that had some residual dry-erase marks on it that my normal erase could not remove.

The whiteboard looked brand-new by the time I finished cleaning it.

Wipe whiteboard with dripping 3MWE.6.

The 3M whiteboard eraser appears to be just a blue sponge glued to the top of a white sponge.
