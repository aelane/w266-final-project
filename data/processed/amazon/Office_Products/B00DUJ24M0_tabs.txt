They are much better than regular tabs because I don't have to write on them. That said, the other tabs with no writing on them I can write on them if I need to. Some of the tabs are labeled: Study, On Test, etc. The tabs are used to mark page is textbooks, they do not rip the pages and come off cleanly. This lets me grab whatever Post-it I need---I use the tabs and flags on book, the grid notes and full adhesive notes to remember Internet sources, and the highlighter on documents.I really like that the kit is a relatively small amount of many products, which is much better for me than buying a pack (usually a multi-pack) of many different products.This would also be a great gift idea for someone starting a new school semester, or for people who like office supplies. I love the various tabs and flags. The tabs and flags were the two main reasons why I got the kit. I just used post-it tabs to mark sections off in one of my books, and I think they look really sharp and neat. It writes smoothly, and the tabs are perfect to leave as a bookmark. The pre-written tabs made it very easy to find exactly what I need to study and mark certain pages in the massive binder that had numbered tabs and no index. There are tabs, flags, flags with arrows, note tabs, grid notes, full adhesive notes, label pads and a yellow highlighter that has a flag note dispenser in it. There are Post-It tabs and flags, notes, label pads, tabs, and a highlighter/ flags (in yellow) combo.
