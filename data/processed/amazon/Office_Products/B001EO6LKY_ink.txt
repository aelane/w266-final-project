I was amazed at how quickly the ink kept running out. I wasn't printing much at all and it was as if the ink just evaporated. No black ink in this, so you will have to buy that separately if you need it. And who would have thought a $15 ink cartridge would turn into a rambling, political statement. This ink is very good, and the fact that it comes in several tanks tends to make it more economical (less wasteful). The Epson ink sells for a reasonable price and until that raise to too high to purchase I will stick with the Epson quality ink.It prints excellent, does not leak and is easy to install. This ink is very high quality and there is no need to order the Epson 98 if you just want to do printing for yourself. I have anEpson Stylus Photo R380 Inkjet Printer, which uses Claria ink cartridges, and I can let the printer sit, unused, for several weeks, and still get perfect printing results without having the run a cleaning cycle on the printer. This makes me believe that the Claria ink cartridges will remain good, when left in the printer for extended periods of time.

Epson claims that this ink, when used in combination with Epson Premium Photo Paper, produces better quality photos than you can get from a photo lab.

What amazes me is how quickly this ink dries, when used on Epson Premium photo paper.

When I tested my HP Vivera ink in the same manner, even the slightest amount of moisture introduced to the prints would cause obvious damage to the images.
