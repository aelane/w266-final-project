The quality is excellent and I've had no problems. Overall, this is a great quality product at a great price. These are high quality pouches, as they become a transparent solid mass. These 3mm Letter Size Swingline Thermal Laminating Pouches are excellent quality providing crystal clear and durable protection for your documents.The pouches have a 0.15&#34; edge on all sides of your 8.5&#34;x11&#34; document and the 3mm thickness is perfect for protecting standard documents using any laminator machine.While they have a bit of a foggy appearance and are very flexible before exposed to heat. But having good quality pouches is important. This same quality did help my laminating projects stay in place a bit better, though. The quality is great and I have never had a single problem. Overall, I am very happy with the quality of this product. However, the quality is very comparable to the 3 mil pouches from AmazonBasics that are less expensive. I used these Swingline Thermal Laminating Pouches with the Scotch TL902 Thermal  Laminator and was very impressed with the quality. They are equivalent in quality while being less expensive.

Nice quality and they work well.

Generally, I think that these are pretty average quality pouches, but the amount of bending or warping you experience depends on your laminator.
