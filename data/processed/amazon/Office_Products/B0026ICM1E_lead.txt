There are also 12 extra lead sticks packed in a small container for easy storage.Will definitely recommend for anyone who uses a pencil  regularly. I am not sure when the lead rotates but, based on my testing this is, indeed, a nice mechanical pencil. She says it writes exceptionally well and has not yet had a broken lead (to her this is the same type of miracle, apparently, as if I all the sudden gave her an Iphone or something). Pencil lead will come out automatically as you write. The lead never broke--and this after logging three work weeks with an average of three hour-long meetings each day. I will add to that the lead remained sharp and produced a fine line, which is what I prefer with pencils and pens.Another thing that sets this apart from most mechanical pencils is that the mechanism seems to produce a different feel when writing. It's solidly built, but does feel very light.The included lead is plenty strong and I haven't had any breakages while writing. Not quire sure what diamond-infused lead might mean (probably just fiddle with the heat treatment to change the crystal structure), but I like it. It is slightly thicker than a typical lead pencil, which is what I prefer. )The LowlightsThe lead mechanism does not retract into the pencil when the lead is retracted, meaning you always have the sharp edge of the mechanism protruding from the bottom of the pencil. If you are like me you don't expect the lead on a pencil or even the tip of a pen to move at all when you write. Once I get the lead started I literally go all day scribbling notes next to my computer and in meetings and I never have to touch it; the lead is just there, at the right length, automatically. And honestly, I think I think I am still on my first lead, and its been two months now since I've begun using it.Going to keep using this pencil! The lead provided is sturdy and the click mechanism is smooth. It has a rotating lead mechanism that resists lead breakage and maintains a continuous sharp point. It's 0.5mm lead provides a nice, thin look to what you've written, and the shape of the pencil is very comforable in the hand. I tend to break the lead in mechanical pencils (I guess I press down to hard) but didn't find that to be a problem with this pencil. 3) Sometimes the lead is so soft and/or defective that it continually breaks below the wood and the pencil is useless.So does this mechanical pencil solve any of my problems while not giving up what I like about pencils over pens? She doodled, looped, drew and wrote with it, without breaking the lead once. The lead can be lengthened or retracted easily. The lead is strong and the loading mechanism reliable. I had to extend the lead further out than normal and press harder than I normally would to break the lead.I have a couple of one-point-off quibbles. I slightly over-advanced the lead in this pencil and in another comparable brand. (1) It comes with "diamond-infused lead," which, the claim is, will resist breaking, and (2) the lead rotates automatically as you're writing so that the point will continuously be sharp. It seems to be, and the lead does seem consistently sharp, but I'm not sure how much of that is wishful thinking on my part.The pencil itself feels good, and it looks modern. The lead is very crisp and doesn't smudge. I have several cheap lead pencils that if I apply any pressure at all the lead quickly snaps. I felt comfortable doing that because the lead wasn't snapping as readily. There are 0.5 mechanical lead pencil refills, including the diamond infused lead,  readily available on Amazon at a reasonable price so I wouldn't consider this pencil to be disposable by any means and it should last for some time. The lead stays sharp so the writing looks just as good as the first time it was used. Extra lead comes with it. I did not find myself twisting the lead over to find the sharpest edge while writing and drawing. It comes with extra lead and 2 extra erasers for very reasonable cost. The lead is super strong. It says that the lead rotates continuously, but I didn't find it the case. The Kuru Toga Engine (the lead rotating mechanism) is enclosed in a clear plastic tube with ribs for a good writing/drawing grip. She is left handed and reports the lead remains sharp, and the marks are dark even with rapid writing. The lead has not broken once for either of us.The starter kit has one mechanical pencil equipped with one lead and one eraser, ten extra diamond infused leads in a plastic container, and two extra erasers. I bet I have to fine them before I run out of lead for the thing. The lead is fine and sharp. Being left handed, when the lead with other pencils would start to get dull I would smear my writing and the paper would be streaked with grey lead. I prefer a soft lead, so I put a Pentel 2B lead in, replacing the hard lead that comes with the pencil, and that works fine. I continually break the lead. And, sure enough, I have yet to break a lead in this pencil. The lead is supposed to be less likely to break, and that has been my experience with this pencil. The lead does not break under normal use. It will advance and rotate the lead so as to provide a more acute edge for more precise writing and does so in a wonderfully invisible way. I love it, but at first I couldn't get the lead to even come out so I wrestled with it, learning it's idiosyncracies until, at last, it truly did "click" and worked as advertised from then on. Once you do this, the lead is automatically fed quite effectively and you can write and write until you have to replace the lead.The `Kuru Toga Engine' is the `new' technology here. We'll see.I am partial to using .5 mm lead, as it's a diameter that can produce a fine line. I don't know if it's the lead, or the way the pencil is engineered or both, but it's actually tough to break off the tip of the lead, even when using lots of pressure when writing. You basically have to wiggle each lead in the chamber to get it all the way in. I'm not sure how you engineer this, or why is wasn't done before, but the lead certainly seems to snap less with this pencil. I haven't broken a lead yet! Which would be very bad since its difficult to advance the lead without the cap. This lead was truly tougher than the normal lead in cheaper brands. The lead doesn't break as easily as with traditional pencils. The lead is strong and produces almost ink-like lines in terms of precision.The barrel of the mechanical pencil is a little on the large side, more like a medium sized fountain pen than a wooden pencil or many of the other mechanical pencils. Specifically, I have been using 0.5 mm lead pencils for drawing fine lines and graphs which was a necessity in math classes when I was in college. The lead isn't too sharp and doesn't cut through the paper like others I've used. The lead will break only if you apply excessive pressure.Highly recommended. It came with extra lead and erasers too, which is a plus. First of all, the lead actually has real diamond dust infused into it. He even says it's hard for him to break the lead on this one. I tried breaking the lead and it was tough to do! The lead does not break 1/10 as much. The lead in this one is perfect as well....writes with nice clear edges but not so narrow that it repeatedly breaks and you end of with a lot of broken lead without much pencil use. Very few lead breaks.Regarding the rotating mechanism, I cannot see or feel it working. The lead is so fine to begin with that I do not see a great advantage.My beef with this mechanical pencil is the plastic clip. The lead advances smoothly, doesn't snap off as easily as many other leads, and writes well. It's not the lead either, I tried it in another pencil and it snapped, so I consider this pencil to be worth the investment. The harder lead does not break as happens in traditional mechanical pencils. I thought maybe I had advanced the lead a bit too far, so for future testing I did side-by-side comparisons with both this new pencil and my old favorite (Zebra M-301), making sure I kept the leads both the same length. Somehow that lead was just magically keeping up with my writing. It glides smoothly, and the lead doesn't snap when you place the pencil down. That lead,however is the difference that makes it a good buy. It only puts enough lead out to write, plus some sort of mechanism in the pencil slowly turns the lead to not only keep the lead continually sharp, but avoid breakages.The pencil grip is also ergonomic with slight ridges to avoid finger fatigue. It has a rotating lead mechanism that resists breakage, in part due to the diamond-infused HB lead which gives added strength, but also is continuously rotating and sharpening the lead.The pencil feels good in the hand and is great looking with its shiny black barrel and clear plastic covering the grey lower third of the pencil. It is always frustrating when the lead keeps breaking when you are writing. Replacing lead is simple. I wasn't able to break the lead under some pretty severe tests.N
