It comes with two magnets, which is awesome! I thought the magnets would be too weak to hold much, but I was wrong. It also comes with 2 magnets so you can notes up as well. The magnets stick well enough and the board isn't industrial strength, but it's not flimsy, either. The magnets are great to put some papers or notes on the white board. The magnets provided are weak, the pen and eraser don't last long. The magnets are a nice addition; they can hold an index card or a few pieces of paper, but unfortunately cannot handle much weight beyond that. The two attached magnets do work well though. The magnets stick to it alright, but I'll be purchasing some rare earth magnets to use on it instead such as the ones I have at home for the fridge, since they stick so much better than the weak magnets that these kinds of boards always seem to ship with. The two magnets that come with the board are useful for hanging paper items, but probably not more than 1-2 sheets of paper thick.There is no bottom ledge or place to store extra markers or an eraser. It also comes with 2 magnets so you can hang pictures, notes, etc. The included magnets are pretty weak. The magnets can only hold small pieces of paper, as they aren&#8217;t that strong, but I don&#8217;t normally use them anyway. Two very strong magnets are included to use as needed, I guess to hold pictures or notes to the white board.Overall, this white board is doing exactly what I want it for. The two magnets it comes with are weak, so you may want to use some of your collection of refrigerator magnets.It comes with a marker which is weakly magnetic, but it's very small and the line it writes with is too fine to be read at a distance, so you'll want to pick up some larger erasable markers. The circular magnets are strong. I would prefer magnets at least twice as strong. However, one of the supplied magnets will hold up a notebook-size sheet of 90 lb.
