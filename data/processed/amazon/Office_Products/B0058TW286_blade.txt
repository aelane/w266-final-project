The blade is super sharp and easily cut multiple layers of paper.There is a large plastic guard that covers the blade and insures there is no contact with the blade. I'm guessing the blade will wear out faster when cutting non-paper objects, but it certainly is still sharp and cuts fine.I do remember previous paper cutters having about the same performance, but they also added some additional bulk. The blade is where this thing excels. It is quite sharp and a curved blade. The blade is sharp and the cut is smooth. The blade is super sharp and it makes very smooth and easy cuts on cardstock. I am sure you can get the blade re-sharpened when needed, making its overall carbon footprint much better than the slide-style trimmers. However, the blade is not sharp enough to cut the paper when it's only slightly over the edge. I'm sure this will wear down the blade even more. The blade feel very sharp, so maybe this is normal. Be careful because the blade is extremely sharp and precise. My blade was perfectly honed and free of any nicks or irregularities.This isn't going to slide around or otherwise move when you're working, a stack of 10-20 pages (it's rated for and will happily slice through more, but I find 10-20 the happy zone for my own management of the stack) even of more substantial stock are no problem for it at all, and result in cuts as clean and accurate as single sheets.

The blade in my copy has a small nick that causes a very small perturbation in the paper cut.

The blade is tight making crisp cuts.

The blade comes with oil on it, so the first several times I cut for testing, the oil would come off on some of the papers.
