These boxes are very easy to put together. I would call these average boxes. Between the two, this one comes in second.It took longer than the Woodgrain boxes to put together. Wonderful boxes to store file folders as well as anything around the house or office. Great boxes with handles. I was running low on boxes, and even though we reuse boxes as much as possible, there comes a time when they are worn out. This makes it easy if I don&#8217;t want to put all the boxes together right away since they are easier to store flat. These boxes definitely are not heavy duty, but I wanted them strictly for long-term storage, of records, in my closet. The boxes are stackable for my purposes, two or three at a time, and they will accommodate either regular or legal files. Right now, those cost the same $20 for 4 boxes, so I recommend buying those instead as long as the pricing stays the same. I'm very impressed with these boxes. I like them better than moving boxes as you can lift the lid or peek through the handles to see what's inside.Well worth the money and better than other ones I've used. The boxes are easy to assemble, have holes punched in the side for handles, and seem sturdy enough to hold plain file folders (NOT hanging file folders--the lid won't fit over those) and sit on a shelf for seven years.If I hadn't just come from my local Office Whatever store about a month ago with sturdy cardboard file storage boxes that were easier to assemble, had no perforations to tear, and were large enough to hold hanging file folders and which had plastic guards to protect the box edge where the folders hang... AND which were $6 cheaper for a 6 pack instead of this 4 pack... if not for all of that, I'd say these boxes were really spiffy.So now I'm working in the Office Whatever boxes, organizing files into manila folders inside hanging file folders, then moving the manila folders into these Bankers Box boxes for storage.These boxes work, for what they are. If you're new to assembling these boxes, keep a spare one to the side with the instructions facing you until you get the hang of it.It also might be a good idea to have scissors or a razor knife handy to cut the perforations a little bit. I find these boxes to be extremely useful for long-term storage of important documents. I've managed to stack two high if they are relatively light, but heavy boxes are best stored without anything on top. These are sturdy boxes, easy to put together, and their contents are easily accessible. It would be difficult to fill these boxes to the point they would be too heavy to carry.

Anyway, Bankers boxes have always been the right size to keep papers and supplies in for classes or grade levels.

I've used similar boxes for years, and this has a couple of issues:1.)

These boxes do exactly what they're advertised to do: nothing more, nothing less.
