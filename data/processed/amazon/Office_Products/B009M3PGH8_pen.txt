This pen is roughly the same price, but has a far better nib and better ink feed, in my experience. This is the first "real" pen I have ever had. :)  This pen has a nice, heavy weight to it that makes it feel substantial and solid in your hand. Closing the pen is also a one handed task that is helped along by a nicely dampened spring assist.Feel - Not bad considering it has a smooth and tapered barrel. I like a pen with heft - this has it. I like a pen which has a large enough barrel to fit into my rather large hand. The pen comes in a box which is nice enough for gifting with the pen, but probably not worth hanging onto after you started writing with it. It's an EXCELLENT pen! Nice pen with classic appeal and a great fine ball point. Because of the pen's heft, the Metropolitan is wonderful to write with--posted (cap on back of pen) or unposted. My favorite pen is the Safari, but I can't say that I feel it's worth $10-15 more, especially without a converter, which makes the Metropolitan a fine deal indeed!From its fit and finish to the little touches (swappable nibs, included converter) and how smoothly it writes, I couldn't be happier with the Pilot Metropolitan--it's a pen that definitely punches well above its weight. This Pilot pen has a nice sleek and smooth finish and writes nicely, the refill is easier to &#34;plug in&#34; than most and generally starts writing straightaway. Cheap pen. I'm not a huge pen collector, but I'm picky about my writing utensils. This pen at first made me wonder if it would be worth it for the money, but after checking it out for a couple months, I can confidently say that it's a great pen for the price. It's become my go-to pen, and I keep it in my briefcase all the time. This is a nice looking pen. So it is a good pen that does exactly what a pen should do, but I just don't like the feel of it all that well. Writing with this has been luxurious - the pen would just slide across the paper unlike the more scratchy feel of my other pens.Unfortunately, while using it for my chemistry lab, it magically disappeared off of my lab notebook when I went to use the bathroom. I got a similar pen to this one and yes, it will be the same review. This pen writes like a far more expensive pen, in my opinion. This pen would make any writer a fine gift! This is a really good pen. This Pilot pen is thicker than the pens used by most people; plus the groove where the pen turns to open and close might be an irritation to hold in your hand. It is a nice looking pen.
