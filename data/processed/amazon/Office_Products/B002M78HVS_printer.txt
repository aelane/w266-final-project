Excellent printer! I would recomment this printer and I will continue to use Canon printers! Great printer at a low price. This is my third Canon printer and will buy another if needed. I found this printer very easy to use and of good quality. This printer was costing me so much in ink that I no longer print a "good photo" until two to three weeks after taking it. You thought that a $79 printer was too good to be true? But, I wanted this printer as a spare for that inevitable day when I'll need a printer for text, billing, and such. This is my 4th non-LaserJet printer, and by far my favorite. This is my 4th Cannon InkJet printer. It's been a remarkably good printer, considering that I purchased it new from Amazon for less than eighty dollars.My only negative comment is that the iP4700 is an ink hog, but I've never owned an inkjet printer that wasn't. When a printer is first turned on, it goes through a series of adjusting which eats up a lot of your ink. I replaced a PIXMA IP3000 which was the best printer I have used in years. This printer takes much longer to start printing than my precious printers. This is the slowest printer I have used in years. I am probably going to return this printer. I am so glad I bought it through Amazon.Update: I have not returned the printer. This printer still hangs up after a print job. I do not recommend this printer for anyone.It is now 3 months and a move later. When I ordered this printer I thought it was a copier to, but my mistake.

I purchased this printer after a lot of research here on Amazon and elsewhere.

This printer is replacing an old Epson Stylus Photo 780 that I've had for years.

I also wanted the newest printer possible, since I've had problems with other devices not updating their drivers, so this printer fit the bill.The Canon printer has been wonderful for me so far.
