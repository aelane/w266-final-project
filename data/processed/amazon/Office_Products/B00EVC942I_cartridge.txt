The cartridge must be inserted big end first (in case you get one and like mine, no instructions were given) and some pressure will be needed and a bit of pushing the cartridge once in so the ink flows. Quite nicely, it also comes with an empty, refillable cartridge. (If you use the refillable cartridge, you squeeze gently on the middle of the cartridge, place the nib in the inkwell, and let go. Once the cartridge is filled with ink you can screw the barrel back together and gently dab off any excess on the nib. Ink cartridge is easy to remove and looks like a standard type refill. If you use the supplied cartridge, push it in firmly. There seems to be a cartridge but I have not idea how to activate this cartridge or if it should be punctured. It's not an ordinary cartridge or pen. It comes with a black cartridge, and I've stayed away from black fountain pen ink because I've had problems with it clogging in the past, but that hasn't been a problem with this pen at all.This pen lives in my bag and goes everywhere with me, and even though it gets treatment that's not exactly gentle, it has never leaked.Some friends noticed me using a fountain pen so of course everyone had to try it. For me, I just have to remember that the cartridge goes in backwards, or so it seems to me after years of handling Waterman refills.I wish the barrel of the pen were a little more slender, but that's just my personal preference, and it has more to do with the way the pen looks than with the way it fits in my hand. I didn't know how to remove the empty refillable cartridge that was already installed.

If you want to skip the cartridge here are your converter steps:Unscrew the pen from the base.Dip the pen (submerge it in ink) into the ink reservoir and squeeze the plunger to suck up the ink.

Using the cartridge, the 7mm was a little too thick for me however when using the converter the lines were more thin similar to a 5mm.Well made pen that will make all your writing better (though this would be helped even more by improving your handwriting in general).Everyone should own at least one fountain pen.

Make sure the cartridge is penetrated &#8211; you can feel it when it is fully inserted &#8211; to allow the ink to flow.Once you have decided on a ink delivery method, the pen is ready to use.The pen provides a good writing experience.
