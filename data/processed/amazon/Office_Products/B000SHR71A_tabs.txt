I am using these tabs to identify my hanging files. So much easier to use than the regular tabs that come with hanging files. These are quite sturdy tabs. Well I love these tabs because it eliminates two of those annoyances. One, these are strong and durable tabs. Receiving these tabs was just the incentive I needed to finally do it. These tabs are thicker than usual tabs, easy to write on and large enough so that I can clearly see what I have written. I put these tabs on the chapter headings for text books which I use in teaching. )2) I find it easier to read what is written on them than when using the typical colored plastic tabs for hanging folders, as you're looking at ink on white, rather than writing on a white tab that you then put in a colored plastic thingie.Not-as-good points:1) The visible area on which you can write is smaller than the typical tabs.2) The colored strip at the top is fairly small and if you're used to using the color of the tab to 'mean something' then since the color on these is more subtle, it won't leap out as much.All in all, they're OK. I've used the little plastic tabs with paper inserts, but these filing tabs are a huge improvement. Instead of directly writing on tabs, I printed text onAvery Easy Peel Return Address Labels for Inkjet Printers, 0.5 x 1.75 Inches, White, Pack of 2000 (08167). These angled tabs are high quality and stick well. These Post-it tabs have a nice pitched angle, so it is very easy to read the tabs and locate what I need. It is not possible to reuse or move the tabs. These great little tabs are handy for a number of reasons. Second, they're adhesive so no more messing around with plastic tabs and finding the right slits/holes to put them into. They look so much better than the little plastic tabs, which I hadn't typed anyway.... So far, I've used these tabs on page protectors in my 3 ring binder and my hanging files in my drawer. These tabs are holding their own! These tabs are quite handy; they have plenty of room to write on them (not a lot-- a word or two-- but it gets the job done as far as labeling). These post-it durable tabs are great, though I don't use them for their intended use. These tabs worked perfectly. The tabs also stay put and don't fall off. You can remove them neatly and easily and then restick 'em, but they won't FALL off on their own.I give FIVE STARS to Post-it Durable tabs. Unlike the typical tabs, these are a thicker plastic with a preformed angle for easier file cabinet visibility. These tabs are a really thin material (likely plastic) with a vellum-type look and feel. These tabs are more substantial than I expected. These tabs can be used to name and/or label files, and when in need of new tabs, one simply has to peel the old tab off and add a new one in its place. These tabs are of above-average thickness which makes them more durable especially when subjected to frequent handling.
