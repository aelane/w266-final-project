Sometimes when removing a label, the cut would not be clean and this part would start coming off, too. This 3M label meets all the requirements:  They run through the laser printer easily, adhere to the envelope readily, print clearly, and stay put. (oh, they do have the label at the top/bottom to provide weight.) This leaves 1/8" of the label extending past the perforated edge, so you can easily grab them off the backing sheet. It's a label, but...3M makes great labels. yeah, it's a label, but it really is a good label. This particular label seems very suitable for regular and No. I love the permanent label and they work well in my printer. I wouldn't hesitate to use 3M label products again. Each label is 1" by 2 5/8". I am very pleased with this label. They are a great label at a great price. What makes a good label?a) White so the printing shows up.b) Sticky enough to stick to the envelope.c) Feeds through the printer and does not get stuck.d) And when you have to hand write on one, the ink doesn't smear.These are great labels. I don't really know what you'd describe as a 'special' label. 3M has been in the label business a long time. Stuck the label on, and tried removing 48 hours later, could peel it off just as easily as when I put it on.Next up were someFujiFilm FinePix A230 12mp Digital Camera - Redwhich I give out for wedding clients to put on tables for guests. 3M made a great permanent label! When I pulled the label off, it took some of thetest paper with it, which indicates very good adhesion. 3M has produced a superior label product in its Laser-compatible permanent adhesive address labels.I use the labels frequently for packages and envelopes and have found that the quick lift-feature makes them extremely easy to use for fast labeling.T
