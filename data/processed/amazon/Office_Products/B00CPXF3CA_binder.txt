This is billed as a heavy-duty binder. The binder rings open and close easily and the vinyl covering looks like it will last quite a while. I've been using this binder to sort and keep track of coupons. Additionally the binder cover and back are nicely constructed and should stand up well over the years with average use. This is an ok binder with round rings set on the backcover rather than the spine. This is a nice binder. Just take that into consideration.The binder is backed by a 1-year performance guaranty. I received this binder today and was not impressed. I don't think this binder is any better than the $1 one I got at the store. I do have to say that this binder doesn't feel especially heavy duty to me. This is a regular 3-ring binder, 1 and half inch size. This is an okay binder, just fine and I like the color, but it is REALLY BASIC and looking at all the different sizes and colors of these Wilson Jones binders it seems to me they are all very overpriced. This is a very nice bright pink 1.5 inch 3 ring binder. I am a binder junkie, I admit it. This binder operates just like those school binders we used years ago. Nice binder. I really needed a strong binder from Wilson Jones, and I have to say when they come up with a good set of school supplies, they really do not tend to let the supply seeker down. Not only is this great as a extra binder for my school supplies, it is just as sturdy as binders that I could find from Staples or Mead without a hefty price. I absolutely suggest that you really give this binder a shot. binder says it holds 220 papers...i got it to fit 221 papers. this binder has been kicked, sat on, stood on, left in the baking sun and is still like brand new. It looks like it is just melted into the binder cover. The Wilson Heavy Duty Binder is a decent binder whose price and name put it in a poor light. The Wilson binder has the standard old fashioned type, and the cover is not attractive enough for professional presentations (portfolios, etc.). Nice, sturdy, built-to-last binder. This binder I will use to try to organize lots of papers I have. Reasonably priced (almost $12 for one binder?). I've been using this binder to store medical bills and I've not had any issues with the binder at all. The binder has held up to repeated opening and closing without any issues. This is a great binder. The binder itself is very good quality. I'm using the binder for laminated crochet patterns that are used often and so far the rings have held without gaps. This is a three ring binder. I think this will be an adequate binder for a school year, but I do not expect that it will last for two years of kid-wear and tear. Time will tell but I'd be surprised if these lasted any longer than any other binder out there. This is a decent basic binder. I received this binder in pink. I would not call this binder any more heavy duty than the ones I bought recently at a warehouse store for about a fourth the price (they only come in white, to be fair, but they have clear pockets on the front so they can be identified).This binder is ok and has the snag free design (the rings have a little protrusion and dimple so that papers do not snag when you turn the pages).

This binder snaps closed quickly with precision.

That being said, it's as good as any other binder you could get, so you can't really go wrong with this one.

1  inch binder with 1 year guarantee:  This binder has a little more integrity in its construction than some of its counterparts.
