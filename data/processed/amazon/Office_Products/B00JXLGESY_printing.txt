Epson Connect provides remote printing from tablets, smartphones, and laptops any where in the world. For nominal printing, I think the bundle price of standard cartridges is still the best value. They all have wifi, fast printing, auto document feeders which hold 35 pages, fax and scan capability to your computer, air print capability so you can print directly from your iPhone or iPad with no additional software -- they just &#34;see&#34; the printer on the network and print directly to it. The double sided printing makes me laugh every time... the paper starts coming out, then ZIP, the printer snatches it back to print on the other side. * Duplex printing, scanning, and copying. Not as seemless as printing from an Apple device, but it works.RESULTS:PRINT - is beautiful and fast. Also having double sided printing is a nice feature to save paper. So that worked fine!The printing function is very fast. Double-sided printing is also very fast. When printing there are very thin white lines that run through the page across the short side about 1.5 inches apart.

Love the double-sided printing though.Next job was a simple three-paged article from the Internet.

And it failed in duplex printing even though the printer properties were set for duplex.I ran three or four print jobs with the article and every single time -- it grabbed chunks of paper.

The double-sided printing functionality, copier, and fax were a bonus.In terms of quality, the photo printing is just as good as the single-purpose Epson photo printer I have but printed faster.
