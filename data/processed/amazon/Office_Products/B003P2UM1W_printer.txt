I have never received a printer that the cables are all stored in a reusable HP zippered accessory bag and the printer is in a LARGE canvas tote bag with handles to slide out of the box with not tugging, pushing or using your feet.The HP printer is a beauty in a sleek high black gloss finish. The printer spit out a test page showing that the printer head had been aligned/calibrated.Now it was time to install the CD. The printer was ready to use.I have many printers in my home since we have a large family with a total of 6 computers/laptops, but this is my first HP printer and I can honestly say this is by far the nicest, fastest and easiest to use printer I possess. All you need to do is have the printer connected to a home network and follow the onscreen LCD instructions. The printer assigns you a unique email address. The HP C410a will automatically be showing as the listed printer to send your projects to.I highly recommended usingHP Premium Photo Paper, glossy (100 sheets, 4 x 6-inch borderless). I wanted a printer that had the capability to do everything should I decide to use all features sometime in the future. I know, I know, what about the printer? The printer does not come with a USB cable (as it wants you to use its wireless feature, which requires a wireless router and internet connection), so you would need to buy this separately if you need one. The printer also has slots for your camera's flash memory cards and a front USB port for digital cameras and removable drives.The actual set-up of the printer was a breeze. Apps available on the printer, such as Disney Online, tabloid, weathernews, websudoku and current event apps allows you to print from the web without a PC. If you want a printer that really does do it all, without the jamming or subpar quality, this is your product. I purchased this printer in February 2011 and was initally excited to have a wireless printer that I could scan with. Once I did that I didn't use the printer for a few months (had a baby) but I figured after the uninstall/reinstall it should be ready to go as I hadn't used the scan function in over 2 months. So then I had to uninstall/reinstall and I contacted HP again and they told me to take the printer back to the store that I had purchased it from over 4 months ago (ha). He never got his printer working wirelessly either.I eventually gave up because my blood pressure was getting way too high! UUUgh.We bought this printer as a Family Christmas present. This printer does 8 pages of monochrome text, 4 pages of color graphics & just over 6 PowerPoint slides per minute & just over 1 4x6 color photos a minute.Stand alone Copier function IssuesI noticed the colors when you use the copy function come out very slightly different than the original, so it's not a 100% match. This printer will not be a good choice if you need to have a copier function that does an exact size match when making copies as they come out ever so slightly smaller than the original. Including having the printer itself be put in a special canvas bag with handles for extra easy removal!++[AUTO-DOCUMENT FEEDER]Got a bunch of tax docs you need to scan and send to your accountant? I turned the printer on, it coached me to get it attached to my WiFi network, and then it informed me that it was checking itself (about six minutes) and then it downloaded updates to its on-board software from HP. This printer has an "energy save" mode that can be turned on or off via the printer's menu settings. However, it appears that the printer will sometimes drop off of the WiFi network when it goes into sleep mode. Except that it often will drop the printer off of your network. It is easy to restore the printer to the network, merely turning it off and then back on generally does the trick. I prefer to have my printer reliably on the network, and I have disabled this mode. Get the printer's IP address from the Properties menu in Windows "Devices and Printers" and type it into your browser: you will get a very nifty web-based menu for the printer. As I prepared to set this printer up I was admittedly anxious because of what I expected. In summary I have to give this printer 5 stars.

HP Photosmart C410a Premium Fax e-All-in-One CQ521A#B1HUpon opening the printer box  I was pleasantly surprised to see the printer enclosed in a carry all bag to make removal a snap.

So, I decided to print directly from the printer.

First let me start by saying that this printer is immaculately packed for easy removal from the box.
