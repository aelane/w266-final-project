I purchased this keyboard last year for my home theater PC.The size is great for using it on your lap.The range on it is also very good. The keyboard seems fine. ***December, 2010 Update***This keyboard is still working well, but like mostly people have mentioned, the trackball has become too loose, although not so loose that it's unusable, just a mild annoyance. I needed a wireless keyboard and pointing device to use with an HTPC in my family room. I had been using a full sized Microsoft keyboard and mouse. The IOGEAR keyboard is the perfect solution. More often I just balance the keyboard in my lap. I highly recommend this keyboard to anyone conserving space and needing an integrated pointing device. I would buy this keyboard again.

Update 8-30-13I've used the keyboard now for a few days and have noticed one point which I'll mention; occasionally the keyboard will seem to stop working but simply moving it around a little will make it work again.

Love this keyboard with the trackball and scroll wheel.

This has become my wireless keyboard of choice, both at home and in my "day job."
