It is a smaller mouse pad - don't expect to glide across 10 inches - so increasing mouse sensitivity is a must to use this. That being said, my optical mouse glides to perfection, unencumbered by the smoothest gliding surface.2: The black gel-filled wrist pad is soft, comfortable, and doesn't feel like a generic gel ball. The Logitech mouse is on the smaller size (although classified as full size) so over the months I've realized that a gel wrist pad would be beneficial in combo with it.Since the Logitech mouse is really excellent I have not noticed this pad improving how well the mouse functions - everything is just as smooth as it was before. Hey, I never cared about mouse pads before - as long as my mouse could track reasonably well, it was good enough for me. This 3M mouse pad is pretty simple, consisting of a plastic, micro-grooved pad that provides excellent tracking and a "built-in" faux leather wrist rest that's excellent - neither too hard nor too soft, and just excellent at the right height for comfort. My mouse reacts better, without skips I was getting from my old mouse pad which was a printed neoprene mouse pad... cute, yet was affecting my mouse, which occasionally would skip off somewhere on the screen & I'd have to move it to find where it was.I don't have that problem any more. The mouse works so much better with this pad. The mouse pad has a nice backing that helps keep the pad in place too. Also, the mouse surface was also of the same material and it had built up deposits of dirt. It's better than my old flat mouse pad. I've used the mouse pad for well over a year and probably would not have the need to replace it had it not been misplaced during a recent office move. I took this to work because I have a Logitech Trackman Wheel mouse at home, which doesn't need a mouse pad. But the new optical mouse I have at work was just begging for a new pad! I've been using the 3M mouse pad for about a week or two and it's comfortable and works well. It really does seem like my mouse is working faster. All that you could ask for in a mouse pad This mouse pad comes with built-in antimicrobial protection to inhibit growth of microorganisms. The mouse pad seems to provide an okay mousing surface. As I switched over to optical, I switched mouse pads or just did not use one at all. I did use a similar 3M mouse pad3M Precise Mousing Surface with 3M Gel Wrist Rest Blue Water Design  8.71 in x 9.21 infor about 4 years so I was interested to compare with this newer version. I love this mouse pad!. I can't comment on that because I use a wired mouse. The mouse pad is also antimicrobial which is really excellent because office surfaces tend to get really germy. This isn't a bad mouse pad by any means, it's antimicrobial, has reasonable space for an average-sized mouse, and it's definitely better than not having a wrist rest at all. The mouse pad is rather humdrum-looking, but it blends with most desks and surroundings if you're more into basic designs. My mouse glides smoothly on the surface and the bottom grips well, but I'm happier with my other pad, so I'll be going back to that. This mouse pad is much easier to use with my wireless mouse than the standard mouse pad that I initially had. So I'm used to  moving the mouse in a certain way,  which the smaller size does not allow me to do.But all in  all I think the wrist rest is a great idea for a mousepad, and we'll see how the size works out. The second is micro-texturing on the mouse pad surface that is supposed to increase wireless mouse battery life by 75%. This 3M mouse pad is replacing a 5-year old Fellowes mouse pad with silicone wrist-rest. The Fellowes mouse pad had a very soft wrist-rest which was great, however, the mouse pad portion was also very soft. Once I started using the 3M mouse pad, the mouse felt a little more accurate on the screen. I usually just used whatever promotional mouse pad that I could get from trade shows. This mouse does give me quite some different experience. What more could you possibly want in a moderately priced mouse pad. It makes it easy to move your mouse on the desktop.

This mouse pad has greatly improved the quality of my life. Economical, ergonomic and fashionable, this mouse pad is an essential part of my home's computer station. It doesn't affect the mouse accuracy in any way, and it let's you know you are approaching the edge of the pad. It's comfortable, and the mouse glides across it well, and I love the idea of an antimicrobial surface. mouse glides easily over pad. However, this 3M mouse pad is a Godsend. Along comes the 3M Mouse Pad and it's a new mouse ball game. This is a really nice mouse pad.The gel wrist rest keeps my wrist at the proper angle to prevent injuries resulting from repetitive strain. My mouse glides smoothly and response is great. It is much softer, even though I don't like the actual mouse pad surface as much as the one on this product. However, if you just want a durable mouse pad for regular surfing, this is the one to get. So, I guess I'll have to either sit up more straight or move the mouse down to the flat cushion beside me. I have another mouse pad with a wrist rest made out of neoprene. The mouse scrolls over it really well, and the gel filled leatherette is very comfortable. This mouse pad is great. I like this mouse pad/writs rest combo, but it has some flaws. First, I need to explain that I am a committed mouse person. It keeps the mouse clean, extending its life. I definitely recommend this mouse pad. Purchased this mouse pad and the pain has ceased. I initially used this mouse pad at home, but soon took it to work where I'm on the computer all day. So I'd have to lift the mouse, move it forward and then move it back again. For sure it allows the mouse glide smoothly. The mouse I'm currently using measures 4.75" long; sometimes the pad needs to be a tiny bit larger for me to work comfortably. I have a smaller, wireless mouse but the battery is dead & I'm out of batteries. Ok, to keep this short, this is a mouse pad. Overall, this is a nice mouse pad that I will be keeping for a long time to come. I don't know yet if it really does save your mouse battery power, I haven't seen a difference yet. It has great mouse traction and the wrist support is good. Have you really looked at your mouse pad lately? Get yourself this nice mouse pad that you can clean and keep around for a while. I even alcohol wiped my mouse, I was so grossed out. I'm giving this mouse pad only four stars because the gel pad just isn't soft enough. Not sure).This particular 3M Antimicrobial mouse pad with gel rest is also supposed to preserve your mouse's battery power. I'm glad I've got this mouse pad and wrist rest combination piece, but I keep debating busting out my old, comfy, thick wrist rest, especially since little things like curling corners bug me, visually.Good product, just not great. I like this mouse pad. The mouse surface itself is textured and the mouse works beautifully. The mouse pad looks nice and the wrist support feels good. Overall, a good mouse pad. It is noticeably better than a standard mouse pad. This is an excellent mouse pad constructed with top-notch material. But here is what I do know:-  The 3M Mouse Pad with Gel Wrist Rest is an attractive mouse pad.-  The non-skid backing is very effective when placed on a clean and dry surface (so the pad won't slide with the mouse).-  The operational width of the "mousing" area is about 8.5 x 6 inches (overall, the desk footprint is about 8.5 x 9 inches).-  The gel pad is comfortable, and supposedly is antimicrobial. I use an optical mouse (Apple). Now, I'm turning my mouse off every night, because it seems to burn through batteries (as in every 2 months, which seems like a long time, until you're working at night and the batteries go, with no new batteries in sight). This mouse pad with wrist rest is comfortable as well as practical. I move my optical mouse slightly and the cursor on my screen moves. I barely have to move my mouse at all.This is one of those products that once you get it you will be wondering why it took you so long to get it. It's very comfortable, makes the mouse easier to use and my wrist is more comfortable at the end of the day. My mouse pad didn't ride up in the sides. It is a pretty attractive mouse pad and I like the antimicrobial angle since my computer gets a lot of use and mouse pads used usually get really visibly dirty. I would recommend this mouse pad, though I am not sure about the riding up issue since I didn't have a problem with it.
