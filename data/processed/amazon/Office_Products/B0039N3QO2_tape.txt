They're not tape, in the conventional sense: There's no sticky residue, they can be rinsed off and reused if they get dirty, with no loss of stickiness, and they even come in a resealable container. No more tape. Since they're reusable, it's great not to have to worry about tape sticking to the wall and destroying the pictures. It is a great alternative to tape or double sided tape. These are pretty cool and a stronger alternative to tape. Better than tape, spray adhesives and glue sticks. The tape tabs really fit the bill. This tape sticks...and sticks...and then sticks again. This Scotch Reusable tape is very good. I didn't want to ruin them with tape, and I didn't want to have little holes in the wall (or in the posters) with thumbtacks.Enter Scotch Reusable Tabs. Much better than double sided tape and extremely handy to have around! then I would still use the Scotch tape instead of creating clutter with one more item. She had been using double-sided tape to post school work and pictures on the wall. The tape, of course, only had one use, so she was going through a lot of it. This tape is great! The tape is washable if it gets dirty, from the wall, fridge, or dropping it, so it can be used over and over.

You can't put tape on the wall, it takes the paint off!

The tape "tabs" are more like "pads"; they are little rubber squares, much thicker than tape and not like double-sided tape.

I've been pretty much underwhelmed with double-sided tape in the past, so I was pleasantly surprised by these reusable tabs.
