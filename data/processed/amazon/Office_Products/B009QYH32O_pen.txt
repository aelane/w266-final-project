I believe this pen will work well for them. I tried this pen on all surfaces i could think of: paper, nylon,plastic, cardboard,linoleum,formica, glossy paper, art paper; it wrote flawlessly on them all. The pen will definitely be ok for an outdoor person, but it is a bit clunky and out of place on a board meeting table, or a lunch meeting with a client in a fancy restaurant. definitely a handy pen you can be sure will write. I was anxious to see if the pen would write on moist paper, so I misted a piece of paper (a shopping list) and tried it out. The pen did not roll smooth enough to consistently write on the surface. I LOVE this pen! I was looking for a large, sturdy pen for use in the kitchen. So, this pen probably has a small market. If you need a pen that is durable and will write no matter what, this is probably for you. It writes like a normal pen, but water won't interfere, nor will gravity. ), but it is still a good, sturdy pen. For most ordinary pen users, not so much. Her favorite pen. I really wanted to like this pen. The pen is too wide in diameter and that makes it slightly unpleasant to hold. Not sure how often that I need a pen that has to write upside down and backwards. If you do, this is your pen. But when I opened the pen up to examine the refill, I was surprised to see a thin, ordinary-looking refill with a "plug" at the top that I assume is part of how they pressurize the ink. It's cheap-feeling enough for you to mistake it for a disposable pen, but at $7 per unit that's a pen I'm going to want to keep track of. Since the pen, including the clip, is all plastic and the spring seems to be quite strong, I am not sure about the longevity of this mechanism. I'm really impressed by this pen. I can no longer recommend this pen. The pen just leaks and it has made a mess out of my work area. I might open the pen first thing in the morning and not close it until later in the day. I have to keep a pen in my pant pocket while I'm working and take it out and put it back constantly. Since the pen is retractable, I don't waste time with an all-to-easy-to-lose pen cap, and the fact that the clip actually retracts the tip means I'm far less likely to throw the pen with the tip still out in my pocket (FYI, the button on top will only bring the tip out). This pen does exactly what the description says it will! Every pen I used would quit after a few letters, due to the angle. This pen is definitely geared for men for the most part, but I don't think I remember any of the men in our office requesting fine point pens. As far as the pen goes, it does do what it says - it will write smoothly on a wet surface (regular ink will almost tear the paper) and it writes upside down and sideways as well as normally. The pen is a little "fat" (not very thin in diameter), but it is not uncomfortable. If you need a pen that writes in weird positions, this may be it. Alas, I am thrilled to have this Down Force Pilot pen in my possession. Until now, I've not been able to do that because I never had a pen with these attributes.Clearly, I love this pen. I will look for this pen when the ink runs dry as I'm quite happy with the performance. This is a bulky ugly plastic pen, very different from the popular sleek sturdy aluminum or brass Fisher Cap-O-Matic "space pens". The Pilot pen does seem to work as advertised. This is a *big* pen. They claim also that the pen can be dropped into water and it will float - I tested this and, indeed, it did float - and wrote afterwards.But I haven't yet been to space and I don't recall any time in my 50 years that I needed to write something over water. I want a pen that feels like there is something in my hand and then writes with a dark, fluid line.The same properties that allow this pen to float make it feel like a thin piece of plastic in your hand. So far, this pen does exactly what it says it will. I have a pen that lives in my backpack, it goes on motorcycle rides and hiking trips, and it's great to always have something to write with...when it works. This Down Force pen intrigued me, and I was interested to see what it could do.We've been testing it now for a few days, and it's amazing how well it works on nearly any surface in any weather. And, once you pick up the pen, you realize that it is very plasticky; it's a super-lightweight plastic that, if you didn't know, would make you think it was a "give away" pen at a barber shop. This is great since it means you will never have an exposed pen in your pocket.The knurling on the grip, however, is also excellent, giving a nice feel that is solid but not irritating.And, for nicer pens, the price is very reasonable.The issue is that it is sort of marketed as a "prestige" pen and styled that way, which belies the very light plasticky feel. Compared to a Fisher pen (some of which can be had for only a few dollars more) it does not look or feel nearly as premium in the hand or in the pocket. It's a great pen with a very fine point.Testing with the pen writing upside down and at angles, it works great. For one, the pen seems a little larger than other pens that can do the job, and a very fine point is a matter of preference, but I see fine point pens as a little more sophisticated than a typical Bic pen, and the design on this pen is a little goofy. To retract the pen, you push on the clip, not on the top of the pen, and the clip is pretty big. This pen does write as advertised. If that's your objective, this pen will perform.For comfort, the grip has no squish to it, like the Dr. This is a bulky pen that promises that its novel pressure pump mechanism will provide smooth ink flow. This pen did everything I asked it to do.T
