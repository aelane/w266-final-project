I'd been looking for a good keyboard tray for ages and was drawing blanks. This is one of the most functional, ergonomic and well built keyboard trays that I have coem across. The keyboard platform may be adjusted for height, for distance from table/desk edge, and for rotation in relation to the edge of the table/desk. It supports the keyboard securely and affords excellent wrist and arm support. Cheap keyboard trays seem to provide temporary relief for some, but properly adjusted to individual needs, this Fellowes Pro Executive Keyboard Tray can actually enable a user to spend long periods in front of a computer without the typical strain one often encounters.But the first trick is to get it installed, and that may take some doing for some people. I use this keyboard tray as a replacement to the slide out draw on our computer desk. It works beautifully as long as we use the standard keyboard that came with the computer.This keyboard tray requires two people to install but the directions are clear. But it is perfect for the standard keyboard. This looks like a very nice keyboard tray, but I was unable to install it.WHAT KIND OF DESK?The description says it fits most desks, but it does not fit mine. My keyboard drawer is at the height I use everyday, so it would be a good approximation of how I'd use the tray.The wrist pad is comfortable. Solidly built adjustable keyboard tray, heavy and would be perfect for anybody using a solid wood desk. You can slide your keyboard out of sight under the desk. My keyboard is not huge, but it is larger than normal, and it fits without any issues.It took about an hour to install on my desk, which is a normal laminate/particle board office desk. A Mac keyboard will! My keyboard (a Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 3000) fits on the keyboard section and my Microsoft Sidewinder Mouse is happy on it's platform.The first thing to note is that this tray is extremely sturdy and all the parts are metal apart from the wrist support so this is designed for long term use and for anyone who uses a computer regularly. A keyboard tray would even make it better, and this product looked ideal.
