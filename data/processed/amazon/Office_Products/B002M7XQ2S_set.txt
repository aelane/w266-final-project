I'm going to pick up another set for the classroom. This set comes with 12 colorful pairs. Great set for schools! I'm getting a set for my house, too, since I'm always misplacing the darn things. I got a set of these WESTCOTT SOFT HANDLE KIDS SCISSORS WITH MICROBAN PROTECTION for a friend of mine who is a first grade teacher, and she just loves them. These are a great set of scissors. Great set. I received this set of a dozen brightly colored scissors and was amazed by the quality and comfort.

I was excited to get this set in part because of the "rack" that they supposedly come with - finally our scissors would have a home.

This is a very nice set of scissors, that would be ideal for the classroom, or for crafty kids and adults.

I bought a set for a daughter-in-law.
