never had aproblem with paper EXCEPT construction paper...you know the cheap kid kind... Also, be careful with porous paper items, as the stickies tend to adhere a little too permanently to the paper after a week or so and can damage it a bit when removed. The paper residue did wash off, and was fine afterward, but what about my precious artwork that my daughter drew for me? The paper now curled back where I peeled the square off.This square adhesive tab is much sturdier than tape, so if you need something to adhere something heavier than a piece of paper to say, a wall, this might be your thing. So often you want to affix a paper or lightweight product like a poster on a wall, and you don't want to use ordinary tape for cosmetic or other reasons. Very handy for sticking paper or other light objects to refrigerators, walls and windows... and you can actually rinse off and reinvigorate when they start to lose their stickiness. These are paper crafts my kids made that are extremely lightweight. It would not come off of the paper at all without ripping the paper. Thus, it was not really reusable and you should expect it to stay attached to paper. you can wash paper that sticks to it off and reuse. Basically they can make every paper or poster work like a removable Post-it note. They hold even quite heavy paper firmly in place, yet can be moved or removed without damaging the wall or losing adhesion. I've tried to reposition them but the paper starts to tear and it threatens to peel the paint off the door.I think I'll take my chances with a piece of much less expensive tape. This seems too sticky for regular paper and not sticky enough for anything of substance. After I took the paper off and put it back on a couple times, I decided to try hanging something heavier on it.

I left each paper stick to many different surfaces for a full week and the results were all the same in the end-they simply don't work.The tabs stick well to plastic and metal refrigerators- very smooth surfaces, for a couple days.

Any less stable paper surface will leave residue as well.These will find a lot of uses - but use with painted walls and  wood, two of the advertised surfaces on the package, are not advised: success there will depend on the paint and substrate  to avoid removing paint and the type of wood to avoid removing wood fibers.

I'm talking about light-weight paper and even using up to 4 stickers per 6x6 inch piece.
