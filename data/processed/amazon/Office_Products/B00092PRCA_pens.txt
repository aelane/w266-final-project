I love fountain pens as they are fun and different. These pens write smooth and consistently, do not skip or clog like some fountain pens. While these pens would do in a pinch, I would rate them higher if the ink was better. I have used many pens like this and these are nice, if you like this type of pen. These pens are colorful and fun. These little pens (disposable) are great to get you through when you feel creative AND it's so cool to give them as gifts and introduce folks who have never touched a fountain pen or who would like to enhance their artwork, something a little different. These pens write so smoothly, it gives the letters an elegant look! I love pens. I love fountain pens. Not THESE fountain pens! I used these pens, which were available at my college book store, for essay type test questions, taking notes, and other writing tasks. These pens work well. These pens are fantastic, I bought this one in particular because they were cheaper, but I hate blue pens and have no use for purple so I really only used the black, defeating the purpose of buying the cheaper pack. The pens write fairly heavily, which is good for a beginner fountain pen user. I have other pens that are scratchy if not used correctly, so this set is a welcome relief. The pens are not particularly attractive - black barrels with silver triangles. The pens have a clear 'window' down one side of the barrel, allowing you to see how much ink is left.The Pilot Varsity are disposable, although I have seen some videos showing how you can refill them (seems like more trouble than it's worth, though). I still love these pens. The pens don't leak, so I can carry them in my pocket and because they cost less than $3 each I can let students use them without worry.I will definitely buy these again.
