However, the plastic is thicker than paper, and perhaps easier to find after a book has been closed. Finally, if you annotate on the plastic in pencil, the writing is erasable, so the sheet is re-usable.Who will use these: students who don't want to deface library (or their own) books. They are basically flexible, see-through plastic with a tab on one end that has adhesive on one side, and can be placed and replaced on various types of paper. Since the plastic is clear, you can even put the part of the tab over a quote of interest and circle the words or quote.Very interesting for note taking.I wish the plastic took pen ink a little better, but, its acceptable.A very durable way to mark a place. The plastic is pretty thick, so even though the adhesive comes off the book cleanly you could easily tear a page if you just pulled the NoteTab off quickly. These wide plastic tabs have a translucent writable surface to jot down a few notes. As durable as the plastic is, it would be a pity for these to stop sticking if moved around.2. The plastic is actually problematic, since they're obviously made to last but are also, well, disposable sticky notes. Again, the plastic. Not sure if the plastic, itself, is recyclable.For certain applications, I'll keep using these nifty notes. One, the plastic appears slightly frosted when held up to the light, yet, once stuck onto a printed page, the text beneath is very legible. Also, the plastic is fairly stiff - on the one hand, this contributes to the durability of the NoteTabs (for instance, the index tabs will not get torn or dog-eared when handling the book they are in). The plastic is frosted so you can write on it.

It is said that plastic makes up about 90 percent of all trash floatingin the world's oceans.

I was able to write on the plastic without smearing.

Moderately thick plastic makes them seemingly durable -- they seem very unlikely to tear or get creased.Cons:1.
