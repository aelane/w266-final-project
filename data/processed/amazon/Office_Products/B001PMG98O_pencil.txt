This pencil sharpener has answered so many prayers. It sharpens an unsharpened pencil in less than 30 seconds. Now, I just put the pencil in and get good results. There's very little wasted pencil and far fewer broken nibs. This is a sturdy,solid pencil sharpener, unlike the 2 that I have returned to the store. Worse still, the pencil wasn't as sharp when it was done. After a pencil or two, even on an unfamiliar sharpener, it is easy enough to gauge doneness. I would rather have a pencil sharpener that at least works very well on regular pencils. I've never used such a powerful pencil sharpener. When this happens, I'm usually able to rotate the pencil, sharpen it again to get a good point. This pencil sharpener works beautifully...does a magnificent job sharpening, and automatically stops (and a light comes on) when the pencil is sharp. I love this pencil sharpener, it works great. When we insert a pencil, the grinding blade sounds like it chops a chunk out of the pencil when starting.This will handle 6 pencil sizes, 3 larger and 2 smaller than standard, the insertion disk has detents and is rotated to position the desired hole size over the sharpening cavity. Why is a good pencil sharpener SO hard to find? And grinding the pencil down to a 3 inch stub. I needed a new pencil sharpener for my classroom and wanted something that could handle 3rd graders using it. I have owned many pencil sharpeners over the years. The pencil shavings canister is the largest I have seen. If you need to sharpen a pencil, it works. But growing up in the #2 pencil using generation, I expected a bit more than I got.

It has a LED that lights when the pencil is sharp, but the sharpener does not stop grinding.

This makes it awkward, and harder to keep the pencil perfectly vertical.

If the pencil is not perfectly vertical, it gets ground off center.
