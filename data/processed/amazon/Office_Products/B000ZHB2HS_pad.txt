This is a good-looking and comfortable pad that supports fine control of a sensitive mouse. It also means I'm happy with a small pad, like this one. This pad is designed for optimal gaming performance! if you are looking for a functional pad, most any pad will do, but if you are looking for optimal performance out of your laser mouse. Then this pad is for you! The pad has some texture on the top that keeps me from sliding the mouse too quickly. This pad has some clear benefits - the wrist pad is nicely done. I gave this pad to my wife who has been unable to find what she considers a suitable pad for her injured wrist. She loves this pad and the comfort that it provides. The pad did slide with the plastic sheet in place so she put a piece of Grip-It shelf liner over the plastic sheet and that solved the sliding problem. The 3M "pad" surface is made up of a rough texture that is much better for the performance of an optical mouse, and draws less current from the batteries. The pad's surface has a nice traction, modern design, and easily wipe-able. I have not had a pad with an arm-rest before and the adjustment is taking some time. It is certainly better than using an old pad that I have used for years ! I've been using this pad for several days now and I like it. The pad also has a very tacky back to it so it stays put, but this also causes it to pick up dust. Overall I'd say this pad is a winner. pad doesn't slide around, stays on desk well. My other pad was super soft and really comfortable, this one is really firm. The pad sticks solidly to the table unless dusty. My last 3M pad just wore out after about 5 years of heavy mousing on it. This pad surface will hold up. What I don't like about this pad, the same as the old one, is that it is not particularly good if you use a mouse for games. The pad is large and the wide, comfortable wrist rest is at just the right angle for me. HOWEVER, with this pad, I get more like 6-7 hours of working life.The other thing I like about this pad is that it is compact (because I do actually take my mousepad with my laptop or netbook!) Before receiving the pad I was concern because I thought the pad looked small but it's not and having a wireless mouse makes it even better. I like that the pad is large enough for me to manipulate my mouse for my two monitors at work. the pad help prevent carpel tunnel, and the surface is perfect for optical mouse. If you think you might need a larger pad, check this one out.3M Mouse Pad with Gel Wrist Rest, Antimicrobial  8-3/4 x 9-1/4Summing up, this compact mousepad inhibits the growth of microorganisms, improves optical mouse performance, and can even  extend the battery life of your wireless mouse. When I read that, I smelled my old pad and it stank like an old sneaker. I'm using this pad right now, with my trackball. I really like that the whole pad and wrist rest are covered in a vinyl the can be quickly cleaned and doesn't hold dust like the fabric ones. The pad has a good texture for fast gaming but is still super easy to clean. The pad may be too small for those who do large scale mouse movements but for the rest of us the shape should accomodate standard use just fine. The pad does curl up slightly, which hopefully will not start impacting moving the mouse, but so far so good. The pad itself is made of hard, slippery plastic with intricate patterns, allowing fast and precise movement. I'm going to let it go to zero on this new pad, and see how long it takes. The pad lays very flat, and stays where you put it with little worry of it getting pushed around out of place during general use. Got to say I love this pad.
