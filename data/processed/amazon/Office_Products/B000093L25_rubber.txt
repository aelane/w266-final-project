I'd call them medium-sized: when pulled taught, each rubber band stretches to about eight inches. If you're looking for rubber bands you definitely need, you'd probably be better off with standard packaging. When I first got this, I started taking rubber bands off and stretching them, and the first half dozen or so broke as soon as they were stretched at all.

Before, I would always have to hunt around for rubber bands. The rubber bands seem pretty average to me - they stretch like I would expect them to stretch - that is, they don't seem to be overly tight or loose - and they feel strong enough.Someone complained about the rubber bands nearer the inside and that they were more fragile. Oh, and if you want to use it for a rubber ball, be aware that it does bounce pretty good and the rubber bands don't come flying off. This happens as the rubber ages and is, perhaps, an argument for buying this at a brick-and-mortar store where you can inspect the quality and make sure it isn't old stock. 1/8" rubber bands in blue, reddish, yellowish, green, and gray-white colors. I like to use rubber bands for a couple of kitchen-related things. Just wrap one rubber band around until it's taut and it will give you a good grip to open them.The nice thing about this ball is that it's small enough to fit in a kitchen junk drawer, yet it's large enough that it won't get lost the way a single rubber band might. While they were doing this, I was able to determine that the rubber bands were of good quality and worked well. This is a fun rubber band ball! A rubber band ball is practical, it's bouncey, it's fun, it's cheap - I love them. I guess I find it hard to love rubber bands.I
