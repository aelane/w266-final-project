My printing needs have declined over the last year or so. The actual printing is very quick, but the time it takes to process your file is almost eternity.Overall: 4/5 stars, this is a relatively LARGE printer. I love the duplex printing. From scanning to printing, I prefer the Epson, mostly due to the fuller feature set of the scanning software. Duplex printing is jam-free, but feels a bit on the slow side. I guess I was just used to it, but now that I have experienced the faster printing of the MX922 I sure don't want to go back to slow printing. Didn't do much printing at all, but of course the larger of the 2 black cartridges showed EMPTY, then it stopped entirely. Does great DVD/CD printing with the ability to copy that media from its scanner. I hardly know it's printing. Scanning and printing is whisper quiet, and all one hears is just the feeding of the paper.The footprint of the Canon PIXMA MX922 is larger than most all-in-one printers and measures approximately 18"w x 15"d x 9"h. It uses 5 ink cartridges, including 2 black. When printing, if the output door isn't open, it will drop down automatically. It was long enough that I cancelled the printing and tried again in case something had gone wrong.

Other printing, however, is quite good -- once the MX922 gets going.One of my favorite Canon features is almost instantaneous printing, even on models that I've connected with WAPs.

This has been one of the most frustrating printing experiences I have had- since getting rid of my HP.

I was particularly thrilled that it supported two-sided printing, something the Epson printers I've used recently did not.
