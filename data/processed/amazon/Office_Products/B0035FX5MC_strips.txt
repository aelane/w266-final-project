They mount with the Command Picture hanging strips. And because they're hung with Command strips, I can easily remove the mounts if needed. The Command strips also remove easily so that if you change your mind you can take it off without damaging your walls or mounting surface.This dispenser makes it easier for me to be organized. While the locking adhesive strips work well, I would've preferred a magnet for the refrigerator. I use similar 3M strips to hang picture frames and they are strong but my fridge needs constant rearranging with new magnets, photos, and kid's art work.The pen holder on it is just ok, but really could've benefited by being deeper. (The included strips are the same ones that 3M sells for hanging pictures on painted drywall without damaging the wall, and I've had good experiences with them generally. Just bend the little strips in half, stick one side to the holder and the other side to the surface it is going on.) Mounting is simple using the Velcro-like Command strips which allow the dispenser to be easily removed from the wall to fill with new Pop-ups. The adhesive strips let you place it just about anywhere. The adhesive strips work fine...no problem there. It comes with two double strips of adhesive strips that have Velcro, so you can pull it off and on the vertical surface easily. And finally, 3M pull-tab adhesive strips are provided that allows you mount this someplace convenient, but remove it if necessary. You stick two strips on the back of the dispenser, two strips on the wall, let them "cure" for an hour and then mount the dispenser. I don't believe the strips are re-usable, so to mount the dispenser elsewhere you'd need to buy some more.The 3 inch by 3 inch Post-Its are non-standard and designed for use in this dispenser. Two of these strips attach to the back of the dispenser and 2 attach to the surface of where the dispenser will hang. The strips have a non-adhesive tail/pad to make it easy to remove the strip if you want to relocate the dispenser.My husband and I have different work schedules - so we often leave notes behind for each other. The little strips are not real obvious at first.
