The ink dried quickly and clear, as well. I haven't seen an ink jet printer fail standard black and white text in a very long time.Scanning was another story. The ink cartridges are mini-sized. I'd recommend it highly to those looking for a mid-priced ink jet with scanning capability. It said the black ink was low, I replaced it, it said the pink ink was low, I replaced it, then no matter how many times I turned it off and back on, it would only make mechanical noises followed by a message "Printer error; turn off and on." Engineered with award-winning MicroPiezo ink jet technology, this powerful performer boasts print speeds of 15 ISO ppm (black) and 7.2 ISO ppm (color). There is also multiple ink cartridges, with a separate cartridge for each color, which I really like because you can keep printing even when one color gets low. Some of the ink is used for the initial priming operation, though. The ink is nice and heavy and the color looks great.Double sided printing was the big seller for me.

No ink bleeding like my last printer, even if air humidity is high.-Quick drying, I can touch and stack documents fresh out of the printer with zero smudging.-The display adjusts angle for easy viewing whether the printer is eye-level or waist level.-Individual print cartridges, don't seem too expensive, and don't seem to drain that quickly.Cons:-Software install.

Oh and there is no special ink cartridges to buy to get high quality photo printing, the Epson cartridges are meant for photo or document printing.

With the ink thee are individual ink cartridges (one black and three colors) which I used to think it a pain but now realize I can save money because I only have to replace the color I need.My husband's favorite feature on this printer is automatic two-sided printing.
