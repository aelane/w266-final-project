I liked the leatherette comfort very much and the fact the leatherette did not attract all sorts of debris, the firmness was a plus as well. This one is leatherette. The leatherette material is tough, but soft. The leatherette, anti-microbial cover is very comfortable. The leatherette feels much better to me than the neoprene wetsuit material that other wrist protectors use, but if you are someone who sweats a lot, you may want to look into one of those. While the 3m leatherette pad may look nice on a desk it is not as comfortabel as the fellows pad and does not do as well in terms of reducing fatige, or joint pain. So this is good to have a leatherette that can be wiped down now and then, rather than a stretch knit cover, which is how some gel supports are covered. I prefer this leatherette for cleaning, though I like the feel of gel-under-fabric better for comfort.The wrist pad has a membrane you peel off the first time you use it. The leatherette is easy to wash or give it a quick squirt of even hand sanitizer. It looks polished and elegant with the leatherette surface, it's super comfortable, and, at 3/4" high x just under 3" wide, and 19 inches long, it's a great size for just about any standard keyboard out there. The leatherette also got pretty warm for my left hand which doesn't move as much as my right. So the leatherette, antimicrobial features of this wrist rest really appealed to me.I have now been using this product for about 2 weeks. The leatherette is very soft and the pad itself is very comfortable the moment you put it to use. I find that the leatherette finish on the 3M is more comfortable than a plastic feeling.

The "leatherette" (flashback to Naugahyde!)

The leatherette texture feels nice, and the gel has just the right amount of give to it.The bottom of the wrist rest is very tacky; you can't slide it around your desk, you will need to pick it up and move it.

I like this leatherette gel wrist rest more than the cloth covered kind.
