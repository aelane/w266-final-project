The HP Photosmart is our new printer of choice. I love this printer. Great printer with awesome features. Overall, the printer is great. So, I figured I will give this printer a try.Setup was easy but I had to reinstall the software twice because my computer didn't recognize it the first time.But after that, the printer worked like a charm. This one is stationary, and if you have the printer up high, you can't read the display. This is a great all-in-one printer from the folks at HP, I found this printer easy to set up, this coming ftom a person who is no computer expert! So far so good with this printer. The LCD on the printer also walks you through setting up the printer, inserting the ink cartridges, and loading paper. The printer has a touchscreen LCD, so I thought the ability to configure wireless via the touchscreen was included. The printer comes with a six foot USB cable and a 100ct pack of 4X6 HP Advanced glossy photo paper. The printer uses 564/564XL ink cartridges which don't tend to last too long, especially if you print heavy. Installing the printer on additional PC's is a simple process after the initial printer setup is completed. I'm replacing another HP printer, which worked for a couple years, before crashing. This is a beautiful and compact printer. The printer has a glossy shine to it, which is, unfortunately, a dust collector.
