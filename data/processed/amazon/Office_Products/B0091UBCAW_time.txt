In the mean time I will have my old Canon printer repaired and use the Epson only for scanning and copying. I didn't have to do that this time. I got exactly what was advertised in the time promised and it was even better than the various reviews and write-ups I have found on the web. As of this time in electronics anyway...This unit does have a FAX built in but I really don't use one these days since most everyone can use Email with documents attached. Perhaps it's used more than I know but can't remember last time I need to FAX. While I didn't time exactly how long the setup took, the printer came out of the box quickly, unwrapped in a snap and connected to my wireless network to start printing in less than 15 minutes. Every time these cartridges are replaced, it's like you get a new printer. It can take a long time to "wake up" again if it hasn't been used in a while, though.The color seems very good -- there are 4 color cartridges, CMYK-style. It probably takes more time to remove all of the packing tape than any other step. How long does it last?Well, I can't answer the fourth one, but the total time out of the box, review the quick instructions, do the downloading, connect to wifi, and register the product was 30 painless minutes. It just looks cheap.Since The 545 was at some time less $ than this, I'd say check the pricing and see if it's come back down.Also - on a mac, the 545 just worked. The time it takes using Apple Inc. products/system (laptop, iPhone, iPad), is far better (time & quality) than the wired PC/Windows systems used at school.Scanning Steps - Simple & Effective (via MacBookPro)* System Preferences* Print Scan & Print* Select Scan* Select Open Scanner* Select flatbed or document feeder (scanning several pages continuously)* Choose color & other custom output choices* Choose format (PDF, JPEG, GiF, etc.
