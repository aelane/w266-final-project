My last Epson printer worked for me for at least five years, but lately began to have color and streaking issues, so I was in need of a replacement. I'm so glad I did replace it because the Epson Artisan 730 is literally the best printer I've ever owned!First, the setup. Because of the printer's Wi-Fi capabilities, it recognized my home network right away. Plus, the printer knew I was printing a photo, so therefore automatically chose photo paper! The printer is fast, and the quality is excellent. So, it does seem like this printer uses ink quickly. The printer ink is included, and it takes about 7 - 10 minutes to initialize before you can use it. But really, what printer ink is cheap? I have a Canon printer, where the wireless troubleshooting guide is twice the size as the printer's manual. This printer prints one of the best quality photos I've ever seen, and FAST!But if you plan to print without a computer, beware. This is a great AIO printer for photographic printing.SIZE:Wow...this AIO printer is huge and it weights more than 20 lbs. My other printer died on me a few months ago so I was fortunate to be able to choose this Epson Artisan 730 Color Inkjet printer. I bought this printer after two of the print heads on my artisan 710 permanently clogged and couldn't be fixed. I expected this printer to be similar to the 710 and I was right. If you are considering using this printer for high volume work with third party ink cartridges, I would consider a different printer. Overall I'm very happy.UPDATE (9/17/12):The printer apparently died over the weekend. This printer does the job nicely!SCANS:An important feature to me is being able to scan documents and photos. This printer is a bit bulky - it's rather heavy and takes up twice the space of my old HP printer, but it's much more of a printer. This makes it a good printer for people that do coupons or frequent print plain print jobs, but it does excellent photos as well. I had to use the printer's interface to set up the wireless as I did not have the right size USB cable, but printer found my network without a problem. so will not fit where my other printer was. This is my first Epson printer and I am very pleased with it. First, I will say this is a big printer and you do need to have room for it. To be fair, my Canon printer was four years old, but still, the faster print speed and better quality result of the Artisan 730 is a very nice improvement over the my Canon. I need a printer that can handle all types of paper including cardstock, and this printer handled all different types and weights of paper with ease. While testing out the printer, I didn't experience any paper jams which can sometimes happen when using duplex mode with larger documents. Getting the printer connected to the wireless network was extremely simple. It can be done directly on the printer or on the computer once software is installed. The printer does feature Airprint technology, but I did not use this feature.Ease-of-use:For the most part, the printer is easy to use once you get all the tape and packaging materials removed. The printer features 2 trays: 4X6 photo tray and traditional photo tray which holds a variety of sizes including letter and legal. The printer works well with our Windows 7 computers and wireless network.If you're looking for a space saving printer, this may not be the printer for you as it does have a fairly big footprint. I have been very pleased with the printer, in fact, owing to its intuitive controls, ease of use, and great scan/copy quality. My old printer was dye-based and only passable at text and graphics. But I debated between the Artisan and an Epson WorkForce printer, which uses pigment-based inks for crisper text. Previously, we had an older HP printer that refused to be seen by one or the other computer, so the compromise was to use my iMac, since we could use the now-common "hacktivator" to allow printing from iPhones and the iPad, and the Windows box would just go without. I found the printer on the network and the Mac found the drivers it needed by itself. The printer takes advantage of Apple's AirPrint feature, so don't bother downloading any apps unless you have an older iPhone that can't use this.Printing, scanning, everything has worked flawlessly, with excellent photo quality on Epson high-quality photo paper. The printer has a screen that prompts you to scan directly, that doesn't work - it wants you to scan to a card, not to a computer.M
