This chair was comfortable and supportive for about 2 months. Received this chair really fast because I had the Amazon Prime. It really is a gorgeous looking chair. The chair smelled horrible and sitting on it for 5 minutes, I got a really bad headache from the fumes. Also, the chair was rock hard! The chair is softening up a bit. It's still very firm, but I'm thinking that it's good to have a nice, firm chair for back support rather than a squishy chair that will allow for bad posture. I bought this chair based on the many positive reviews here on amazon. The chair lives up to my expectations based on the many positive things said on this forum. The chair comes with clear directions and a small Allen Wrench, grab a Phillips head screwdriver and you're good to go. I'll be returning the chair. I wouln't say this chair is comfortable.

When I bought this chair I did so because it was advertised as "Leather".

However it's deceiving to advertise this chair as leather.

So expect to get in and out of the chair multiple times to get the sitting position you want.AssemblyOver the past 30 years, I must have assembled a dozen of these.
