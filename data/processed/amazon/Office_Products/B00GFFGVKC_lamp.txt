I have another, similar (admittedly, less expensive) lamp that has the power cord coming in in such a way that it often falls out (or is bumped out) of the socket. THIS lamp has the connection cord using sort of an L-shaped end that is extremely unlikely to be disconnected.The little touch pad that turns the light on and off does stay dimly lit, even when the light is off. But, if you're looking for a fancy lamp, you're not as concerned about its price like me, so here goes my review.Oh my goodness, this lamp is stupendous. I didn't know what using a lamp with the fancy polarizing technology can make everything gentler and more comfortable to my eyes while reading. I use this lamp on my computer desk, which otherwise is a really dark space. What a great lamp for my work desk! This lamp is is easy on my budget, too, with 5 adjustable LED light settings that range from 1.3 to 7 watts max. I really love this LED lamp, it's bright but with much less glare than a florescent lamp and it has a 5-level brightness adjustment. But I am not sure I would spend over $100 for this lamp, to me, it's just too much. The entire lamp is made of plastic which is of good quality.-The brightness is roughly equivalent to the other LED lamps I have used in the past (Softech Smart LED Desk LampandKoncept Z-Bar LED Desk Lamp). I have this lamp on one side of a 48" wide desk and the light just barely gets to the other side. I would prefer the lamp be a few inches higher.Overall, 3M has made a high-quality LED lamp with good materials and great controls. The lamp is hot, but extremely bright and made it easy to read. I recently replaced it with a competing LED lamp which did a nice job, but wasn't quite perfect. The lamp is an array of white LED's that sit behind the polarizing filter. The lamp has a simple wall-wart style power supply you plug in for power.The biggest improvement over competing LED desk lamps is in the color rendition (not too blue, the perfect color for reading) and the polarized light which reduces glare, especially when you are reading glossy items like magazines.It might have been nice if the lamp head itself could tilt to the side, but I found the simple 2-hinge adjustment seemed sufficient for lighting my work area without too much glare on the screen.Recommended solution for your desk! The lamp works exactly as stated; no glare, adjustable settings, and is extremely stylish. It is a beautiful lamp, and if the room is well lit with other lights it fine to read by. This lamp is basically &#34;plug and play&#34; - out of the box, remove the protective packaging bits, and plug it right in to the outlet. The lamp has two adjustable hinges - one at the base and one at the head that allow you to adjust the distance and angle of the lamp to your work surface. This lamp is perfect and provides terrific lighting for the sewing space. Love this lamp and the touch sensor and the dim control! This lamp is very modern in look and initially I was impressed by it. This lamp has permanently replaced the desk lamp we got for Christmas. It's a beautiful looking lamp but for the price I would have expected somewhat better materials than just plastic. The lamp doesn't rotate away from the base but you can angle the vertical bar and the horizontal lamp portion. The lamp has 5 brightness settings that you gently touch to turn on or for how bright you want it or need it. This lamp has 3 levels of light which is enough for most people and the touch controls are easier to use: you do not even have to look at the controls.Although 3M polarizing light LED is a very good quality lamp, unless you need 5 levels of polarized light, it is not worth the cost, which is probably applicable to most people. However, this stylish and elegant lamp is perfect for anyone's office or could even work in many rooms where you'd like a nice non-glare light to work by.

And I won't.The lamp's off/on switch is in the center of a ring of five "buttons" which can be touched or just swiped to increase or decrease the amount of light.

I got this lamp in and set it up on my bedside bed, not really expecting much.

The lamp is attractively designed and is adjustable at two points...the bottom hinge where it connects to the base and then at the top, where the lamp head connects to the long vertical arm.I also like the way the electric plug fits in.
