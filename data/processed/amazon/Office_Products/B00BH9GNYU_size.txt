And the size is quite adequate as well. It is medium size, just 17 x 23, but it serves its purpose. It's a good size for most normal white board uses and looks nice enough to hang anywhere from an office to a kitchen to a kid's room. (If you don't necessarily need this larger size, please see Quartet Magnetic Dry-Erase  11 inch x 14 inch magnetic white board, I really prefer it for home and use it on the fridge, it looks nice and the chrome color frame is of better quality than the &#34;wood&#34;.) I chose this primarily for its size, but the wood-like border dresses it up enough to keep in my cube at work. It's just the right size for my space. The size is perfect for my use, which is half work, half personal, and I couldn&#8217;t be happier with it! The size is generous, at 17&#34;x13&#34;, and the surface that magnets will attach to is all to the good, too. It is a nice size for notes and quick 1:1 conversations with drawings. This 17&#34;x23&#34; Quartet Magnetic Dry-Erase Board is a perfect size for writing notes, grocery list, etc.. I had the smaller one but I really like the bigger size. Good size for this use. Overall size is 17&#34; x 23&#34; exactly as shown in the description, but I thought you'd want to know that the write-on white surface is 15&#34; x 21&#34;. The size is perfect and was happy amazon carries this. The actual size of the writing space is 14.75 x 20.75&#34;.I haven't used it a lot yet, but when I write on it with the supplied little dryerase marker, it wiped off cleanly.
