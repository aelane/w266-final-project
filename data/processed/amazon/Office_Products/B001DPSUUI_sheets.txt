Since both these sheets and my laminator are from Fellowes I had hoped they would be designed to work optimally together so it is a little disappointing to still have some quality issues. They are sturdy sheets and can be used on multiple types of laminating machines. However, some ingredient sheets that I laminated with 3 mil pouches about two years ago are holding up fine, despite being abused in the cookbook rack in a busy kitchen. I love the Fellows Brand of laminate sheets. I didn't think that 150 sheets of laminating paper would weigh that much. I have used numerous laminating sheets in the past, they were all rather flimsy and produced moderate results. These are Heavy Duty sturdy laminating sheets that hold a full letter size sheet. The laminated sheets are not stiff like the more heavier weight pouches but are a good step up from your standard 3 mil laminating pouches that come with the laminating machine. Square lam sheets with cut corners can be sharp, not good for children or clumsy adults like me, lol.Interesting test: I laminated a fine art inkjet photo that I had printed on Hahnemuhle Photo Rag 60lb paper (wedding shot for a serviceman getting deployed, so the picture wouldn't get damaged, and I was more than happy with how the lam sheet adhered to the textured paper, the photo came out excellent. These lam sheets are the ones I'll continue to purchase in ther future. I use these laminated sheets all the time for my company, and they work great. That's usually what I want to know about laminating sheets before I buy them.
