The cases open and operate as stands so you can easily select your pens. The cases they have developed for this set are brilliant. In particular, the cases are easy to move from place to place for those of us that gather supplies to work on projects in front of the TV. The cases are a huge improvement over the stadium stand. The cases in this set are much more convenient and compact, though also displaying the pens so the user can easily pick the one he or she wants. The cases fold closed and lock shut so they can be easily carried by the handle on top of each case.The pens themselves write smoothly. Then you can flip it closed and safely store the cases away so the pens don't get lost. The TEKwriter USA Gelwriter Gel Pen set comes with 2 carrying cases with 36 pens in each. Both cases are flip cases so you can easily sit them on your desk or table and see all of the colors. The cases are great for storing the pens and also made it easier for us to keep up with the pens as we used several different colors. Heads up, be sure to treat the cases with care or they could easily crack.
