There is a lot of waste if you only use the 1-1/2"x3" section.2. We do a lot of canning and use cookbooks quite a bit. I see a lot of reviews for those notetabs here and wanted to add that those are very useful for knitters who use charts. But I don't know that I'll be using a lot of these, as it could get expensive fairly quickly. I wanted the Avery NoteTabs because I own a lot of cookbooks. I do a lot of paperwork. I do a lot of deposition and document review, and these let me make notes without marring the original. I tend to read a lot of non-fiction books. Unfortunately a lot of the books I like to mark on and make notes aren't really strong enough for these, but I did find some Cookbooks and more heavy duty books that these fit on quite nicely and I was able to make notes right on the tab while still being able to read the text and not ruin the pages themselves. As I have a lot of notes on my calendar, I still want to see what's under my highlight.I'm used to using various sizes of sticky notes and having to place them approximately where I want to write or memo something.I'd probably give it 3-1/2 stars if that were an option - the additional deduction based on cost.

I reuse it and don't wast a lot of paper.

If you can learn to reuse these over and over you can save a lot of paper and maybe help save a few trees.

I'm also swearing a lot less.I'm a writer, and while researching I highlight passages, write in the margins, dog-ear pages, and commit a number of other atrocities.
