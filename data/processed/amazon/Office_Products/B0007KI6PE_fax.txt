It's a small fax that simply gets the job done. But if you're looking for a small fax to keep in your home office this seems great. This is a good little fax machine, however, you cannot fax very large quanites at once. I would say no more than 10, which is fine if it is not being used as your only fax. I bought a Cannon 3-in-1 fax, printer, scanner and love it! This fax machine is not even reliable, because it says the fax goes through, but then it actually does not. and told them my fax mach was missing the curly phone cord for the hand set. HOWEVER, if you're like us, and only use your fax for sending the occasional missive to those people in the stone age who can't get email, suck it up and deal. A very user friendly fax machine. I highly recommend for a cheap fax. I got this fax to use for sending or receiving the occasional fax and making quick copies. then you're probably not going to be able to read your important fax because the "carbon paper" spools were meant to be used once, and there's not going to be any "ink" left for the machine to print. Putting the fax together from the box was simple. Good fax machine. Other than that the fax machine itself is of very decent quality. )If you are looking for a simple fax machine at a very affordable price, this unit probably fits that bill. I don't use the fax machine as much as a I do the printer/copier, so this works nicely. I replaced a comparable HP fax machine with this one because the HP used an expensive inkjet cartridge that dries up if you don't receive a fax or make a copy regularly. This Brother fax machine does not have this problem, the ribbon cartridge does not dry up, which is nice.
