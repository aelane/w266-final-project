Anyway, the board works well. I can't recommend this board at either of those prices.I do recommendQuartet ReWritables Mini Dry-Erase Markers, which I received at the same time as this board. The white board portion is nice and smooth and erases easily. That wouldn't be so bad, but I had planned on using this board in a vertical position.Unfortunately, the design doesn't really allow you to change the orientation of the board. The white board works well with set of colired dry erase markers that I already had. This board is sturdier than others we've owned and the division of the space between magnetic white board and cork board makes sense and makes the board as a whole more useful. That being said, this combo board is a welcome addition to my home office to capture ideas and priority To Do items at a glance in my small space. I really like this board and the quality is terrific. I still like the board though. This is a very nice white board, it's a great size, and the cork area is great for pinning little sticky notes so I don't lose them in my desk clutter. This board is magnetic so if you have magnetic markers and don't mind giving up white board space to store them there, then no worries for you. Otherwise, I highly recommend this board, it really helps my office organization. The whilte board writes and erases easily.5. The magnetic white board works well with the supplied two magnets or other aftermarket supplied magnets.Cons:1. This board is in a sweet spot as far as size, big enough to be usable for several things but not unwieldy or awkwardly large. The board is stiff and has a nice frame; aluminum on the top and bottom and plastic on the sides. This board is a decent size--big enough but not so big that you'll have a hard time finding a place for it. By turning this board to the side, it's the perfect size for my skinny kitchen nook right by the phone.

They enjoy a white board for drawing, activities, memos... and this one is large enough for all of it.

My ideal board, for the same purpose would have a couple of extra inches of white board subtracting from the cork surface.

I am using it as a portable board on an easel, so I can carry it with me from office space to home studio and prop up my list-in-progress.
