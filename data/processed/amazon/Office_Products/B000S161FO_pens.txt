Also, the pens are in trays inside the external packaging. These pens work great, they tend to smudge a little when pressed with hand, but if you do any free writing this won't be a hassle for you. The pens are perfect to use for decorations on posters, diary, notes, calendar and much more. I use gel pens for scrap booking and these provide me with 48 different choices. I have used every one of these pens and they all work flawlessly. At $12 for 48 pens this is a great buy! These pens seem to have resolved that problem. The pens (all except the 4 fusion colors) all write smoothly, with no major ink flow problems. These pens are now amongst my most used!! The pens have NOT dried out w/o them.
