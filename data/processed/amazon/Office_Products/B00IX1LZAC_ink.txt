That is even true for the green ink, which is usually the weakest of any four-color set. I need to switch ink colors a lot at work and this pen is just the ticket. The good: the ink writes very smoothly, with only a few minor glops (and only if I tried to make them, and rubbed the result to see if it would smear). The ink is smooth and glides very well. The ink cartridges are retracted by pulling down slightly on the pocket clip.This pen has red, green, black, and blue. The ink seems to blob just a bit, but it may get better with use. The ink flows beautifully, it's a pleasure to hold - and it's got 4 colors of ink, a pencil, and an eraser! )We'll see how long it takes before I'm replacing the ink cartridges - it looks like a reasonable proposition at current prices, anyway. The ink skips and doesn't write well if it has been sitting a bit. I really like the Uni StyleFit, which has gel ink refills. The ink colors are black (indicated by grey on the pen), blue, green, and red. If you're using an ink color, when you're done, press on one of the other colors, and that will pop the color you're using back into the pen.I have the blue, which is a pretty almost cobalt blue, with a metallic look to it.
