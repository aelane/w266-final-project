It works well for very light-weight items. I think these could hold heavier items, and it is always removable without damage. Since I take down such items within a few hours, risk of damage seems to be minimal.Another big interest was using them to position items for viewing when working in constricted spaces, for example attaching a "cheat sheet" onto the side of my computer display. For items posted on or near a door, this gap allowed the breeze to get behind which might be a problem for items mounted on or near a door, such as outside a meeting.--- Aside ---Withholding basic/critical product information from customers is unfortunately widespread. These are NOT going to hold-up large items. Doesn't work too well on pourous items like cork boards and textured walls. They do work, and are reusable, but are not appropriate for many common items and surfaces because they're just too sticky. They're appropriate for items you want to mount semi-permanently - until the stickiness wears off. They're for lightweight items. I remind myself to take various items to work (usually food, sometimes novels) and church. I hung items on the refrigerator, and used them to hang to-do lists while working away from home. I removed items by following the directions provided on the packaging and slowly removing the paper item then slowly removing the adhesive square from the surface used as a base. They're strong enough to hold those items to just about any standard wall surface (save stucco-type surfaces) with no damage to the plasticized product being hung, or the wall surface that said item is being adhered to. I can see them being great for anchoring down items in a display. I am going to use these to tack down some items around my desk (anchor a small USB hub to the bottom of my monitor, anchor a CF card reader to the side of my computer. They work well hanging lightweight items on stainless steel, plastic, glass, wood, painted walls and concrete. They are intended for mounting lightweight items (unframed artwork, photos, cards, etc) to a flat surface.3M advertises that they can be used to mount objects to flat stainless steel, plastic, concrete, glass, wood, painted walls.What I can say is that they are definitely stronger than advertised. But if you stick items on the walls and doors a lot, say a family with school going kids or an artist, then these tabs could be very useful.
