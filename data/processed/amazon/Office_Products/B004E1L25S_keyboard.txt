I think this is a very nice keyboard, strong and extremely well built. And that means that this keyboard tray has to stand all the use and abuse that it receives from my 4, 8 and 10 year old, and let me tell you, so far it has taken all the swiveling and adjusting that my kids give it.Overall this is a great buy, less expensive than other brands offering the same functionality. I have used other keyboard trays over years, some are more fancier than this Fellowes Designer Suites Premium Keyboard Tray. But I think this Fellowes' keyboard tray is one at the top of the list.First of all, the attached instruction sheets are very clear with pictures showing where to position the tray, where to drill the holes and which screws to be used for each hole. This keyboard has enough resistance when sliding in and out. I highly recommend this keyboard. Coupled with a good keyboard tray, you can get your neck angel and back posture perfect. I actually prefer to have my keyboard on the top of my desk as it's a converted drafting table that I have set to a specific height for my chair in order to maximize my mobility. The Designer Suites premium keyboard tray doesn't disappoint. I was hoping I could also swing the keyboard tray side to side, but the mount doesn't allow for that. This keyboard tray is a nice replacement for an old one which wasn't adjustable or comfortable. This is the second keyboard tray from Amazon that we have installed and are using on two different types of desks. I like this Fellowes keyboard tray a lot. If you are like me and didn't think a keyboard drawer could make a huge difference, you have to try this drawer. I have a smaller keyboard and it fits perfectly, but I imagine there are a few that would hang over the edge, especially some of the larger Logitech ones.I'm not saying this is a cure for carpal tunnel, but for some of us, it could provide some relief from the pain and discomfort. That will allow the keyboard to extend a reasonable distance from the desk, yet still slide under the desk far back enough not to interfere at other times. I positioned the keyboard so it covers those holes as much as possible.
