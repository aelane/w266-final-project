They (Avery) offers free templates at their website: avery.com/templates. The templates were easy to set up and use. Avery templates are very easy to use too. I generally really like Avery templates but they seriously missed the mark here. I really don't see why templates for the most common software can't be included on a disk that would come with the ticket stock pages. The templates allow for using the tear off portion on the right, the left or on the top. Avery has a few templates on-line for this product that are free to use and help provide a professional look for folks like me who don't do "design" very well. Avery has the templates set up and they are sooo easy for me to use. Easy to use free templates at Avery's site. Unfortunately there are no Adobe templates, which is not good since professional graphic artists are much more likely to use Adobe than Microsoft software. The templates are geared towards family and school novelty projects. The templates provided online are not nearly as comprehensive or versatile as they could be. These ARE compatible with Mac, but the templates that Avery provides are in Microsoft Word format, so you'll either need Word or another compatible application that doesn't mess up the special tables set to format the tickets. Avery even offers pre-made templates for several options, including bake sales and sporting events.The tickets have enough room for some sales copy as well as to give free reign to creative ideas, and each ticket comes with a perforated stub.The quality is excellent, as you'd expect -- these tickets will perform well and make you look good. The templates at avery.com make it very easy to do those and other projects, and the tickets are very flexible in use due to thei tear-away stubs ... The templates could be a little easier to use, but worked just fine. I found the templates to be non-intuitive. The templates did not allow me adequate creative options to design the tickets as I wanted them to appear. You can also download templates to design your tickets.When I initially downloaded the templates, I thought I'd end up giving this product three stars, or perhaps even two. You have to really work at figuring out the templates. I was a little disappointed with the templates provided. If Avery continues to create more interesting and varied templates, I may revisit this review.
