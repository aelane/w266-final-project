It's nice that Epson sells each color cartridge separately, so that I'm able to replace just the cartridge needed, but I don't think I'll be able to afford much color printing at this rate. Scanning into color PDF files took a couple of minutes per page, including the file conversion. Making a color copy on the standard quality setting using the ADF took about 26 seconds including the scanner warm up. The CMY color pack is about the same price.There is one issue that is almost worthy of losing a star. You can even choose black and white or color. There is a 1-1/2" X 2" color display LCD screen that handles all your ongoing functions. This color display allows you to set up all your features, including your Network name, Network password, dates, times, firewall alert messages and any ongoing functions you are involved with. Faxing in either black or color is about 3 seconds per page and the Epson stores up to 60 telephone numbers  with a Fax memory up to 180 pages! The color seemed nice and sharp. For color printing the results were a bit mixed. The color print speed wasn't exceptional. I have printed black and white and color copies and have no complaints so far; I have also printed a few pages of photographs and those came out well, too. Black and white as well as color print outs look great.
