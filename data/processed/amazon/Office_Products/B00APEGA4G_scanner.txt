The scanner claims to be able to gracefully handle 10 page documents. This is a nice scanner to take with you when you take your laptop. I plugged the scanner into my USB drive on my laptop and I was in business in less than 5 minutes. The scanner is so simple, I didn't have to read any instructions in order to use the scanner or the software.The overall size is about the length and width of a ruler, and slightly more than an inch tall.The paper feed tray flips down and two pieces swivel out hold the paper. I think this was because I had the scanner on the side of my couch and not a flat surface. On the scanner, there is a switch to "auto start" the scanning once the pages are fed into the printer. at once.I really love this scanner. It works just as well as the Xerox scanner at my office. This scanner allows you to do receipts and small items (like Doxie & NeatReceipts) yet has a more robust set of features for larger documents. I liked how simple it was to unfold the scanner and feed pages in, and I feel that for the average home user looking to minimize their clutter, this is an excellent scanner that should take care of the average stack of household paperwork.However, for businesses, this isn't a substitute for a desktop model, and is much better for the person who actually needs the portable capability of such a device, such as a bookkeeper who travels to clients' offices or a sales person who needs to scan a series of documents while traveling or on the go. It's as easy as turning it on connecting the scanner to the computer (in my case, an iMac) with the enclosed USB 2.0 hi-speed cable, and double-clicking on the CaptureOnTouch Lite button. But if you're looking for a "little scanner that could"...a scanner that's light enough to fit into your laptop case for business traveling...you can't go wrong. The P 208 personal scanner is a very light weight device (1.3 lbs) measuring 12  inches long by 2 1/8 inches in width and 1  inches in height. I personally prefer a flatbed scanner for daily use. This small, lightweight scanner produces clear, detailed copies in no time. I have a big old scanner at work that doesn't function very well, now that I know I don't need any special software, I'll be bringing this in. I'm loving this scanner for the portability and ease of use. The Canon P-208 is a nice portable scanner that fits in a briefcase or computer bag, or that can sit in a corner of your desktop or in a drawer if you need to do a quick scan of a few pages. I use this scanner as a notary to scan back documents to title companies. I don't take the scanner with me, but keep it at home and attach it to the computer as needed. You can't run this scanner without having it connected to the computer via USB cable for power (unless you buy an additional piece of hardware). The scanner does not scan blank sections or pages. However, this little scanner actually does a much better job on double sided scanning.No other power source is needed, only the USB cord. This allows me to store the scanner on top of my computer tower where two USB ports are located. This scanner does not claim to be a photo scanner so I did not expect great results, but was hoping for better than just acceptable results.
