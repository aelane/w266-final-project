It also means I go through twice as many labels. You could easily improvise using cheaper labels and dividers. Both the labels and templates are easy-peasy. No more guessing if the labels are loaded correctly... You can print labels to be used on both sides of the index tabs. But adding labels individually to a tab is not really that stressful for me.I would like to see the dividers made out of thicker paper or a cardstock. For just a few labels for office use, this was simply more trouble than it was worth. These are great labels to have around. When you print the labels, peel and align on the divider definitely looks more professional. It is easy and less time-consuming compared to writing all the labels by hand. The labels included are extremely easy to use, and work flawlessly with Microsoft Word and the Avery templates. I'm sure these labels don't contribute much but every breath may soon count a great deal, especially for our grandchildren. Now 50 labels may seem like a lot, but if you're printing for an office or conference, that's a drop in the bucket. I designed my labels in color, ran a couple of tests, making the necessary adjustments in design and alignment, printed the labels with baited breath, and enjoyed the application process which was very fast and efficient. You print your labels on a strip that can then be applied to 5 dividers at once (must be aligned).Another great Avery product. I'm very pleased with these labels, however.One thing to be aware of: the product cover which notes that the "guarantee extends only to a sheet of labels that has been fed through a printer a single time". Initially I'd planned to use these labels and dividers for my son's school binder, which contains only 5 subjects, but since each sheet of label strips contains 25 labels (5 rows of 5) and can only be run through the one time, it would have been a waste.For personal use, I can't think of other similarly large projects for which I'd need 25 labels at a time. )The peel-and-stick labels adhere well to the tabs, but also can be unpeeled from the tabs later, if you do so carefully. Too complicated for just the few labels I want to print.Overall if you are putting together lots of labels it could be worth your time. As well, the labels all go on straighter and more professionally. All the labels can be handwritten as well.Recommended for those doing volume labeling. It is also much quicker than peeling small clear labels and attempting to apply them neatly to each individual tab. You can also print labels for both the fronts and backs of your tabs at the same time. I personally love these labels, but can see where others wouldn't. I have to admit to being a little intimidated with trying to affix five labels simultaneously, but it's a lot easier than it looks. This means printing 50 labels out. I'm going to see if I can pick these up in colored labels -- that would be sweet and perfect for how I use this product (essentially a career portfolio).

If you like professional and uniform looking labels - and I do - then this is a great product.

What sets the Avery labels apart is that the label itself is clear.

But generally I need to create only a few labels at a time - and I don't want to wait months until I have 50 labels that need printed!
