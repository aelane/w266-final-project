I would rather just use a traditional post-it note pad. And you can use the cheaper note pads that aren't pop-up (I never understood why they charge more for the pop-up ones, they seem to cost the same to make). Just slip the note pad in the decorative packet, pull the strips off the top/bottom on the back then fold the side tabs in; gently press it to the cover of your laptop and you're ready to go. Frankly, I will stick with my post-it note pad, pulling them off one at a time--I need the exercise. A Post-it note is always waiting there, at the ready. When pulling 1 note out of the dispenser the next comes through ready to use without coming out which has been a problem with some other dispensers I've used. These post-it note packs attach securely to my MacBook, and they are equally easy to remove without any leftover residue. At 20 note apiece, it's just too small even discounting those peeled off by colleagues during meetings (it surely is a great conversation starter). If I want to make a quick note of something I fund on the Internet, there they are. These new Post-It note pads in a slim dispenser offer the convenience of portability. Most current note paper is unsatisfactory for my needs until this product entered the scene. Do you really have to stick note papers to your laptop? The Post-it Pop-up note dispenser is useful for preserving the physical integrity of the post-it notes and pads - as long as it's not exposed to too much jostling or damage. This is your basic sticky note pad, but it comes with a holder that sticks to your laptop. I was forever losing my Post-It note pad in the shuffle of papers on my desk. Even if you don't write on the note before dispensing, the notes come out bent, wrinkled, or torn if not all three. We did think it was really funny when we stuck a note on one of the cats who acted as messenger from one room to another. Now, a note is almost always available while I'm writing or researching the internet using my laptop. These are flimsy post-it note dispensers that you're supposed to stick to the back of your laptop screen. You'd write yourself a note on your laptop itself! The post-it note has a wrinkled appearance and just doesn't look neat when attached to a piece of paper or other surface. Maybe there are better post-it note dispensers, but I certainly can't recommend this one. These note dispensers are great to stick on your laptop so that you always have something on hand to write on.
