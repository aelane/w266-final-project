Another great Avery product. A good product that I hope to use and reuse regularly for a long time. I don't know how I'd get along without this product! A wonderful product that supports an excellent cause. Very useful product at an affordable price.Here are other products that work with these dividers...Avery Mini Durable View Comfort Touch Binder with 1 inch Round Ring, Green(...)Avery Mini Assorted Binder Pockets(...)Avery Filler Paper 5.5 x 8.5 Inches (Ruled)(...) A great product that I highly recommend! This is an inexpensive product to keep your 1/2 size binder neat and organized. It is well-made and I highly recommend this product. While this is a good product & I stand by the Avery name, I mistakenly ordered these thinking they would fit a full sized binder. I recommed this product. This is a great product. I loved this product because I could clean it off and re use when my project priorities change throughout the year and beyond. I would definitely recommend this product to other customers. This is a great product. Great product and I highly recommend! Great product.
