Unfortunately, not this time. It's been a long time since I replaced my Panazonic FAX machine and having the Epson Workforce Wireless All in One Colour Inkjet and absolutely love it! It would error or get stuck every time that I tried this. And maybe time will tell if this one holds up over increased usage. While I can't comment on the last one (time will tell), I'm pretty sure the Epson WorkForce WF-3520 Wireless All-in-One isn't going to hurt my established opinion.Setup is very easy. I just select Scan to PC on the LCD, and generally by the time I get back to my laptop, the JPG or PDF is waiting on me. There was a time when I WASN'T a fan of all-in-one office equipment, but I've become converted over time. Every time I turn on the printer, it takes about 30 sec to connect to my home wifi network. Fortunately, it only has to be performed once but might be slightly time consuming for those with longer network and password names.Build quality is excellent and the footprint is small enough for the printer to be placed on top of a medium sized bookshelf. It saves me so much time when I can just xerox/scan at home, instead of going to Kinkos.The 3520 is another fantastic printer from Epson. A short time ago I got a request for faxed pictures for a damage claim because the supervisor "couldn't give out his e-mail address" so it's something which is still used.

At this time you will have scan options for previewing the document and sizing it and such.

Every time I've used the fax feature, it's worked without any issues.~Conclusion~The printer can be set up both wirelessly or with a regular wires in connection.

BUT this time around, the WorkForce 3520 had no problem in being detected and printing.
