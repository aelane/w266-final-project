I've used these labels with a Brother color inkjet and had no issues. The labels print out nicely and look good. These labels have a nice DIY aesthetic. These are very nice labels, we used them for homemade gifts and they are look great. I like to create my own labels for the jars and pillars. You can resize your own logo/graphic to fit the labels by using a net-based photo resize program.To create different text effects, such as concave or rainbow, Insert>Word Art. They are sturdy labels, and very sticky, so once they are in place, there is no moving them! Unlike other labels, this combination of shape and material does not suggest "homemade in a computer printer", which is good. These labels stick to glass, plastic, and paper, so you can label or advertise your business on any product. I would recommend these labels for any small business or even for  church or charity use. These labels are a really nice option for a small craft business. If you are tired of the usual boring white labels that are usually available in office supply stores, Avery has released some new label products that could make you smile. With 225 labels, one package of these labels should be enough for several projects. Kraft labels usually come in light, medium, or dark--I'd say these are more like a medium shade of brown.When using Kraft labels, one most likely is going for a "natural," organic effect--thus, plain, dark colors work best for printing. I got these labels for a craft project that involves rubber stamping. The labels stick nicely to a variety of surfaces' glass, some plastic, cellophane, paper, cardboard, even metal (I'm not sure how long it will last, but so far so good). So the labels themselves get 5 stars.The TemplatesHere's where I had a lot of trouble. They do make the labels in white and other shapes and I suspect the non-circular shapes are easier to center for printing as it is with other Avery labels. Maybe this is inherent in printing circular labels, but I was really looking forward to getting beautiful circle labels from my inkjet printer without spending an inordinate amount of time to get there. I love these labels BUT I like them a lot more for original hand designs than for use with computers. I plan to continue working with the labels until I get exactly what I want, even if I have to use the whole pack trying, because their look is ideal for home/hand-made items. These labels look great: thick, dark brown kraft paper that has a nice, textured look. These particular labels are 2.5" diameter (smaller than you might imagine in your head), but work great for gift bags, books & CDs, and things like that. I'm looking forward to creating labels for some of my handmade artwork and using the nice shapes and "organic" Kraft paper to create a professional look for my work. I like the labels a lot, but when I opened the package, I really noticed how small they are. I had been planning some new labels for the items I made for the holidays and was wondering what I would do about printing them. The labels are available in variety of shapes and sizes and can be ordered in Kraft or white. I ordered these labels in the "brown" tone. Avery makes these same labels in white if you wish for your design to be colorful and bright. these labels are very professional looking and stick incredibly well to almost every surface. These labels also make very pretty and professional looking book plaques. At first when I received these labels, I wasn't sure what I would use these labels for. The labels are thick enough to easily peel off the backing and place without tearing. These Avery labels were easy to use. Very useful labels! Used these labels to make labels for paper merchandise bags for a local craft fair. So, I volunteered to create some labels for her and these did the trick. The only labels I use for my business
