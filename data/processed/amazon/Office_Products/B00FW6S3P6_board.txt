I've had a white board on the side of my refrigerator for years. The board itself is magnetic, and a couple of magnets to hold paper memos or notes included, along with a dry-erase marker with a built-in eraser.The red color is a shade toward the burgundy side, just so you know. This dry-erase board came with magnets, and I was going to use it on my fridge for a daily caper/chore chart. I have had a white board in every office I've occupied in the last 20 years because they help me visualize my projects, communicate to others and jot down random thoughts I need to remember.This Quartet board is the smallest I have ever worked with before and initially, I thought it would only be good for grocery lists. The board quality is OK - the back of the board is cheap cardboard, so I don't know how long this will last. The board feels very cheap--cardboard back and plastic frame but the worst part is that it won't stay on the wall. This white board is only okay. I am only semi-happy with this board. This is a decent white board for the price. The board comes with two magnets which can be used to affix items to the white board. My board came with clear magnets, which are considerably less attractive than the striped magnets. I did not try hanging the board up on a wall, so I'm not sure whether that would hold well. In short, a good enough white board. This board is great and the perfect size to fit on a fridge for shopping lists or notes. I was looking for a new dry-erase board for the fridge, as our old one was dropped and cracked on the side. Our old board was maybe 11x14, but even that little extra room made a huge difference.I guess it would be ok for a dorm, or if you're old writing on it, and not using the included magnets to hold anything up... If you take a dry-erase board like this, draw properly spaced lines with a ruler and a permanent marker, you have a great reusable practice tablet for learning letters. If you're using the board on a wall, they have plenty of sticky power for going through one layer of card stock, but they get iffy at 2 cards. If you're carrying the board around, I'd skip magneting anything to it--put them on the fridge, because they're good ones.3. This is an inexpensive board, so I wasn't expecting much in quality. But it turns out to be a very nice little board. A nice simple white board. The board comes with double sided adhesive strips. The board comes with two little magnets that work well for tacking that shopping list. Nothing special, but a very functional board. I really like this dry-erase board. Now I can move the board if I need to simply by pulling it off and the velcro is still there so that the board can be mounted again elsewhere or back in the same spot.The color accent is also a nice touch and the little magnets are great for sticking a quick note to the board as well. This is a dry-erase board that I find to be the perfect size for the kitchen wall or refrigerator. This board is the perfect size for my refrigerator. This board has a good size to it and looks great. If you just need a small board for the occasional note, this will do wonders.The included magnets are a nice touch, and are stronger than I'm accustomed to coming from Quartet. So if you intend this board for heavy use, you might want to step up to the next price level. This is a great little board to mount unobtrusively on the backsplash of a kitchen counter. This board is used by my preschooler to practice drawing and handwriting. What can you say about a white board? The board contains a couple of magnetic surfaces that are slightly recessed from the frame, so the magnets do not have a full grip of the mounting surface, but still work well. This isn't our first Quartet Magnetic Dry Erase board. This board is a nice size for jotting down quick notes; the magnets are useful too.It's a little cheap-looking, with the green plastic border.The magnet that's on the end of the included marker really isn't strong enough to hold the marker in place, so I just added my own pieces of Velcro to the cap & board to hold it more tightly. It was obvious that this board is a fairly cheap one right out of the package, and I do not recommend using the little eraser that comes on the dry erase marker as it does not work well.If dinged even a bit, this board shows the ding very easily, but the magnetic pieces work beautifully and it's stayed on the refrigerator perfectly, helping us to remember what groceries we need. The white board surface is good quality. The Quartet dry-erase white board provides the practical way to make necessary notes and reminders. The Quartet Dry-Erase board is very handy for writing quick notes, shopping lists, or for your grandchild to draw to their heart's content. It is simple, though, to remove the board from the fridge, write on it, then put the board back.It also comes with a small, black dry erase marker that can be snapped into a holder at the top of the board. The board comes with a medium, black dry erase marker with an eraser on the end, two magnets and four each of 3-M brand permanent self stick mounting pads and self stick magnets with instructions for mounting.A great little dry erase board at an even greater price! I rated Quartet Magnetic Dry-erase board 4 stars because it is a nice product. All in all, if you need an inexpensive white board, this is fine. The board (sized 8.5X11) operates as both a dry erase writing board AND a magnetic bulletin board. The board also includes a dry-erase marker and two magnets allowing you to start using it immediately.I will also say that the product is pretty sturdy. The board made it through this ordeal with only a slight tear on the backside. They stick very well to not only the board to most anything you'd care to stick it to.the surface is magnetic, and includes 2 magnets and a magnetic pen with eraser. Instead it is a metal white board with a thick cardboard backing inside a plastic frame.S
