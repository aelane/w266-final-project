I can stick it or unstick it easily to any surface so I never have to worry about it moving around. This surface works great! Also with the restickable surface I was able to trim down the size slightly and it just sticks on to the top of my laptop cover during transport.Wonderful product!! The textured surface allows the mouse to glide effortlessly and the texture, according to 3M's testing, can extend battery life of wireless mice "up to 75%". I find the top surface of the mouse pad pleasingly yet not overly rough, and suspect it is perhaps behind the increased precision my wireless mouse suddenly has. It's got a great smooth surface. I can't recommend the 3M Precise Optical Mousing Surface unless you're absolutely sure you're going to like mousing on a rough surface. This mousing surface works ok, but has to be taped down to a hard surface and can not be moved later. I don't want to try to pull the mousing surface off to see if it will re-stick as I am afraid it won't stick again and then I won't be able to use it. I found the surface to be just too sensitive for me, I could not hold the mouse steady. The surface is also easy to clean. Just make sure you have a clean surface, as any dust will attach themselves to the mouse pad. The surface is designed for Optical Mouse. If you are looking for an inexpensive re-appliable surface for your mouse, look no further. My other one is a "Wowpad", which I prefer to the 3M because it is round and the surface isn't quite as bumpy.Personally I think the ability to stick the mouse pad to the cover of my laptop is a bit gimmicky. I am not sure how long this will continue to stick.The mousing surface feels good when using a mouse on it. I bought the 3M surface based on the reviews and I'm happy to say that it is working just as well for us. Also, the surface is easy to clean and stays clean in comparison to the soft foam-type mouse pads. Has a great, smooth surface and is sleek-looking.

This just slightly rough surface is designed perfectly to make mouse use flow.

Maybe it's more accurate to call it a "mousing surface" but I just can't bring myself to do that.

The sticky surface also keeps the mouse "pad" from moving which happens with almost all mouse pads.
