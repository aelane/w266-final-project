Once I grab ahold of it the zipper does NOT want to make that first turn around the corner. I like that there is an extra zipper to get the expanding file, or you can get to it when you have the main binder open. This is a very nice 3 ring zipper binder. With the other zipper, you have a 6 file folder compartment which is accessible to the first compartment via a velcro closure. The zipper pocket is also a plus and is nice and secure. This zipper binder is very nice. The zipper runs freely and smoothly and I think this will hold up for at least a couple of years. I rated this zipper binder 4 stars then  picked it up to examine it while writing my review. This zipper binder is no different...it is larger & heavier than the traditional school binder.This is a very nice zippered binder with useful features, but Mead definitely needs more quality control on their production line  or maybe the design & fabric need  to be changed to make this binder more durable. The zipper is smooth and has several organization options inside it with a place for stationery as well. Unfortunately, that's where the zipper goes.My son likes it better, but he wish it had a few more folders. There is a zipper pocket that serves the need well with plenty of room to add glue, more pencils, highlighters and other items. Inside, there's a zipper pocket for miscellaneous small items, and a two-inch three ring binder that is advertised to hold 180 sheets. It is a stylish zipper binder that is neither drab nor gaudy, and the various pockets and partitions are a great way to help keep things organized. The zipper doesn't feel too quality, and is poorly integrated into the design of the binder. At the top the zipper splays off and leaves a wide open gap that will not close, unlike the bottom part. This is a durable zipper binder, with a rugged exterior that seems built to last.

I had a 5-star zipper binder in middle school that lasted me through the last year of high school, at which point the only reason I threw it out is because the zipper had broken.

The zipper opens the expanding file area, so you can get to files in there without opening the main binder zipper.

A smooth and durable zipper and strong handle add to the overall durability.
