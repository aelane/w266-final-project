You can create one label or a whole sheet of labels with the same or different addresses. You just print on the label and then fix it to the envelope.Avery also has pre-designed templates that feature clip art on the labels that you can download, also for free, so you can make personalized invitations or holiday cards etc.I highly recommend AVERY LABELS 8660 for ease of use and professional looking quality. If you need a label where you don't want the background to show, then then these lables are for you. With a clear label I can make a custom made label on my carefully crafted home brew that makes me look like a brewing professional. They are as clear as I expect a sticky label can be. The label is then wrapped around the wire and around itself with the printing being the last layer. They work as advertised producing a clear, clean label that is easy to place and read. Peel one label off a sheet, and keep the rest on the sheet.We will buy the easy peel labels even if they are somewhat more than the competition. This label is specified to ink-jets, but they work just fine on laser print too. You can easily extract a single label without bothering any of the others.Against truly dark items (do you really mail things in black envelopes all that often?) Avery Easy Peel 1 x 2 5/8 Clear label gives any envelope a professional look. I will still use my label maker for stuff that gets a lot of abuse or get wet (like soccer balls and drink cups) but these are much more discrete for labeling other possessions.I keep a three ring binder filled with printed address labels stored in slash pocket folders with tabs (labeled with a sample label)for the addresses I use frequently.
