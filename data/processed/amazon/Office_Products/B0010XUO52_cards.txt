There are only 100 cards in this package and as I recall, other packages I've gotten had more than this.These are made of good sturdy card stock, and the lines are fully printed without skips. What I liked best about these cards were the ink lines. Otherwise these cards are average and fine for multi-purpose use. Would I buy these over THICKER cards? It's bleached and these cards are well-pressed. If the cards get wet, though, the red coloring may run off. These are great little cards to make quick shipping lists or to post reminders on for bulletin boards. We use these cards to print a copy customer Driver's Licenses on the blank side and to record notes (name, store credit, etc) on the lined side. I won't be buying any of these Mead cards for $3.25 per hundred though. These cards are of average quality, only very very slightly heavier weight than the quality of cards available at dollar stores. I have to say I still miss the heavier cards that used to be available. These cards are a good weight and not flimsy like some other brands. *The Mead cards are more opaque (and like the cards I got at Walmart the cards are white-white, not at all off-white). My other cards are much thicker and better. I love Mead Index cards and buy a pack at least 3 times a year. These cards are a bit flimsy, not stiff card stock. These Mead cards have the usual red line at the top with blue lines beneath. With these cards, when I write on the first side, I can see and feel the imprint of my writing on the second side. The cards are standard sized to fit inside filing boxes available at stationery stores.Parents can use index cards to teach reading words to young children. I am comparing these cards against the Oxford brand of cards, and what is the verdict...They are just a flimsy feeling, with other words thin, the Mead cost +2 times as much. These cards are the right size but don't last very long if handled too much - and with kids, they can get worn out fairly easily.

All of the cards are uniform in size (3 x 5 inches), and the paper is thick and easy to write on.

These Mead Index cards are definitely a better, thicker, quality that some other generic brands.
