I have used this photo paper for a long time. The paper is thicker and more durable. This paper never jams in my printer. The glossy paper shows up nicely in a photo album. Otherwise, I love this photo paper. This paper is absolutely amazing with my Canon printer! Great all around paper, nice weight and thickness. It usually is suggested that one should use the paper recommended by the manufacturer. We got this paper for printing vacation photos for our album and to send to family and friends - the ones without the computer and email. I tend to like this better than the photo pro paper, which is supposed to be a better quality paper than this, but feels flimsy. I highly recommend the paper plus glossy. I've been using this paper for quite a while with great results. The Plus paper is so much cheaper than the Pro paper, that I would highly recommend you just go with the Plus.

And yes, it truly is the paper that makes the difference.I have tried other companies paper in my printer and can not achieve the same results.

This is the paper for you.

It seems that this paper is ever-so slightly rougher than the really good stuff.
