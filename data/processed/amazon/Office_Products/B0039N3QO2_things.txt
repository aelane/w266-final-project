Those things can become unsightly, and for those times when we use tacks for certain things, we always try to line up the hole, when we redo things so that there aren't so many all over the place. You can move things around easily, yet the tabs stick well and you don't find yourself fumbling and grabbing for the pictures, labels or charts midway through your presentation.I do some scrapbooking and found them to work well for the uses I needed them for which included temporary page positioning as well as holding pictures, labels, and things in place while trying to visualize alternate placements. These little things work GREAT! Though I've just been using them to put things on my wall, the package shows that they will stick on most flat surfaces including stainless steel, plastic, concrete, glass, wood and painted walls. These things are pretty incredible. Did you purposely design these things to fail after a couple weeks? I have also tested them on one of the most challenging things - normal 8 1/2 x 11 printer paper. I currently use the removable velcro things from 3M to hang up stuff all over my place. They work fine for most things, but there are some applications (like sticking one cardboard item to another) they just aren't suited for. I tried several things, and the less glossy they are, the less effective the squares. They hold things securely; you don't have to wait for glue to ry, or worry about glue staining papers. It holds lightweight things and unlike tape, is removable. I love these things. these things are great. Not bad, all things considered. I've used Scotch Reusable Tabs to mount things to metal cabinets and painted walls.

So just know while it is good for very small things the whole pack won't hold up any kind of weight.

There are two things in this world that never stop impressing me.

And I'm not talking about heavy things either.
