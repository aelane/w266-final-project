The medium is a nice size. the medium size is just perfect.Thank you so much, Amazon. These medium boxes are superb. The medium size is great for kitchen & bath items, toys, and other various items.My only minor annoyance is that before you begin to fill the box, the inner flaps tend to pop upward. I have the large and medium boxes. This medium size is perfect for all of those appliances and knickknacks that too often get tossed into the backseat of a vehicle or worse. These medium size boxes are now our primary storage for ornaments, garlands, lights etc.I ordered the medium and large versions, but since this product exceeding my expectations, I will also order the small version as they seem perfect for my vinyl record collections I refuse to get rid of! The medium would be ok, but the small measures at 12" wide. Using the medium sized boxes proved to be a cinch. The large and medium would be my choices for moving but the smaller size makes a great storage box for income tax stuff. I decided on the medium size because I thought they would fit in his small SUV better. The medium size is 16.625" x 18.125" x 18.75.
