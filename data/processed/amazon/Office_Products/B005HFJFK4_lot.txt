This one is heavy and reflects a lot more quality than the replacement. I did a lot of research before buying the Epson Artisan 837 to replace my aging HP 7410. If you don't need a lot of the functions on this printer there are cheaper ones where the ink is not at that price range. Not at lot of unsightly wires to deal with and you can put it anywhere in the room; you're not chained to your PC--you can even put it in a completely different room from the one in which you're using your computer. I don't know a lot of tech-savvy stuff, so I won't comment on the specifics of technical details, but the quality of everything I've printed, from documents to photos is exceptionally good. It does not hold a lot of paper at once, so if you're high-volume printing, you may want to find a product with a larger tray.The photos look very good, dry quickly and don't smudge. I actually scanned a lot of document into PDF so a ADF is a must in my book now. If you print a lot of black and white documents this printer will do OK, especially since it will print both sides, but you could save a lot of money on ink getting another printer. If you are going to use a lot of color, you might as well go ahead and order afive-pack of the color cartridgesas well. There is a lot of blue tape to take off and when you think you're done you're not. It looks a lot better than those that came from the HP too. I know there are a lot of good printers out there, but I have always been an Epson fan. We do a lot of printing for our business, both text and photos. Apparently a lot has changed in that time, as the quality on the prints and scans is superb. I've had a lot of printers over the years and this Epson Artisan is by far my favorite. I've used a lot of printers in 40+ years in the IT industry, just about every brand and type and I've personally owned several.
