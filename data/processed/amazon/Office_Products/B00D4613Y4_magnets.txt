The magnets are strong and secure the item to my filing cabinet well. The magnets are strong, and appear to hold well on the side of a filing cabinet. Then I realized the magnets and the split allow for saving of space if this is used against something metal like say a file cabinet. The magnets also allow for paper clips to attach themselves to the sides so they are easily found when needed. When you open it up, there are 4 very strong magnets. It's got strong magnets that keeps it closed, or you can open it and hang it on a locker or refrigerator. The magnets were so strong that every time I pulled my scissors out to use them, it would knock the cup askew just a bit. (The magnets are fairly flat, so you could also use the 3M hanging strips to attach it to a non-magnetic surface. The magnets that hold the split cup together are very strong. Folded together, the magnets keep it closed securely, the edges match perfectly, and it sits on my table top perfectly flat. Strong magnets hold it closed if you want it to be a cup with a divider in the middle. The magnets are pretty strong and can withstand a little slamming, though I would not recommend slamming too hard or it will send everything flying. It has very strong magnets and can be placed in a locker, on a filing cabinet or even on your refrigerator (which is where I have mine). It opens up and has strong magnets on the back, so it will stay put even when opening and closing locker doors. The magnets are very strong.I did put scissors in the holder and they stuck to the magnets. The magnets are very strong, and so is the material it's made of. The surprisingly strong slam-resistant magnets allow the two cups to stay in place. It can be stretched open with magnets on the back to place in a locker or kept folded up as in the photo and still has two separate compartments. The magnets are super strong and it hold firm even on doors that you open and close a lot (it's advertised as being for school lockers, but will work on any metallic surface). The magnets are strong, it looks nice, and is well made. Its magnets are quite powerful, strong enough to keep the two halves joined or to keep them attached to the inside of a locker.I think the holder is attractive enough to be used in a home office, work room, or even a kitchen. The magnets are really strong so there's no problem with it falling or sliding. Very strong magnets. The strong magnets will keep the cup in place (it's currently attached to my refrigerator) and can be used to store all manner of school supplies: pencils, pens, highlighters, paperclips, even small Post-It pads.
