The glue that my daughter got on the table (remember, she's four) didn't wash away easily, needed some goo gone. It is so much neater than glue, more useful than foam sticky dots, and you can roll it in curves & other shapes unlike double sided tape. Given I typically buy multiple glue sticks this shouldn't be a problem. This is definitely better than white glue in a bottle since that can make paper damp and cause puckering. Glue for glue it is more expensive than traditional adhesive materials, but it is well worth it if you can't wait for regular glue to dry OR you don't want to bother with tape. replacing glue sticks and double-sided tapes, you just roll this thing across where you'd normally apply glue/tape, then stick on the paper. It is safer and less messy than glue, and you can't really screw it up. It doesn't stick as tightly as glue, though - the adhesive dots are more comparable to Scotch tape or a strong Post-it note. This makes it a little more "forgiveable" than glue, but I wonder how strong it would be for heavier materials like thicker cardboard. Elmer's glue is just too messy (and can turn a nice looking paper into a water wrinkled mess! The glue stick? If you are still using stick glue to do projects, you really owe it to yourself to take a look at the Scotch Adhesive Dot Roller! The glue is in the form of many minute (&lt; 1 mm) semi-hard glue "dots" that you apply to a piece of paper and that flatten when pressure is applied to another piece of paper that you place upon the dots. I said the glue is permanent, but paper products used can be separated with some damage, particularly with thin or multilayered paper. The Scotch Adhesive Dot Roller is a great alternative to messy glue or double sided tape. It is far less messy than glue, very easy to apply and very easy to store. The Scotch Adhesive Dot Roller claims to be precise, smooth and neat, as compared to traditional glue. With glue, you tend to get spots where it is obvious where the glue was used. I love it no more sticky glue mess. The "glue" dots are in a tiny grid and not nearly as "gluey" as I was expecting. It isn't messy like glue or a hassle like tape. This is not as versatile as glue, however, as of course you can't get into small cracks or places with small surface areas with a roller like this. Much better than glue. Unlike glue sticks, it is mess free. I'd rather use glue or tape. Throw away those messy glue sticks that dry up after a few months. The glue is permanent, but you do have a small window of drying time so you can replace your photo or other items--if you make a mistake. Then glue sticks came out which seem like a great alternative but they have a habit of drying out quickly. Once you've used it, you won't use another glue stick or fold a piece of scotch tape again. I'll stick with Elmer's white glue for that. The glue is acid free and rolls right from the plastic case on to the paper. No dealing with plugged-up glue nozzles, and no sticky mess. Unlike regular glue (e.g. glue sticks), this adhesive dot roller is extremely clean to use as there's no residue. It is definitely much less messy than regular glue and the adhesive is quite good! Not as messy as glue or tape, one handed operation, and it sticks stuff together.Of course I don't know how much refills are yet, that could make a difference if the cost for those are high. It may be a little more costly than regular glue, but I think it is a fair trade off. With glue, you have to wait for everything to dry and sometimes it leaves it looking bumpy, changes the color and it just doesn't leave it as neat and as clean as you would like. So much easier to use than glue, tape, etc if you want to quickly apply to projects. I would describe the Dot Roller as an adhesive glue strip roller.What do I think? The glue is applied like corrective tape. The glue is great at bonding paper without over-wetting and warping it. It is between glue and tape. So it is not moist like glue is and will not cause wrinkles on the paper. As I said, it looks much more like the glue that's on a self-adhesive envelope.With anything like glue or tape, I always wonder a few things. I can totally see using it instead of glue for all sorts of things, and I really like that I can seal an envelope without having to lick some nasty-tasting adhesive. The glue is so thin, there is practically no dimension to it. Toss out your glue and get this! I found the adhesive to be like tacky glue but without the mess. I tend to think it dries more quickly than regular glue which is another bonus, particularly for an eager child wanting to show off her art.The only reason I give this product 4 stars rather than 5 is because it is quite pricey. You just roll it and it puts a strip glue dots on your source.
