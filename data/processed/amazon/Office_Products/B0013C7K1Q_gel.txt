This gel mouse pad has a fun design with a comfortable and functional gel wrist rest. The gel inside is supportive yet pliable at the same time. The gel rest is just high enough and just firm enough. The gel rest makes it very comfortable and the texture of the pad is great. The gel on this pad is so soft and non-abrasive! I was surprised at how comfortable the clear gel writs rest felt. I like the gel wrist rest a lot, too. This gel pad is very comfortable on the wrist. The gel rest and the mouse pad are designed for smooth and easy mouse gliding. The gel pad is comfortable although I prefer a little softer wrist pad. The gel is very comfortable with all the computer work I do. I have used different mouse pads as well as gel pads in the past, but have never found a gel pad as comfy as this one. It is very comfortable, gel filled but the gel is nice and softy to the touch. The gel part has water/ocean fading into sand, a very nice touch. Also, the gel is not a bright white like seen in the pic, it's more of a sandy white fading to a tan white.Overall I think I would replace this with the exact same thing if I needed to. The gel pad is smooth and soft.I'm not crazy about the artwork but this was a Vine sample so beggars can't be choosy. My only negative is that the gel pad acts as a stop or barrier at times, meaning I can't roll the mouse far enough to move the cursor to where I want it on my monitor screen so I have to pick up the mouse and put it at the top of the pad again.Nice product. I used to have this fabric gel mouse pad, it died of age, and I started shopping for a new one. The gel pad is comfortable and lifts my wrist to a nice level. I like the gel wrist rest - it's comfortable. The gel rest has provided comfort, and my only small gripe with it is that it elevates my wrist just a little too much - if it were just a little less thick it'd be perfect, but as it is it's still close to it. The gel pad on this pad is a perfect size and very comfortable. It is gel filled, but the gel is very soft and 'squishy' for lack of a better term. The gel rest is very squishy, but a bit tacky. There are "pleather" covered gel rests if you don't like the tacky texture of this type. The gel gets warm as you rest your wrist and certainly is much nicer than setting your wrist on a cold desk top.T
