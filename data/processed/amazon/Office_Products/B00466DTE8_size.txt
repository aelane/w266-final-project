Half the normal size of a regular binder. I have short legal size notepads at home and without punching holes in the papers, it wouldn't work.When I tried to use this with the notepads I had, I misaligned the hole punch and had to deal with the messy rough edges from ripping the paper off the pad. The smaller size makes this little notebook perfect for those of us who like to take notes the old-fashioned way with paper and pen. The size although is a plus if that is what you are looking for does make it a little specialized and I would have loved a starter pack of paper. You have to find a suitable size filler piper because it is a small binder. We already have Avery big size binders which we use for office and school purposes. I love the size of this binder, and it's very well made. I think this size binder would be perfect for an desk top address book because the pages would be replaceable, thus eliminating all the scratching-out and scrunching-in of information that always ends up on the pages of my desk top address book.Overall, if you have the need for a small binder this size - this binder would be fine for your use. The size is very appealing--just right to drop into your large purse or carry-on bag to organize that which you will do today or wish to consider tomorrow. This is a nicely made, half size binder. With that said, it's a cute size with much potential.The fully enclosed pouch on the inside left is great for a few small items such as pens, pencils, highlighters, a small ruler or calculator. It's the perfect size for tracking my finances and it has a convenient pocket on the inside cover for keeping receipts. * The small size makes it useful for carrying along to classes, or even for shopping, if you use it to hold fabric swatches and paint chips.CONS:* The rings aren't as high quality as other Avery binders I've used. The odd size would require me to either cut paper to fit or purchase paper specifically for it. This is a great size to take with you because it will fit easily into a notebook bag. The 1/2 size paper binder is VERY convenient for storing printed and folded pages of patterns. You would think half the size would be half the cost! The small size is very nice for household projects, recipes, etc. It's the perfect size to store pens, markers, a small pad, and so forth.

I like the size a lot, too; the compact 5 1/2" x 8 1/2" size makes it perfect for stashing in a briefcase, laptop case, or large purse, yet the paper is still large enough for taking reasonable notes.

The small size is great because it is easier to carry (slip into purse) and doesn't take up nearly as much room when open (making it easy to use while sitting in the car waiting, or at the grocery store).The construction is what I would expect from Avery, good enough to stand up to a certain amount of abuse, and not so cheap (like the generic brands) that the plastic starts to crack.The one problem I had with it was finding paper appropriately sized.

It's tough to find this size with large enough rings to hold more than a 20 pages, so I was very happy when this came available through Amazon.
