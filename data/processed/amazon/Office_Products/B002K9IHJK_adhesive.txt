The adhesive is great - far better than regular post-it notes - and is on the entire back of the product rather than just a thin strip across the top. The adhesive is more sticky than standard Post-It notes, and covers the entire back surface. Yet, it is still a removable adhesive, and will not leave a residue and will not damage paper or cardboard. The adhesive is also stronger than that used on an ordinary Post-it.I applied one of these labels to a smooth surface, then pulled it off and replaced it 10 times. The adhesive still worked, and my "smooth surface" did not become sticky or otherwise dirty. Perhaps this preserves the adhesive. This has no adhesive. I'm reminded of how much it takes to make an adhesive that releases after weeks - unlike, say, masking tape, where the adhesive drys and sticks and leaves residue unless you remove it before it drys. The adhesive is a bit stickier that the regular post-it adhesive, so they will stay put, but can still be removed with ease. (The adhesive coats the whole sheet.) The adhesive is similar to that of the super sticky post notes, so they work with a variety surfaces, but the adhesive covers the entire note itself. While the new "Super Sticky" adhesive is stickier than the old school post-it notes, it's nothing to dispatch a parade over. The adhesive is slightly stronger than normal Post-It Note adhesive, but I don't know that I'd go so far as to call it "Super Sticky" as per the product's name.I tried writing on these labels with a ballpoint pen, a black Sharpie, a rolling ball pen, an erasable gel ink pin (the Pilot Frixion), and a mechanical drafting pencil with HB lead. It appears the adhesive is identical with the only difference being the paper thickness, color, and delivery (sheet vs pad).The file labels comes on a thinner white paper.
