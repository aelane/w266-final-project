This is not a printer to be taken lightly and I mean that in a literal way! And since this printer is wireless, there is no need to interface the imageCLASS MF8280cw with the wired server of your office network. If you need to connect this printer via wired LAN, you have to change the setting in the menu. This printer's Duty Cycle rating is 30,000 pages per month! The printer pulls an IP address from my wireless router but that's as far as I was able to get with testing the wireless capability.In conclusion... this printer is too large for most home offices and the limited paper capacity makes it cumbersome for all but the smallest of businesses. I was able to get it onto my printer station myself, but two people would definitely be better!Once it's in place, there is the standard ritual of removing all the shipping straps. But I am going to have the printer connected by USB, so I put in the software CD. This printer is far from being a photo printer (I have an Epson WorkForce Pro WP-4540 Color Inkjet Wireless All-In-One with Fax and 580 Sheet Paper Capacity for that), but it does text copies and printing very well.There are some major downfalls in my opinion to this printer. I've never been around a printer that stunk so badly, or for that matter smelled at all.Printing speeds are up to 14ppm, but, again, no match for the Epson, which is 16ppm. Google doesn't know of this printer, so I had to manually set it up... Just like my Epson.So, really, there's no comparison, here. You'd expect a printer this big to have a higher paper capacity. I bought this printer about a year ago and tried for several months to make it work. The printer does not work.
