They are fairly sharp, and I would compare them favorably to Fiskars kids scissors in terms of quality and functionality. My kids liked the colorful handles, too. My kids use scissors every week for art and/or homework, and our scissors somehow mysteriously keep disappearing. The kids also like being able to pick their colors, and the 12-pack offers several options. My new favorite kids scissor! I don't have kids but I needed scissors to keep in different places for special projects that involve cutting paper. These seem like normal kids scissors. It is very easy for all kids to use without struggle. Nevertheless, teaching the kids to hold the scissors appropriately, even those scissors cut fine.As an additional note, the storage rack advertised on the box is not really any good for storing the scissors (just flexible plastic). The older kids would be okay with pointed scissors, but since these are used by all, the blunt tip is fine. The kids love them. I have bought my kids alot of school and dollar store scissors over the past 5 years. Unlike some kids' scissors, the handles are big enough for adults (like me, with my big hands), but quite suitable for kids. My kids love the colors. I use kids scissors so I don't puncture my canvas.
