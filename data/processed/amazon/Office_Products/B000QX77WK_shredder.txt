Needed a shredder for simple household use and this fits the bill perfectly. This shredder cheerfully chews up anything I feed it (that's allowed) and chews it fast. It sounds like any shredder. This little shredder lets me take it for granted. The shredder is exactly as pictured, and it does in fact make confetti style cuts which adds that little extra security to what you're shredding. My old shredder bit the dust and I wanted to get a new cross-cut paper shredder because a cross-cut is much better. This shredder has exceeded my expectations, especially for the price. It is also much quieter than the shredder it replaced. I have had this shredder for 4 months now & I have not had any problems with it & I have used it on a daily basis since I have had it. This shredder touts it can shred 8 pages at a time when half that amount is closer to the mark. This shredder has a reverse button that helps fix stuck paper. I've had this shredder for a long time now, & it's an amazing product. I bought this shredder after my stand alone shredder went kaput. The Aurora shredder has been through hell and then some with my constant over zealous shredding of credit card offers, confidential info and sensitive info, and it keeps on working. If you're looking for a basic cross-cut shredder, this one is awesome. I got it, immediately put it to work after oiling it (as should be done with any shredder, especially cross-cut units. It is slightly quieter than my previous shredder.

I personally love this shredder!

This is a crosscut shredder, not a confetti.

This shredder is a crosscut shredder, which means it shreds the paper into small pieces rather than in long, ribbon- like strands.
