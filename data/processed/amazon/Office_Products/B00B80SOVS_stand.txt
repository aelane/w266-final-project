And the stand would work even after the pens have dried up. The stand is very handy for keeping them organized and easy to choose the color you need. The stand on this set is perfect. The stand is nice to easily store the pens although it takes a bit of effort to line them up correctly to be able to place them in the stand.I love the variety of colors, but be aware there aren't 68 different colors. The stand feels a bit cheap at first, but when it's holding all of the pens it's much more sturdy. They work great I like the stand. The stand holds them conveniently and makes it easy enough to pick out the right one. The stand is nice and compact, and there are so many pens! But you could store these in the stand in a drawer and bring them out when using them. However, I didn't purchase these for the stand, so that does not affect my review of these pens. Also, I wish that the stand was a little more attractive because it doesn't take long for it to get dusty and to look shabby.All in all, great color selection and fun pens. The stand itself is pretty cheap and homely looking. I like the stand, and with so many colors they are fun to use. The stand makes it easy to organize them and see what you are picking out at a glance. As far as getting them into the stand, well its very easy. The stand is very sturdy and practical, easy to access for small children. Silly me, I thought they'd come in the stand but the pens come wrapped in two separate bags and the stand bubble wrapped so it wouldn't be damaged. The Stand: No, the stand isn't fancy or attractive and yes, it is a little awkward to put a pen back in when you are done.
