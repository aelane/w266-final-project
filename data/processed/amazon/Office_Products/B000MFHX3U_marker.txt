When using them to remove permanent marker, just making these a little damp is enough.Recommended!CFH Last but not least, I tested it on permanent marker on the dry erase board. They can also be used to erase permanent marker, but I haven't used them for that purpose, just for erasing my white board. Permanent marker takes a bit of elbow grease, however, and may not completely come off without wetting the sponge and scrubbing with both sides. - a few permanent marker stains came right off with just a little water and scrubbing. If you have a permanent marker stain, ghosting and/or residue just add water to the white side and these work like a charm. Surprisingly, it started to remove the permanent marker, but it was a slow process and there was a lot of smearing. And yes, it does get permanent marker off as well! I don't always have old marker stains on boards, but today I came across some that wouldn't come off with a regular eraser.

I don't know how, but they are more effective at getting the marker off my boards than my other eraser.

"Yes, it will take off permanent marker on whiteboards and on laminated plastic.

I also like that they don't leave the marker dust that you can get from erasing fresh marks.These only need to be very slightly damp to work.
