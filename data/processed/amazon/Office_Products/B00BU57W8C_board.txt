This white board was surprisingly good. This is a nice, large wipe board. I erased writing on the board and no sign of previous writing was left--Yay! The wipe board is magnetized. This board is nice to look at and it cleans up nicely, with just the swipe of a dry-erase marker eraser (or my hand.). The board conveniently comes with four stick pads for mounting, a dry erase marker with eraser on the lid, and two circular magnets. I've had the board up in my kitchen for about a week and despite the humidity and heavy traffic, it has has stayed in place! The board doesn't come with any tacks or push pins though, you'll need to purchase those separately. My board is getting a lot of use in the kitchen and I like it so much I am thinking about getting another for my office area! The Quartet Magnetic Calendar board has been a useful addition to my office. I would have preferred that the board came with either the tab pull mounting squares (which you can remove by pulling on a tab without damaging your wall) or even a picture hanger so that the board can be removed if needed.Bottom line, if you are interested at all in appearance, Quartet makes some much better looking boards with wood frames or even picture frames that would look a lot better in a home office or even a business center. I like that this board has enough room to create yourself a calendar for any month.The pen holder hardly gets used because I find it annoying. Overall, the Quartet board does the job its designed to do. The board is large enough to record appointments and other activities or a chore list for children. This is quite a large board. This board seemed to be the perfect balance of magnetic dry erase calendar with a small portion for pinning letters or important paperwork.At first sight and touch, I was disappointed to see that the frame was a very cheap plastic. The board erases cleanly and easily every time.
