The ADF leaves something to be desired as it seems very slow. I didn't want something that would take up a lot of real estate on a desk or shelf or that would require me to be in one stationary place in order to print. I also didn't want something that would be extremely expensive because I don't print from home often enough to justify something that is fancy. I love that I can be working on something on my bed and send it to my printer on my desk. If you need something that does what it says and is a good price this is a printer you might consider. Not something I do at the office, and I doubt I'll ever utilize that portion of the printer. If you need something easy to setup and work with this is the printer. There has GOT to be something better, and more cost-effective, than THIS out there!!! I just feel like I have to be careful or I can easily break something. It's nice to be able to print something from my tablet while I'm 30 miles away from home.Second, it's a fast printer! Not so the Epson, which uses something called "ABBYY Fine Reader", and while I am sure it works just fine, the learning curve is uphill.
