I use this board to write down what I need at the store and I put up the coupons (if I have any) on the cork section. When I go to write on the board, it slides down my door. But, if that doesn't bother you, then you might like this little board. This is a nice-sized dry-erase board with a cork edging to which notes can be pinned. The board comes with a dry-erase marker and has a clip at the top to store the marker. The board itself is lightweight and would be nice for a teen or tween's room or a dorm room. The board would work better for me if it was split horizontally, but that is not the fault of the board, but mine for &#34;choosing&#34; this shape. The Quartet Magnetic Combination board is a decent white board for the price. The board comes with two striped magnets for affixing items to the white board part.I was worried that the cork board would not be deep enough to take a regular thumbtack. If you look at the board closely, it looks like the white board fills up the whole frame and an almost paper-thin swath of cork board is laid over that. Otherwise, the board does the job it has to do, and it looks pretty good doing it. I'm not an industrial-strength white board customer. We paid $8.71 for the Board Dudes board, which is noteworthy since it currently lists for $14.71 (WHAT?) * The Quartet board comes with a cork strip that is tackable.In summary, both products are a value for casual use when priced less than $10. The board I received had a crease in the dry-erase portion before I even took it out of the box. I placed this board on my refrigerator and use it daily.Likes:- Combination of white board for writing grocery lists and things not to forget to take with me, plus the convenience of a bulletin board and magnetic board for those little pieces of paper or tickets that you know where the need to be.- Nice size - not oversizedI wish - I'd gotten a different color - the neon green is a little bright for me. If you just need a small board for the occasional message and a few small posted notes, this will meet your needs.The included magnets are a nice touch, and are stronger than I'm accustomed to coming from Quartet. So if you intend this board for heavy use, you might want to step up to the next price level. So, if you just need an inexpensive board for quick notes this will be good enough. The board feels flimsy and not very durable for daily use.At the current price of $6.76, I would rather pay a bit more and purchase something sturdier that will last long and stand up to daily use. This board is wonderful. I am far from impressed with this board and wouldn't look toward ACCO again for dry erase boards. The board itself is actually pretty cool. This board is perfect for a family and managing household duties, etc. If you need a small basic dry-erase board and don't want to spend much money, this should work just fine. The board includes adhesive pads and magnets, so it can be mounted to a magnetic surface, but I chose to just stick it to the wall. This is the second small Quartet board I tried and they both came with these really thin, flimsy magnets that barely stick to the 'fridge and are so weak they can't really even hold the product up. The board comes with sticky feet or screws to make placement versatile and easy and it comes with 2 magnets which are strong and will hold any list you want your busy family to see. The large white board writing surface is great for weekly grocery or to do lists and can be easily cleaned for new items. The board comes with sticky feet or screws to make placement versatile and easy and it comes with 2 magnets which are strong and will hold any list you want your busy family to see. The board comes with two-sided adhesive foam tape and magnets. we needed a small board for our computer nook off the kitchen (a modified pantry that now sports a desk, printer, 'puter, etc.

This magnetic board is average.

I would rather have all white board and no cork but I guess the cork adds something, maybe?

This board has a strip of cork which allows you to use a pushpin to stick photos, clippings etc onto it.
