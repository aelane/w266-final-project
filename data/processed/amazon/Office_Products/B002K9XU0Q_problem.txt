That creates a problem of having to stop, print new labels, and label the new files in the middle of a project. I had no problem with the label staying put until I was ready to peel it off. But that wasn't a problem--I found them very useful both for office work and home filing.Definitely recommended. Fortunately, my HP LaserJet 4100 doesn't have any problem handling it. No problem using the Mac or printing a few at a time and refeeding later for the rest of the page. The problem that I have had in the past with the words "Super Sticky" did not apply to these Post-It Super Sticky Removable labels. This is permanent and works well, but the problem always comes when I no longer need a folder with that particular name: it looks ugly to use white-off over it (correction fluid), and since it is permanent, I can't erase it, and I don't like striking thru it and writing it below (I'm too much of a neat freak): I'm not fond of pencil for this use, so I usually would end up throwing away a perfectly good folder that would be re-usable, because I couldn't re-name it: with these new REMOVABLE 3M file folder labels, PROBLEM SOLVED for me!I tested this, and I put one of these labels over the sharpie on a folder, and I could barely see it ~ with a new title written on the removable label, it's not really noticeable: now I will be able to RECYCLE and RE-use my file folders when I need to re-name them. The problem is, it's just as thin as the 3M competitor and anything you put over you can still see through the white sticker. I know this is a fairly specific problem, but I can see how they would be useful for many repetitive type tasks like this.I think the large full size labels would be great for scroll saw work, based on these file folder labels stickiness but I have not tried them. I don't see the opposite problem...drying out and falling off...happening either.

There isn't a problem with the bleeding of ink from the use of a fountain pen or a marker.The only downside to these labels is they lack a color band on top to help color-code / identify your folder contents.

I never have this problem with Avery labels but it was 100% reproducible with the Post-It labels.

It's a silly problem, I know, but that's what prevents me from labelling things, that I might Change My Mind later.
