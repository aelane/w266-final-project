The 2x4 size is sufficient with enough space to handwrite an address, or to include a 5-6 line address in typed format. They work, they're pretty cheap, they're a convenient size for most parcels... one thing I noticed was that the ink smudged when I printed on them, but I was using my inkject and they say 'Laser', so... probably not an issue if you use them as intended. They are really a great size for lots of things including address labels, name badges, etc. Dimensionally these are the same as the Avery 5163 size and thus are easily used with most software. The big size works well to use on boxes and storage boxes. This 2" by 4" size can be used for shipping purposes and to label household items or make name badges with.The labels come in a sturdy cardboard package containing 25 sheets. I was happy with the size of them for extra long foreign addresses, too.Since 3M labels are cheaper than Avery, I'll definitely be looking for them in the future. They are of standard size to work with any standard label template or software, which you can also download from 3M.They are made particularly for laser printers. You can adjust the size, color or font to whatever fits in the 2" X 4" label. The size is generous, and it allows for clear labeling of boxes or other objects. I recommend the 2" by 4" size because it really shows up and makes the job of the post office or shipping company easier. They are made in the USA, which is nice to see, and follow standard Avery size guidelines that you can find in MS Word. They are a good size so you can use them for a basic envelope or even a larger package. Perfect size, great price and they stick solid EVERYTIME!3M has been a  trusted name in office supplies for years and that's just one reason why I picked these labels. this is a nice size label. They are also a perfect size for writing addresses on. The size of 2 inches by 4 inches is perfect.
