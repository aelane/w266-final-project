The dispenser works smoothly, and it isn't terribly loud as it pulls off either. The dispenser works well. It also tends to stay in the proper dispenser path, which is nice, so you don't have to pull it away from itself as often as you would other tapes of a similar breed. Whether you find the dispenser a luxury (I do) and one worth paying for is ultimately up to the individual. I plan to reuse the dispenser with my remaining tape rolls. The dispenser is the same as all the old ones - it's the tape that is improved. The dispenser has a sharp serated cut-off blade and it holds the end of the tape from becoming re-stuck to the roll. The handy dispenser makes it easy to grip, pull out the tape, and tear it off without getting it tangled and stuck. The dispenser works awesome and cuts the tape great and I don't loose my tape in the roll which is a total pain! I would recommend a sturdier dispenser that you can refill. And although I say that the dispenser is not incredibly rugged/sturdy, the flip side of that is that it's very lightweight, so good for those who may have arthritic hands. Also the dispenser works very nice and clean. This dispenser is very easy to use. The dispenser is reusable and helps you to avoid losing the end of the tape when it gets stuck to the roll. Recommended and the dispenser was incredibly easy to use as well. I've always grabbed it by the dispenser on each side at the top of the roll, and it's all worked out just fine. As always the dispenser is solid, and the initial lead helps start quickly.For a comparison, the generic brand was weak, the open lead sometimes fell back on the tape (requiring a manual search for it), and it even smelled funny.Finally you can reuse the dispenser, if you buy bulk packaging of tapes in the future. With the Scotch Sure Start taping dispenser, the tape is easy to start, to use, and to cut. Once you've tried the Sure Start dispenser there will be no going back to those generic look-alikes. With a dispenser that works very well and has a nice sharp edge for cutting the tape.
