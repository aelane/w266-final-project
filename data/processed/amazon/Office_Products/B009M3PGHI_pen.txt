This is a beautiful pen. To make sure you can appreciate how beautiful this pen is, I uploaded a picture of the pen so that you can take a closer look. If you're looking for an affordable pen to enhance your collection, this will fit the bill nicely. It performs like a much more expensive pen. This pen, with either of the two inks above, will produce a good line on most papers, but if you see more feathering than you like, try a different paper. This is definitely a medium-point pen, as it makes a rather bold stroke, so if you are looking for something that has more fine-point characteristics, you will have to look elsewhere, but it is not overly bold, and I think it works fine for most applications. The pen is a cartridge/converter model, which means it comes with one ink cartridge, but also contains a converter to allow you to refill the pen with the ink of your choice. In all, a nice pen. I absolutely loved writing with this pen. I would highly recommend this pen to someone who wants to try a fountain pen.Instructions would be nice, though! I have really enjoyed writing with this pen. It's nice when the pen writes immediately upon being uncapped. The pen lays down a nice line of ink with just enough wetness to feel like you're writing with water based ink, but not so wet that you need to keep blotter paper handy.For the price, this pen performs really well! This pen has worked well from the beginning, no problem with ink flow. This pen, by the way, is much cheaper to use in the long run than the Varsity Pilot. While I like this Pilot pen, it won't be enough to get me to give up my Lamy.

The PILOT 91101 is an attractive pen.

It's a beautiful pen, a tad expensive, and I had to pay $10 extra for the special cartridge required for loading from an ink bottle.

The entire pen is made in Japan (surprise!
