I just love labeling things and organizing, so these were right up my alley. Still, these things have many uses. These things are awesome -- the stickiness seems to last forever! These things are good for alot more. So, if you're looking to label things, these are a good way to go...if you want something to write notes on, I would stick (haha) with your normal, good-'ol Post-It note. I LOVE these things! I use them for many things, especially for organizing my zillions of knitting books and supplies. TO make things easier, each of the labels has its own removable little flap, where there is no glue, so it is easy to pick it up from the pad, and you do not have to touch the glue while positioning the label. These things stick to all the surfaces Post-its traditional do well on - paper and . I'm always relabeling things and this is nice that these stick well, but also come off when you want them to. I love to keep things labeled, but I hate the sticky mess of white labels when I want to change things out. It's especially useful if you store things up high and use a larger, bolder marker so you can see at a glance if you need to pull out a stool and hall the case down. They hold on firmly.These things are tough enough to do duty as a mailing label without danger of accidental peel off in the mails, yet when desired they peel off cleanly enough to allow you to label valuable books or smooth items without leaving an adhesive residue or tear off damage after removal.

But seeing as these appear to be designed for things like long-term storage boxes and organization, and less for "don't forget the milk!"

They stick pretty well, and they are definitely removable, but like most post-it-note-like things the edges are harder to keep down after the first time you use them.

They are amazing for labeling things that could need to be rearranged later (pantry shelves) or things from which you don't want permanent goo to stay on if the label might need to be removed later (my grandma's recipe book).
