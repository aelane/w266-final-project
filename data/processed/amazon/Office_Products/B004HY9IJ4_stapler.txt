This is one impressive stapler! But other than that, this is as good a stapler as I've ever used. This stapler provides a soft and comfortable grip.It stands upright or horizontally, either way to fit your desk space.It staples more quietly between two to forty pages.The construction of this product is quite impressive. This should be a stapler that you should seriously consider for regular day-to-day use, especially if you have to staple things regularly. I was really attracted to this stapler because of the EZ squeeze. This is a very good stapler that is easier to use. I got as far as 25.Like I said, it's still a great stapler but some claims are exaggerated. I like this stapler a lot. This EZ Squeeze Boston professional stapler is the best stapler I have ever used. I compared this to the stapler on my desk that I had been using and no competition. I threw away my old stapler. This stapler is unbelievably easy to use, and can staple 40 sheets with one hand. The Stanley Bostitch EZ Squeeze stapler is a large, efficient stapler. I wasn't sure how different this stapler would really be from others. What I learned was interesting, and hopefully helpful to others.First, the stapler is easy to load and does a good job with the number of sheets it is designed to staple. I have seen some of these where you can actually pull the "inside stapler" out of the frame. You really can't do this with this stapler, it is too bulky. This is the best designed stapler I have seen so far. My current stapler has a limit of 25 pages that it can staple, but it uses standard staples. A stapler is a stapler is a stapler, right?

I like this stapler.

So if this is your first stapler you need to pick up a box of Standard S sized staples too.

This is an excellent stapler that easily lets you staple together 20 or mosre sheets of paper with a simple pressing down of its top piece -- no whacking/banging/squeezing that you often use with a smaller stapler.
