I was even more surprised to see that the pockets were not shallow. So often pockets are just big enough to fit the paper. The pockets are spacious so they do allow easy in and out access of your paper as well as accommodating small booklets.This is such a helpful system when your organizing a project. I would like to have seen interior pockets on the folder cover and last page. The pockets work great for receipts and estimates, product descriptions, etc., keeping things together and organized. on the actual pockets, as there is only space to write about one project on the front flap. Coat pockets, yes, but not footwear.Anyway, if you get a real thrill out of keeping your receipts in order, if when someone says "Can I see some ID," they actually can, and you don't sometimes mail your checkbook instead of the christmas cards, this is going to make you very, very happy. With 10 pockets, that's easy to do.c) It is fairly sturdy thick heavy cardboard.d) The tabs are large, and can't be covered with your papers, as folder tabs often are. If you need more than 10 pockets, you can always buy more than one.In my opinion, these organizers are much more manageable and convenient to use than individual file folders.

It has ten folder pockets made of heavy card stock, each labeled with a number tab and room for a more descriptive label.

The pockets also have a "notes" section and two quarter-size holes for easy removal of supporting documentation.

Unfortunately, the sleeve pockets themselves are not expandable.
