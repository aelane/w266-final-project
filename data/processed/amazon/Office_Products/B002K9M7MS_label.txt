A really nice label overall! This makes it very easy to use existing label software such as MS Word.A feature is that each page has a header and footer  - one in English the other in French (upside down). I wasn't able to reposition the label because of all the fibers on the sticky side. The label size is generous, which allows you to adjust font and sizing for occasion. Never have I been so thoroughly impressed with a label in my entire life and I kind sir or madam am now well over a quarter century in age, a healthy life span indeed when measured against your typical Liberian or North Korean!Well never have I beheld so rich and creamy a label before. If you are placing the label over other writing or a previous label, some of it will show through. If you're sticking the label to something like a bubble mailer, the thinness will help, but the adhesive is actually not that sticky. The label sheets also print easily with no problems. that the label is composed of is better than the old labels that we had on hand. I removed the label from it's backing and placed it on a box containing items I wished to mail.And when the rubber met the road? While the label bonded well with paper and was hard to remove, this was not so with cardboard. The label was easily removed from packages. They worked perfectly with my Word label software. There's not much more you can ask of a label. Good, solid dependable label from a name brand you can trust! What's there to say about a label? But if you want to put this particular label into a  printer,it will need to be a laser printer.I have a different need for labels, and these are perfect for  it. They're made of reasonably thick, very white label stock, and are made well enough that a previous address label did not show through. I was able to remove an incorrect label from my package (holiday mix up) a few moments after I realized I was sending my father the deluxe sewing box.Normally, I hand-write address labels, but that isn't exactly the most professional way of doing things. I was able to find the label template on the 3M site and used it to make labels for most of my holiday packages. I apply a label to the cardboard surface, and within a minute it's curling up. This makes peeling off label exceptionally easy. I put the label sheet in correctly and made sure it was lined up in my printer, but over a 1/3rd of the labels printed off the sheet, making many of them unusable. What makes a good label?a) White so the printing shows up.b) Sticky enough to stick to the package.c) Feeds through the printer and does not get stuck.d) And when you have to handwrite on one, it accepts the ink easily and doesn't smear.These are really nice labels. These were much easier to peel.I placed one label on top of the mailing panel on a package I received. It's the only label I've ever found that doesn't pull up, and the finish doesn't flake off the way some smooth laser-printed labels do, either.I'll be picking more of these up. Compatible with Avery 5163 label template.I used WordPerfect Office X4 to create my labels. 3M has been in the adhesive & label business for decades, and they know their stuff. I'm not really sure what makes a great (or not so great) label, but I'm happy with these. Thank you Amazon for letting me try these as I am now a 3M label fan...bye-bye Avery! They come in a 250 label per pack and they are just the perfect size of 2 inces by 4 inches. Just be sure to tab over twice to get to the label on the right hand side after typing out an address on the left hand side.I had no trouble feeding the paper through and printing out the labels. For the Avery 8163 label, I found that I needed to set the printer to thick paper/labels in order to print correctly. With the 3M label, even in plain-paper mode, the toner fused successfully. Now I can print right on the label, either by using 3M's handy downloadable template or the compatible Avery template listed on the package (and supported in my word processing software.) However, being able to print just one label from any one on the sheet is wonderful.Ten labels to a sheet.
