It is easy to verify if your printer says there is no ink left, you can check the cartridge. Fortunately, when the printer tells me that there is no ink left, there really is no ink left. The MX870 replaced this printer, and since I only use  OEM Canon ink cartridges I have had no issues whatsoever. My former printer had the printer head go bad due to my purchasing non-Canon ink which was supposed to work just as well. The printer head costs almost as much as the printer itself. Works great in my MX-860 printer. I use my Pixma printer to print documents and have done a little bit of photo printing. (My Canon printer takes a double wide Black and a regular black, but since I rarely use it for printing anything but photos, black is my lowest priority. I have a Canon MX860 printer and these ink cartridges are made by Canon and fit the machine perfectly. I've had this printer since April and this is the first time (september) I've had to change the color ink cartridges. I use my printer daily and this lasted longer than my previous printers.

I screwed up my Canon printer using an off brand.

However, if your printer fails early on because of off brand you are a loser.

I have a good printer and will just pay the extra dollars.
