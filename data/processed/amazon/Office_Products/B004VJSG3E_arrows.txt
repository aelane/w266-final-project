The arrows are see thru and easy to find places marked. Love these sticky arrows because they let you see through the label and read what's on the document! The arrows are bright enough and big enough that it's hard to miss them, but small enough to not be a giveaway.The surface is harder to write on and I found myself using my Sharpie Pens to do it. He thinks it's so "cool" to have the arrows pointing to things for him. And, these arrows are see-through, with the intention of highlighting something UNDER the arrow, right? Small arrows would be great for pointing to text. However, these large arrows are kind of a clumsy way to highlight text in a book.I HAVE found my own use for these, though. These arrows work great for that purpose. These arrows are similar to a vellum. The arrows don't obscure the writing on the page.

I've used the smaller arrows (often with "sign here" or similar) and sticky tabs for marking specific things on pages, but these are many times better.

The Post-It branded see-thru arrows I have can be used mannnnny more times than that.

These arrows are great.
