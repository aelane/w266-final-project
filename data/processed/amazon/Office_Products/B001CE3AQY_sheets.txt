It can staple up to 20 sheets easily. You can comfortably staple up to 20 sheets with minimal effort. (I stopped checking at 22 sheets, because the staples are not long enough to penetrate much thicker paper.) I stapled 20 sheets of standard photocopy paper (scraps) with great ease. I kept adding sheets and got up to 30 sheets stapled together, though the staples barely made it through. At 20 sheets, you don't need to use much pressure as advertised. At 30 sheets, yeah, you've got to give a little extra push, but I still used one hand. You don't have to count exactly 20 sheets before stapling. It does not consistently staple through 20 sheets of standard copy paper, but it managed to do it cleanly most of the time (I'd say over 90%), and it does it with very little effort.You cannot open up the stapler for tacking duties (e.g. It handles 15-20 sheets of paper with no problem and it IS easier to squeeze than a standard stapler. I found I was able to easily staple around 30 sheets of printer paper or 50 sheets of a catalog I had lying around. I used up to 25 sheets of paper and it stapled each stack with ease. My other Swingline can get through 14 sheets, but not without a slight bend in the staple. The Swingline LightTouch can smoothly get though 20 sheets without bending the staple.As for the 'Reduced Effort' description, claiming to be '50% easier', this is VERY misleading. I can staple 20 sheets of paper easier with the Swingline LightTouch then I can staple ONE sheet with any of my other staplers.I've read several complaints in reviews regarding the use of various types of staples.

This easily went through 25 sheets without a problem, and without any extra pressure or force to close the stapler.

It handles the 20 sheets it advertises with no problem.

It works well for 28 sheets, then the staples become too short to hold more.The box recommends using S.F.
