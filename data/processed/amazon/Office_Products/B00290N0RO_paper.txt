The paper is a heavy weight and quite solid. The paper is thick enough that corrections can be made without having to worry about the paper tearing. The paper is nice and thick, very good quality. The paper weight is quite nice for a range of media from pencils to paint. This paper is the perfect thickness--It's not too thick but also not too thin so markers don't bleed through it. So no, this isn't amazing great paper, but there's certainly a lot of it, and it does take a beating.So, all in all, if you are looking for a large sketchbook with decent paper and a lot of it, this is great. The paper has enough grit to hold color pencil work; yet it is still comfortably smooth. You don not get those wirebound paper tags when removing these large sheets of paper. This is heavy white sketching paper, just like it described in the description. Love how well the paper holds lot of color and stress without showing any sign of wear. The paper is very nice quality and it is great to have a sketch book in a larger format. The paper is heavy enough to hold up to normal sketching and erasing. The paper's texture is pretty smooth, but has enough tooth to handle various media such as pencil, pen, marker, pastel and charcoal. The paper was fine for ballpoint ink pen, lead pencil, Prismacolor artist pencils. The paper cost is on the high side so I keep my eyes open for paper to print on.... I am so happy with this paper! The paper is so sturdy and when applying color (colored pencils, markers, ect) it doesn't leak through. Good, it has great paper and is great for taking notes or just a quick sketch. The paper is crisp white and constructed of a nice heavyweight, also claims not to fade or yellow and is also acid free. Smooth paper which holds pencil well and inks well without bleed through. Just make sure you fold the paper along the perforated edge first, to make it easier to tear the page out.- CONS -* For some reason, the paper doesn't seem to erase very well. When I tested this paper, however, the erased marks were faintly visible. The paper stock has a really nice dense feel and there is a bit of &#34;tooth&#34; to the surface, a term used to describe texture in paper (I also print fine art photos on similar cotton rag matte papers), and to me it adds a dimension to drawing and even writing text that is infectious. The paper does get a bit wrinkled if you use water colors, but there are other books with different paper weight for that purpose.The 14x11 size is impressively and satisfyingly large. The paper is of high quality and will look good with finished work that I like. The paper is great and I love the size. The paper is of heavier weight, acid and lignin-free and lightly perforated. The paper is smooth, white (but not too bright), and slightly heavy (though not heavy enough for paint).T
