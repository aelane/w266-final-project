I was very skeptical about these little restickable shapes but after using them for well over a month now, I am seeing that they do keep their sticky well and stay put. These restickable shapes are perfect for hanging pictures! I removed and reapplied the shapes a few times and it seems like they continue to stick pretty well. These Scotch "restickable" shapes have a textured front which makes them easy to remove and restick. Scotch's restickable shapes for mounting are a great little product. The shapes are hearts, stars, and circles. The shapes about an 1" by 1" and can hold up to 3/4 lb without being intrusive or cumbersome. These shapes do not functionally stick to anything. The shapes will stick at first, but they peel off within an hour or so. I love these restickable shapes. I just wiped it off and reused it elsewhere.I recommend these little restickable shapes. We love these Scotch Restickable shapes. Fun shapes and enough to fill quite a bit of wall space when used at same time. They love the different shapes and that they can move stuff around. Second, you can use the shapes as you would a double-sided tape where you remove the plastic layer to expose the second sticky side. We also used the shapes to temporarily hold different project pieces in place. These restickable shapes are a very easy way to hang papers, photos on many surfaces. These double sided sticky shapes in bright colcors is designed to hold up pictures and posters (if you use enough). They have fancy shapes, so you can use them like magnets, over the top of the picture hung, or they can be hidden behind a picture, where they work like thick double stick tape. These restickable shapes work well for sticking artwork or photos to the walls with no damage. These little shapes are great because they're reusable and less damaging than the alternatives.You can either use them like a piece of tape so that the shape remains visible or you can use them like double-sided tape since both sides are sticky. I like the friendly shapes of a heart, star, and circle. I have used the restickable shapes primarily to hang up my granddaughter's artwork on the fridge and closet doors. They are fun shapes and are easily repositioned. The colored shapes make them fun for any age and are perfect for students and teachers at school as well as at home. I thought these restickable shapes would work well in my schoolroom. You can't see the shapes if you use them on the back but they stick well even on surfaces where tape or mounting putty doesn't.
