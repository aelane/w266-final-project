This one is much heavier and won't move when tape is dispensed. I had a good one and it quit cutting tape and I needed a new one this cuts tape very good .I like this because it is a little heavy to make it stay where you want it when you uses one hand to pull tape and cut. This tape dispenser does exactly what it is meant to do. I really like this tape dispenser's weight so it doesn't move when i pull on the tape. This is the basic tape dispenser that has been around for years. I put my tape into the dispenser, and the dispenser dispenses said tape. This tape dispenser is not heavy. One cannot remove tape without holding the dispenser.

I purchased my first Scotch tape dispenser in 1974 and it lasted for 37 years.
