The correct unit for laminating pouch is "mil", not "mm".If you follow the instructions exactly, laminating, even on the first try is trouble-free.The sealed edge must be inserted first, and the contents of the pouch must be pushed against the sealed edge for best results. While the unit felt warm to the touch (nice on a winters day!) The unit says it will do 10 sheets per minute. The unit feels well constructed and looks like a modern piece of office equipment (most laminators do not). This unit is solid and does the job...for how long...only time will tell. I know the unit says 60 seconds or something like that, but you really need it to &#34;heat soak&#34; for several minutes before trying the thicker laminate sheets.If you follow the instructions and KEEP IT CLEAN...you should not have issues. Let the unit process the material at its pace. The unit heats up quickly (1 minutes is about right) and will auto shut off if you forget about it. The unit is large so storage of it is my primary concern now.My wife is a teacher so she does a lot of laminating for school items and this one worked great for several signs I made for her classroom. The unit DOES seem to get a bit too hot for my liking though. I think this is a good, compact unit, that does not take up a lot of storage space, However, as with anything, I would encourage those seeking a laminator to do their research and to compare prices and functionality of several competitive units before deciding to purchase. Overall a very nice unit at a nice price.

Just have to wait for unit to warm up and slowly produce laminations.I believe there's little to nothing to learn and everybody can use this.

Even with the unit off but still warm, it is noticeable.
