This is a great hole punch. Finally a decently priced hole puncher that works great! You get three clean hole punches each and every time and there is a rubber bottom that holds the paper holes so you don't end up with little holes all over the place. Just hold the hole puncher over a trash can when you empty it and then it's not a problem. This is a very basic but well made desktop hole punch that will meet most most home or student needs, but might be under powered for use in a professional office.I like that the hole punch works smoothly, making it easy to use, and that it is lightweight yet very sturdy. This three hole puncher works like a charm. The hole punch looks underwhelming ... but don't let it's little stature fool you. This particular hole puncher has several things to recommend it. Granted there is not too much to a three hole punch but I have had some that failed within a relatively short period of time. A hole punch is a hole punch is a hole punch, but that doesn't mean there isn't room for improvement in the standard design.In this case, there IS a slight improvement to the standard three-hole punch, and that's in its so-called "low force design." What can you say about a hole punch? This particular hole punch dos it a lot better and easier than the one on my desk at work. A hole punch is only a bit more complicated then a tooth brush, some things just don't need to be made with a zillion features to work well. Our old three hole punch was a bear to use. I was quite surprised to see that this hole punch could cut through 12 sheets of regular printer paper like it wasn't even there. If that is important to you, then this is not the 3 hole punch for you. And it is probably the easiest hole punch I've EVER used! I love this hole puncher. This three hole punch is a light and sturdy product. This is a simple hole punch that lacks bells and whistles, which makes it perfect for a student and/or and individual that has a low-key home office. The hole punch can handle more than 12 pieces of paper - I did over 15 - but such an amount requires some heft. There always seem to be some still stuck in this hole punch. For three hole punches, I have two simple criteria I look out for. It even easily handled punching a hole through a plastic card so I could pin up a gift card on the wall over a thumb tack.
