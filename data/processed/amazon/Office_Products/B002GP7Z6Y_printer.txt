I have been using this printer for almost a year now. Reasonable printer while it lasted.Was used almost 5 days a week - only 3 to 7 pages a day on average.Drinks ink, ... but the generics work okay, so cost is somewhat controlled.Reasonably quiet, decent speed for printing and copying.Scans are fine and directly load into your email.Began misbehaving before its 3rd birthday (post-'terrible twos') - gave error messages requiring turning off the printer.Worked intermittently for a few weeks before finally refusing to print or copy at all. Great looking printer. Next I used the printer menu to setup the wireless LAN network from the settings menu. The printer pulled up my router ID, I then clicked the prompt on my desktop to detect my printer and setup was complete. Since my Dot Matrix Epson printer that I used up until my 2nd semester of my freshman year in college which was over 14 years ago, I have always bought HP printers never even considering another manufacturer. Additionally, the printer has two paper trays, a paper cartridge that slides under the printer and a rear paper feeder that folds out when needed. Another plus is that the printer can print double sided with no extra attachments needed. Coming from a printer with 2 ink cartridges I was worried 5 of them would be a hassle, but considering my previous Dell printer lived a long and well used life and then died suddenly, I had to upgrade just as suddenly. Until this happened I have been VERY happy with this printer. I ordered a NEW Brother MFC-J825DW printer to replace it, I will give them a try this time. This printer also works with Win7.I love this printer. This I turned on printer sharing on the computers and have to leave one on as a print server to work. I got this printer working on a Window 7 64bit laptop as well as a Vista 64 on my main computer without issues. You can keep the printer door close and when it prints it kicks out. I would not spend over a 100 for this printer. If this printer shuts down because one ink cartridge is empty then what good is it?I have always loved Canon printers but when you run out of color ink you can not scan or fax even though you don't need ink to scan or fax. I had an old HP all in one printer. I bought this printer when that one fell off the desk and broke while moving furniture. It is the most irritating printer I have ever tried to use. So much more complicated than my old printer. It is called an all in one printer, but does not include Fax. I found this printer to be just an awesome printer. As soon as I saw this printer at Gold Box Deal, I decided to go for it to replace my older HP photo inkjet printer for my small business. I ordered this printer to replace a much larger Canon that I could never manage to make wireless. This printer is awesome. Really, this printer is just incredibly easy to set up and use. (INSIDE of the printer, this is definitely cool)* easy set up (took me a couple of minutes to realize I had to take the large orange plastic caps off of the ink). The printer takesCLI-221(Cyan),CLI-221(Magenta),CLI-221(Yellow),CLI-221(Black), andPGI-220(Pigment Black).Note: The difference between CLI-221 (black) and PGI-220 (pigment black) is CLI-221 is a dye-based black ink while PGI-220 is a pigment-based black ink. The printer uses the is the dye-based ink for printing photos and the pigment-based ink for printing text. after the printer is done printing on one side of the paper, it flips the paper over automatically to print on the other side of the paper.- Quality PrintsBoth text and photo prints are very very good. The  first  printer we received from Amazon printed stripes. I have to get up and manually turn the printer off and on as needed. Then when I would turn the printer off, it would lose all the network settings. I'm giving up on this printer. Yes, it comes with printer ink cartridges (about $60 worth retail) but that ink is given to you for free with your printer by the manufacturer, as a starter, so you should not expect to or have to pay any retailer more for the printer just because it contains ink cartridges. I've owned this printer for about 4 or 5 years and I use the printer a lot but I have only had one jam which was my fault for not fanning out a new stack of paper before putting it in the paper tray. The printer recognized my Airport Extreme signal, but then Canon's "distance measurement" test claimed the signal was unstable and would slow down the machine. I have only had this printer for 1 week but have used it A LOT in that one week. The printer itself is perfectly shaped, just a box shape that makes it functional in a busy room. So far this has been a great printer, had to call Canon support to get my new Imac to go wireless, they had me up and running in minutes. This printer works well. I bought this to replace an older Pixma printer which was still working OK after four years, but I wanted to go wireless.
