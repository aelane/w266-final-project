Nothing special, but certainly cool enough if you want to have a spiced-up dry erase board. The little dry erase blackboard can be fixed to a surface in one of two ways:1. This is a very petite dry erase board. I say petite because I am more accustomed to a larger dry erase board and this one is the size of a standard piece of paper, which measures in at 8.5" x 11". Also, they will write on white dry erase boards too.There are two mounting options: one being magnet and the other being mounting tape. This dry erase board comes with large yellow, orange and pink markers but it doesn't come with an eraser for some reason. This 8.5 x 11 dry erase board come with both magnetic and foam tape mounts, allowing you to hang it on just about any convenient surface. They are very translucent, they smear far more easily than is normal for a dry erase board, and they fade fairly quickly. I really this this magnetic dry erase board and the neon markers. We have used several white erase boards over the years...this gets the job done pretty much the same it looks great. A dry erase board is a very handy thing to have in your kitchen. I love dry erase boards, I keep them on my fridge for making list and things like that for groceries until I make a hard list to go to the store and they are wonderful. So overall, good for what it is, and if you want a black dry erase board or just a bit of a sleeker look than your normal dry erase board, then I highly recommend it. The black dry erase board is sturdy, and the three colored markers that come with the product (orange, yellow, pink) show up nicely on the board. We do have other dry erase erasers around, but for people who might not already have one, it might be a pain in the butt to have to go buy an eraser. Also, I do not think that regular dry erase markers will work with the "black" board, so, when these pens run out, I am not sure how difficult it will be to replace them.

This dry erase board is about the same size as a sheet of printer paper.

This small dry erase board is magnet- backed so it can be mounted on any magnetic surface, for easy, hassle- free access.Most dry erase boards are white, so the decision by Sanford to offer a black dry erase board is certainly a welcome change.

I have long attempted to have a dry erase board on the fridge.
