Granted, Smead MO Records Filing Starter Kit contains nice color-coded folders (Moss Green for Financial Records, Lake Blue for Medical Records, Camel folders for Projects)with generous-sized tabs and a two-sided "Starter Kit how-To" with helpful tips, but the size of the kit does not justify the price. These are great folders and all you need is one pack or two, for your most important papers, the ones you need to get to quickly. The folders themselves are flimsier than I hoped, and not in attractive colors - which might be silly, but still, I'd rather have bright and pretty colors! For 9 folders, I'd rather have the plain manilla ones, which are usually sturdier, and use a highlighter or a colored sticker or something, and save the money. They are decent folders with a roomy area for labeling, and come in three different colors which is nice if you like color-coding when you organize. TheSmead MO Records Filing Starter Kit, Letter Size, Assorted Colors, 9 per Pack (11803)includes 9 folders, 3 each of 3 colors - blue, green, and tan; a sheet with 16 blank labels, a double sided sheet of tips. The folders are very sturdy, with a large space (4" x 1.75") for writing the name. It comes with 9 folders. These are great folders, but I don't see much appeal for them above regular manila folders. This Smead "MO Records Filing Starter Kit" is just 9 file folders and a pack of labels for the oversize folder tabs. Included are nine sturdy colored folders with an extra large space for labeling. These are just ordinary folders. The folders are scored to expand to about 3/4", the same as other standard manila folders. Other than that, if you already have folders and a filing system, you don't need to buy this kit. These folders are thin and not very sturdy. They are more expensive than most folders but it looks like they will stand up better to use. These are file folders with a wide tab. Personally, I write on folders, inside and out, everything from notes in meetings to phone conversations. These folders cost nearly a dollar apiece... why? The folders are thinner than comparable products. You can use any normal letter-size folders with the Smead MO filing box, so it doesn't make financial sense to go with this kit. There are 9 file folders and a sheet of labels. I literally have over 50 file folders that I peruse daily at work. Although you can write on the folders directly, a single sheet of paper labels is included to allow you relabel the folders.So why only 3 stars? I had assumed that perhaps these folders would be extra durable (hence the labels), but really all this "kits" contains is 9 file folders and a single sheet of paper labels. You only get 3 folders of each color yet they give 4 different examples for each color.Step one determine the categories from the checklist. I really love that these folders are sturdy and have larger than usual label areas. Fine, sturdy folders.

I used these folders to organize all my most important papers and put these folders into hanging folders. It comes with nine folders (three folders that are blue, green and light brown or camel) 16 labels and a list of ways to organize one's life.The folder are well made and have a nice sized label area. Some folders give you a small amount of room. The folders themselves are good quality, and the tab to write on is a bit larger than normal. These are marginally better folders offered at a truly exorbitant price.This is a kit of 9 file folders and a sheet for labels, that is currently priced at $8. They are nice folders and average labels, but for that price you could get a box of 100 folders along with about 500 labels from another company. There are 9 file folders in this "kit." There are nine folders in three colors with tabs in three different positions. The folders are made of sturdy cardstock and the space for the label is a little bit taller than usual to give you more writing space above the 8  x 11 papers it holds.

The folders are very flimsy and I come back to the fact there are only 9 folders in this kit.

The folders are barely large enough to accommodate certain types of papers.It's not that I think they're for show.

All this is is file folders in 3 different colors, a sheet of blank labels & a paper titled Starter Kit How-To.
