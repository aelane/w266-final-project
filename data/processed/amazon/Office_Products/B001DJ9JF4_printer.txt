I love this printer, even after 3 months of regular use. This printer also printed really good photos using premium glossy paper.-- I love the flexibility of this printer. Then, I'm accessing the printer throughout my house over my wireless network. Though you can also go fully wireless if you're not so lucky to have your printer side-by-side with your router, you have to at least do your initial set-up/install in the network mode. I do know that this printer is really working well for me and I'm very happy I have it. I sent one last night.This printer does it all, from photo printing to scanning, to faxing, to memory card reading. To top it off, it is a wireless printer too. It actually took longer to unpack the printer from its shipping box than it did to set it up. This printer does not have a touchscreen like the Artisan 800. To install this printer on my company laptop, I installed all of the Epson software and then configured the printer manually using TCP/IP printing in the Microsoft Add Printer Control Panel applet. Epson handled my other printer's issue perfectly, from my initial support call and troubleshooting steps to the personalized contact that they made with me via the web, email, and phone.Back to this printer...Overall, this is an excellent printer, backed up by excellent support and service.Wireless printing is going to change your world. While it may cost more for a new printer, in the long run, having wireless built-in to the printer will save you time and configuration hassles associated with the wireless printer adapters. I was really looking forward to it, because a wireless printer is perfect for my home and office. If you're looking for a great, affordable WiFi printer and especially if you're running Vista, the Epson WorkForce line is definately your best choice. The printer does make a high squeak sound when printing but I don't know if that's just because its brand new.I have it hooked up to 3 computers (one desktop and two laptops) and the wireless printing and scanning works very well. I do notice that the printer doesn't seem to have an auto-on/off feature so if your in another room and want to print wirelessly and the machine is powered off, you have to physically go and turn it on which is silly because the whole wireless thing is so you don't have to be connected to your printer. The printer parts are held into place very securely with blue tape to make sure the cartridge holders etc aren't bouncing around during shipping. I ended up connecting the printer via a network cable to my router, and after the printer was found, setting up the wireless from the computer worked first time.
