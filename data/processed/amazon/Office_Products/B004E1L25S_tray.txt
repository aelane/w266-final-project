The tray is solid, and looks very nice, high quality. Prior to getting this tray, I had always used a homemade sliding shelf under my vintage drafting table which I use as my iMac home base. The tray slides in and out under the desktop smoothly and with enough resistance that I don't accidentally push it away. The entire tray easily rotates to provide a nice arc of choice in terms of how you want to angle it. The tray slides easily and the tilt function is nice.I also like the separate piece for the mouse, because mice and keyboards are not created equally, and I like them at different spacing/angles than one long pull out tray would allow - and of course most of those don't even have sufficient room.For those who have an old desk they'd like to turn into a computer desk, this is a very nice way to do it.I do want to repeat though that I've seen standalone units for less money, which are mobile, and as more and more people turn to notebooks and netbooks this is not the right tool - and unless one is in love with their "old" desk, one can buy an entire computer station for the same, or less, than the cost of this tray.In other words, great product, but not sure that it really has a place in today's market.If it is what you need though, by all means, it is very well done and worth it. It's not as good as a true industrial tray from Hon or Global, but it's also about half the price. The tray is perfect and the ergonomic pads are outstanding. This adjustable tray helps -- making it easier on my wrists while writing articles or code. Since the tray pivots, getting the track perfectly aligned is not strictly necessary, and a single measurement from either side of the desk, half the width of the keyboard tray plus a few inches of slack depending on your desk size, should be all you need to do the rest by eye. It's positioned close to the tray, letting my hand bump into the bottom of it when turning.

Then the tray can be conveniently placed above the chair seat with a nob easily allowing to regulate the distance from the floor.

Once adjusted, the tray prevents stress on writs and back especially, if placed slightly below the armrests of the chair, so the elbows are not dangling in the air, but sitting out on the rests.

The tray allows me to keep all of my peripherals neatly & safely stored away while also keeping them close enough that I can actually plug them in.
