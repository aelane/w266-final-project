Within the package, theres a set of instructions on setting it up for Microsoft Word. This package of 450 labels are very adaptable, you stick them on a surface, preferably smooth and you may remove them with ease,even when applied to paper.They feature a website if you'd like to choose a template for labeling.They are made here in the USA and I also like that.The colors are a bright pink, yellow, lime and a turquoise blue color. The package comes with a two page direction sheet for using with your type of printer, ink-jet or laser. ("Super Sticky", the package says, and I agree!) )The package comes with instructions for printing templates. The package I received has 4 sheets each of the following colors:A bright pink (however not what I would call neon)Strong solid yellowLime green (bordering on neon)Pastel blueI took one label on and off surfaces 8 times. In this package you get four colors of removable labels: blue, pink, yellow, and green. The package has a lot of labels, so it works out to pennies per label, and I can probably handle several of my labeling-project needs with this generous package. In total there are 450 labels.The package includes printing instructions, including templates to use (one is available on the post-it website, the other is a pre-installed template in Microsoft Word.
