The push pins are colorful and fun to use. These colorful &#34;push pins&#34; almost the same size as real push pins and they have a very strong magnet for their size, so they can hold up more than you'd think. It is correct, these push pins are using high power magnets. These Quartet magnetic &#34;push pins&#34; are more than strong enough to hold up a stack of three 8.5&#34; x 11&#34; sheets of paper on my fridge. I like that they look unobtrusive  (like push pins) but can hold a lot. Two of these virtual push pins will easily hold your little one's 8&#34;x11&#34; report sheet or art project, or 4&#34;x6&#34; photo print to the fridge. I have some smaller black and white &#34;push pin&#34; style magnets on my fridge. These magnetic push pins are great! These magnetic push "pins" do just as they're advertised. They are small (about push pin size), colorful, and strong enough to hold up a few papers at a time. )They don't look exactly like push pins, since the base is shorter and they're larger overall than a standard push pin. I've gotten addicted to the magnetic push pin magnets for our refrigerator postings.
