I would have loved this workbook when I was this age. instead of calling it a workbook, it seems more accurate to call it an activity book or a playbook.i must admit that the coin section was a nice addition. Mead's "Number Stories" workbook is an economical and fun way to build your child's math skills at home.This full-color workbook uses multiple senses to help your child learn. This workbook, Number Stories by Mead, is a "learning numbers" workbook. This is a comprehensive workbook for a child who is beginning to learn how to write numbers, recognize numbers, count, learn basic math skills, etc. Overall, it's a really well-organized workbook, very clear and simple, not too busy (so as to cause distraction), but still attractive to work through. The workbook has activities such as:-learning how to write numbers-counting using search and finds-Addition-Subtraction-Graphs-Learning the numbers on a telephone-Counting money-Learning how to tell time-Using a ruler to learn about inches-Going around the house and counting various items-Counting to see how many sit-ups, jumping jacks, and crabwalks your child can doMy niece is a first-grader so some activies, like writing numbers over and over, were a bit boring for her. This workbook is perfect for kids 5-7 yrs old. This workbook is clearly written in steps like how to hold the pencil, sitting in the right posture, holding the paper while working on every sheet... The workbook starts with activities like writing practice for numbers 0-9,searching, counting and so on. This is a fine workbook for little ones learning their numbers, but it's a bit of a misleading title. THis workbook is the first I have seen that goes beyond the typical dot and arrow configurations and uses a descriptive phrase to help with the flow of writing a number. She loves this workbook. She worked through the workbook in a couple of days and is asking for more. Well done workbook, overall.S
