It seems like on-line software was thrown together. The older software you downloaded was better, but srill needed some work to refine it. The Avery software sequentially numbers tickets automatically. I have Avery software on my old PC, but had to use the online software for my Mac. The software itself is easy to use and lets you upload your own images. The software is not entirely intuitive - for instance, the number on the stub does not automatically match the number on the ticket unless you manually set both to the same starting ticket number. The software is really quite powerful, and I had fun changing around the tickets.The other issue I had was that using my Canon MX882, I found the top of the tickets was cut-off since it was outside my printable margin. The software has the ability to adjust alignment by moving the whole design up, down, left, right, but if I adjust it down, then the bottom tickets fall between the perforations.This a nice product that definitely gets 4 stars, but I'd like to see an update to the software to make alignment a bit more user friendly, and a version that includes a heavier card stock. The software is pretty easy to use and it prints easily.But you do have to spend time creating them and print a test page (to make sure it lines up). The software gave me several choices for designs I could customize, or I could start with a blank ticket.Printing was a little tricky as the program previewed the PDF in my internet browser, which didn't print the right fonts or line up the tickets right. On the software, there is also an option to insert sequential numbers on your tickets so that each raffle ticket has a different number. Since the software lets you rotate elements at any angle, it's very easy to put sideways text or sequence numbers on the stub.
