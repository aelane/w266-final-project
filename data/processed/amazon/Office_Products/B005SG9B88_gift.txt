I put my gift in and handed it to them. It made their gift more festive than the way I usually hand them their presents. I think it was the gift inside that made them smile, but the card was a nice touch. If you are sending gift cards for Christmas, this is a nice generic greeting card & mailer all in one.What you get:Two plain white envelopes.One red mailer with a white snowflake pring.One black mailer with a colored Christmas light print.The mailers have a space for you to write a greeting message and a slot to insert a standard sized gift card. This was perfect to contain a gift card.The product is sturdy and has ample room to include a letter or note.Easy to insert a gift card into the ready slots so it's held in place.Much nicer than the gift card products we've used in the past. I would much rather give a gift card in a typical greeting card, or I could give the gift card in the generic Christmas cards folks tend to use (which would cost a small fraction of this price per unit).On the other hand, if you really want a card designed specifically to carry a gift card, and don't mind the generic style (in this version, you have a red card with white snowflakes, and a black card with colorful holiday lights), then this is exactly what you wanted. It makes the gift card look spiffy and you just write on the message part, close it up, put it in the evelope and you have a cute gift card sender. Sometimes giving gift cards is kind of, boring. I'm carrying around two gift cards, one from a restaurant and the other from Trader Joe's, and both card holders are of a better quality paper than theQuality Park 2-in-1 Giftcard-e-lope, Giftcard Mailer with Greeting Card Built-In, Assorted Holiday Decorated Designs, 4.5 x 6.3125 Inches, White Outer Mailing Envelope, Pack of 2 (65020). The GIFTCARD-E-LOPE is a gift card holder that dresses up an ordinary gift card and makes it more festive. I used one of these to send a gift card to a friend as a gift. I'll probably just reserve it for in-person gift giving.Overall, not a bad idea, but I wasn't confident it would work (and didn't want to test it...). As long as you are careful though I think they should be adequate gift card holders.The assorted holiday designs I received were: 1 black with multi-colored christmas lights on it and one red with white snowflakes on it. I did put a gift card I have in it and put in envelope to make sure how it would be when mailed. You simply tuck the gift card into the slots on the holder, fold it, and place it in the white envelope before mailing it. While the gift card envelope has a special slot for the gift card and space to write a personal note, they're just too bland and generically decorated to be something that I would want to use to send a gift to someone special. Besides most gift cards come with little mini envelopes too, so use one of those in addition to a personalized greeting card and your gift goes so much further. This makes giving gift cards a lot easier and a little classier. It is small (4x6) and although it does hold a gift card, it could't hold much else (like if you wanted to include a note of some kind, or throw in a few dollars as a gift).The envelope is thin and fairly transparent and I think if anyone saw it in the mail box, they would know what it contained. This is a basic gift card holder, made of heavy card stock. Basically it is a gift card holder with envelopes. I put the gift receipt there. This gift card  holder has high quality cardboard and appealing designs. It is easy (and more meaningful) to slip a gift card into one of these and write a personal note to go with it. These Greeting gift card mailers are colorful, nice looking and holiday/Christmas festive! and you place a gift card inside the flap: there is also an inner envelope where you could put a note or letter, or insert the gift card for safekeeping!
