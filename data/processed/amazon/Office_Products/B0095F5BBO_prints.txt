The B&W; prints from the Pro-100 are also beautiful, but when held to a side-by-side comparison with B&Ws; from the Pro-10, the pigment system's superiority in the blacks becomes apparent: Deeper, richer and cleaner. Put one of these prints in a frame with a big price tag, and nobody will question the quality. Some prints take 5-10 minutes depending on quality and media settings. The Pro-10 prints fine with a USB cable even when the WiFi driver cannot be found.PHYSICAL:The Pro-10 is very heavy and very large. The prints on the Pro-10 were much crisper and sharper. I noted that on the glossy prints, if the light hits them from a certain angle, you can detect the paper shuttle points on the page. The MG prints photos I'd be comfortable putting into an album or giving to a friend or in-law. The Pro-10 prints photos that I'd hang on my wall. When you feel you are getting perfect prints, save the settings as a preset (I use lightroom for this but the canon plugin allows for essentially the same thing) and use it as a starting point the next time. I feel almost guilty just using it to print 4x6 prints for scrapbooks and 8x10s for desk photos.The color rendition, like all Canon printers that I've experienced, is spot-on, and the ink consumption, like all Canon printers, is ravenous. If you need/want to make your own prints, the Pro-10 will do a beautiful job. It still produces absolutely gorgeous prints that are difficult to distinguish from those produced by high-end photo labs.This is a big, heavy, extremely solid printer. It's too bad it can't make 16x20 prints, which seems to be the most popular size for art prints.The set of ten ink cartridges feature three monochrome inks and a chrome optimizer, which produce spectacular black and white images. Once I get a few more prints out of this (and find a more permanent spot for it), I'll revisit with some more impressions. to create prints that are as good as I can get from any commercial service bureau. My border-less prints are gorgeous and my family is very happy with what I have been sending them. I look forward to trying more prints, especially at the full 13x19 size.

Trying to get matching prints and screen image usually entails extensive monitor calibration, which in my experience means I'm looking at what I consider to be a pretty dark monitor image.

To me this is a non-issue, but there it is, FYI.Color prints:  Both printers produce color prints that are absolutely beautiful.

To me, the prints from the dye-based Pro-100 seem to "pop" just a bit more, probably again due to the physical property differences between dyes and pigments.
