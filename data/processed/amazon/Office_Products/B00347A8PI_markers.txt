I'm used to the Sharpie ultra fine markers, and those definitely feel sort of draggy on the paper, but these do not.The grips are a nice size. I'm enjoying these markers very much. These markers are ideal for writing or coloring with great detail special small-scaled projects. The markers write well on hard surfaces without smudging after a brief drying period. The markers are indeed very fine, but they still draw bold, bright colors. I like to use markers for posters for my classroom, but thick tips make it hard to do detail work. With these markers, however, I don't have that problem, I was making gifts for a friend, where I wanted to write out these labels to go onto the jars. I love these markers. Although I received the ultra fine markers through vine, I have also purchased the fine tip set on my own and will continue to purchase these in the future. I really love these markers. As with all markers, the more popular colors will run out of ink before others, but we haven't run any dry yet. I found the markers to be really easy to use, comfortable in my hand and of fine quality. I really love these markers! The Bic markers are fabulous. The markers stay put in the pack that can be opened up and set right in front of you when you are using them. BIC makes terrific permanent markers, but usually one is limited to black, blue, red and (maybe) green. I want to use the markers in a variety of projects, and color selection is important in some of these projects. Some "permanent" markers aren't so permanent, but these seem to be, so far. We've enjoyed using these markers to color with and decorate/embellish some felt snowmen and snowflakes around the house. Like all markers they will bleed through all but the heaviest paper.All in all these are a decent set of markers that could have been better. These are the best markers that I have used in a long time. These markers dry almost instantly so no more colored hands when trying to write. These markers are very sturdy and have a rubber grip so they are comfortable to use for long periods of time. And these markers perform very satisfyingly for that task. There are markers in craft stores that, while more expensive, will color smoother and stronger than these will, on surfaces such as glass, ceramic, or plastic. The markers are very good to take notes and also to draw very fine lines. The markers have a soft rubbery grip, which makes them easy to hold. I really love these markers. The markers are comfortable to hold, easy to write with, produce a fine line, and do not drip.3. These markers are for hobbyists. Usually, coloring markers are a bit thicker.The best comparison to make is to the Marvy markers that hobbyists are so familiar with. Marvy markers can be watered down, they can blend into each other, they have two points so you can easily color larger areas, and it is possible to achieve a watercolor-like appearance with Marvy markers. I love these markers! These are very good markers. No more loose markers roaming around.
