Great color selection and nice storage container to keep markers all together. I love creative color names! The BIC color collection is a great assortment of permanent markers in a reusable clear case.The three tray packaging makes it easy to locate the color you're looking for and takes up minimal space.The pens work well, although they are not as durable as Sharpie markers -- but they're also much cheaper. How excited I was to get this color set! Be aware that the color will penetrate some surfaces, paper for example, so be sure to protect the surface you're working on; for this reason, using them in a coloring book won't work unless the other side is blank or you don't care if you ruin it. Pretty much any color you could need is in the set. Every color shows up excellently on any surface and is definitely permanent. This may enable you to draw or color with greater precision.2)The variety of colors: If you need a lot of options in a convenient pack, this 36 count marker pack will likely fulfill your needs.3) Convenient case: The case that accompanies your markers allows that to be securely fastened in one place. And I noticed that the color does not rub off and dries quickly, which means I am not getting any transfer of colors on my little pinkie as i rub over any piece of work that i am working on. Different color dots denote different categories of files and various important dates associated with those files. A full color selection and a durable marker. I needed a huge color pallete to work with some plastic films I need to color (just trying to make guitar picks). The color quality is great, and there are enough shades/variety that you can really have subtle differences in your work if you are doing something artistic.

The color swatching for these pens is "off", to say the least.

Great color density, great color quality, and the color that these produce has proven to hold up well over time!
