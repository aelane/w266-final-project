Taping labels to boxes was time consuming, so printing these out and then sticking them to a box makes it easy. These labels are great. You get two labels out of each sheet, with no remaining leftovers on the peal-a-away. If you need nice clean large labels; this is the product for you.Side Note: I will say when printing FedEx tags, you will end up wasting the lower tag to non-ship data. You need to cut the labels to size.Can be really hard to peel off after you cut the labels. These labels work wonders for my shipping on e-bay/amazon. The labels completely adhere to plastic or paper packaging which is reassuring. The labels are a very good thickness, have durability, and work like the common name product &#34;Av..y&#34;. I ship both domestically & Internationally, and these labels work great for both (with the ready made customs form by Endica postage). These labels are perfect for these options so you can easily print 2 labels per page. These are good labels. These labels are worth the price. They cover up other labels and run through my ink jet printer with no problems. These are probably the most adhesive labels I have ever bought before. So glad to actually have labels that stick- and are a great price! I have been using these labels for a few weeks now and from my experience they work great. I used to buy Avery labels and cut them in half. These labels are decent with enough "stickiness" to work fine. These are no-name (unbranded) labels. labels kept getting stuck in printer, lost so many to damage
