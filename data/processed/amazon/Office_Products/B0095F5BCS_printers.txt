I have several Canon printers:Canon PIXMA MX432 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax, aCanon PIXMA MX512 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Faxand even aCanon PIXMA Pro9000 Mark II Inkjet Photo Printer (3295B002). They are huge and heavy, much bigger than Epson printers that output equivalent sized prints. I have used Epson printers that are similar to and in the same price range as this Canon printer. I've also had, and since discarded, a few Epson Work Force printers via Amazon Vine. The Canon printers have always performed at the level I've expected and the Pro 100 is no exception.It was with some excitement that I was offered the Pro 100 to compare to my current models.Printer was installed on a Win 7 64 bit based laptop with 8 GB RAM.Setup-Instead of using the enclosed CD for software installation, I decided to download the drivers and software directly from Canon's website. For those that can afford both printers, the ink tanks for both and the large amount of space required, I can see that someone might actually make the argument to use both for different photos. How disappointing to find that the recommended printers fail to deliver realistic and vibrant color images. Our other printers use a USB setup, but this time I decided to try the wireless mode.

But those two printers cost two to three times more than this Pro-100, so this Pro-100 may be totally sufficient for most amateur photographers unless, again, most of your photography is black-and-white, in which case I would recommend the Pro-1.

Dye-based printers just have a slightly different look and feel than pigment-based printers.

I currently have 2 printers that I use for my printing needs.
