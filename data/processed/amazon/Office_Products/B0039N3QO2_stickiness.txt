When their stickiness fades, simply wash with water to restore.According to warnings on the back of the package, this product "may stick aggressively to some surfaces" and are "not recommended for use on wallpaper, delicate surfaces, or walls painted with flat paint." The stickiness of the tabs even came back after I washed them with soap and water and stuck a tiny corner to my printer to allow them to air dry - something I didn't think would actually work, but it does!I also tried using these to hang a lightweight fabric hanging (single layer of woven cloth, no backing or lining to weigh it down). The stickiness can obviously only go so far, and weavings are beyond these tabs' adhesion capabilities.Overall, these are a great alternative to simple tape or those double-sided sticky foam squares which leave a mess all over your walls. I loved that the stickiness actually DOES come back post-washing! They are reusable, although their stickiness seems to be reduced by around 10% on each usage.
