I highly recommend this product. This product page indicates only Packaging, without the shipping. Have I therefore received a superior product, capable not only of packaging but also of shipping? Don't hold that against the product though - it is not necessarily intended for sealing small packages. The product I used previously was from the Post Office, came with a blue plastic holder. I am always surprised a seemingly unflawed product can be improved upon but you did it. This is the product I turn to first for storage and moving. This is a great product, almost too sticky sometimes. I think it is a great product. I found this product very hard to use. Very good product. This product is very easy to use and secures the packaging well. Scotch won't let you down with this product. If there's one product on which 3M has built its reputation, it must surely be adhesive tape.This Scotch Super Strength Packaging tape does not disappoint regarding its strength and itsadhesion.
