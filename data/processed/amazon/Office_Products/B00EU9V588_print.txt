We have cleaned the print heads. We have aligned the print heads. Once done, the print was perfect to my eye and looked quite uniform under a magnifying glass.I printed photos from an SD card and also directly from my two different cameras (using PictBridge). I had just started a time-sensitive print job (I don't print much) when suddenly the levels of ink remaining flashed on the computer screen - like a warning. Be sure that the print output tray is opened before starting a print job, as, unlike the XP-810, the tray will not open automatically by itself. I tried cancelling a print and the printer just sat there forever "cancelling" until I shut off the printer. The print is crisp and clear and it's big but it isn't huge. I scaled back my print ambitions and got an XP-600 and once again, after a year and no more than 500 pages it jammed, stripped its gears, and was dead. Following a quick print of the test page I used the front of the printer to set up the wireless part which was easy enough despite this printer not really having a true touch screen like the artisans have.I used the same disc on my laptop to install the drivers there and it asked if the wireless printer I intended to connect to was already set up. Setting up scan and remote print was less stellar. The email/remote print tested out ok.The instructions are rudimentary at best.

The HP print was far less brilliant and contrasty.

The Epson print was much bolder and had better contrast, with darker darks and lighter lights.

Neither print looked a lot like what was on the screen, of course, which is to be expected.
