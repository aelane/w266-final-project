He has been using these binders to keep his paperwork organized and in order. Unlike some of the other binders, this one has a plastic layer that doesn't bubble. These binders are perfect for storage. These binders are available in many sizes and colors. I use binders in my career as a teacher all the time, and I like binders that are sturdy and are easy to use.This binder is of solid construction, it has a sleeve on the outside that you can easily use to label the binder, and change whenever necessary. I also need large binders to avoid having to split up graduate seminar materials in three different binders. I use binders quite a bit. I also use binders in my work, stacks of them. As it currently is, one of these binders for $8.99, you are better shopping elsewhere. When purchasing binders, one needs to consider the use you have intended for them. The binders I still have that work perfectly are the canvas ones I bought 10 years ago.

These are perfect sized binders for storing an assortment of papers I use for my research.

I've bought better binders for half that price from an office store or big box retailer.
