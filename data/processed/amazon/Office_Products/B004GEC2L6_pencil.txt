The pencil is surprisingly lightweight which is a plus when writing. This mechanical pencil has it all, and at an amazing price. The BIC pencil was easy to write with, but a little delicate to the touch. While I am not a mechanical pencil connoisseur, I was neither excited nor disappointed by the pencil. This mechanical pencil looks like a traditional pencil but is made of plastic. These are not delicate though and write like a regular pencil. Is a nice inexpensive mechanical pencil that does the job it was designed to do. I write so much that it's impossible to keep a regular pencil sharp, so I always use mechanical pencils. This pencil is perfect for me. This pencil's .9mm leads give a line like a regular pencil that's just been sharpened and then used to write a sentence or two. They're what you'd want and expect from a mechanical pencil and i would recommend these to everyone. The BIC mechanical pencil is a nice replacement for wood #2 pencils. The mechanical pencil feels good in the hand, writes smoothly and once started, the graphite advances quickly. I tend to grab a pencil at that spot and it is a bit uncomfortable against my fingers. I usually lose the pencil before I get to the spares, but it's nice to know that they're there.P.P.S. I don't recall having even one bad pencil in any other batch of BIC pencils I've purchased.P.P.P.S. The pencil's grip on the lead deteriorates over time, and the lead slips back into the pencil housing. I really like this pencil and it beats using one that has to be sharpened. They work as well as any mechanical pencil, and I have minimal smearing with them. This pencil is fantastic and by the far the best mechanical pencil I've ever used because the lead is high quality and doesn't smug if you accidentally brush your hand against it after writing. 2 pencil. in pencil. I resisted using a mechanical pencil for a long time because the lead broke too easily. I got tired of sharpening my pencil as it wore down and I especially disliked my students having to interrupt class so they could sharpen their pencils. This pencil should not be to blame if that does not happen.The line drawn by this pencil is similar to a #2 pencil with a not freshly made point. BIC Student's Choice pencil has a classic wood case. One BIC pencil = 2 1/2 wood case pencils. I even had to purchase a powered pencil sharpener as we do go through a lot of pencils with homework. I know, not practical anymore when pencil sharpeners are getting harder and harder to find. I'm so glad to have found an automatic pencil with thick enough lead that I could scratch through three layers of paper without breaking the lead. I also found that if you press too hard on the pencil, the lead gets pushed back into the pencil. So I figured, I'd buy her a good, expensive mechanical pencil with lead that boasted it was hard to break. This expensive pencil did no better than any others she tried. This pencil is reliable and I haven't broken the lead once, so far. I don't carry a pencil sharpener with me, so wood pencils are for home use only. This .9mm pencil is sturdy, the eraser provides swift and clean erasures. This is a useful and practical pencil at a good price. They made a wooden mechanical pencil! They look just like a wooden pencil, but they are a mechanical pencil made of plastic. If you like using a mechanical pencil but want the feel of a wooden pencil you will really like these BIC pencils. The BIC mechanical pencil seems to work just fine as it should. They will smear but not excessively.Overall this mechanical pencil seems to be a good buy with no down side that I can see. What can I say about a mechanical pencil that isn't already known?

We had pretty much given up on finding a good mechanical pencil for them and had just gone back to the standard No 2 wooden pencils.Then we received these Bic Students Choice mechanical pencils, and I can definitely say the name is appropriate!

But, a pencil grip is an easy solution to that problem.All in all, I believe we have found a new favorite pencil, both for my "students" and for myself!

I prefer this pencil, because the lead is thicker and it's easier for students to bubble in the scantron book and students are not up and down because of pencil lead.
