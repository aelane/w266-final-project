I am fairly particular about tape and believe you definitely get what you pay for, regardless if you are talking about tape for office use or packing tape. However, I was surprised when I was cutting the tape and it split up a couple of inches when I did not get the full cut with my scissors the first time. I also used the tape to repair a cracked handle on a Rubbermaid storage container, which I normally repair with duct tape. The tape adhered well and seems to be doing just as good of a job as the duct tape normally does.When I checked the price to see how much it would cost to buy some myself, I was taken aback at the high cost. If I buy the tape myself, I would definitely not use it for packaging stuff every day. However, this tape most definitely has a place in your house for repairs or reinforcement when needed. This tape is very strong. You can even reposition the tape if needed, and still get that durable stick.Excellent for packing! So, I want to make sure that the tape stays intact. This tape has extra strength and protection against tearing across the width, which is the failure that I've seen in every piece of torn tape on delivered packages. This is a strong, strong tape. However to break the tape by attempting to pull it to its breaking point would probably take one or more tons of strength depending on how many times you rap the tape. It reminds me of the industrial tape inside your computer that keeps ribbons and wires in place. A little of this filament tape seems to hold very well in place. This tape is strong and great for shipping. The tape seems to have the same sticking power as heavier tape with thicker fibers and is just as strong while being easier to cut through when opening the package. How nice to use this tape after purchasing a truly terrible roll from a well-known office supplies chain. (Nothing worse than cheap tape that consistently splits into two separate sections as you're pulling it from the roll). This is *heavy duty* tape with very good adhesive quality. This tape is wonderfully strong and flexible, and holds even the heaviest boxes together with grace. This tape is thicker than non-filament packaging tape, which means it can be more easily grasped and pulled off a package... though it has enough adhesive to minimize risk of accidental or inadvertent mishaps along the way. This tape adheres wonderfully well to a variety of surface materials in addition to paper and cardboard, and could make a good emergency repair tape in a pinch.Because this tape has filaments inside, it is not transparent enough to be used atop mailing labels nor anything else you'd like to still be visible after this tape is applied. This filament tape is ok but it's really sticky and leaves residue on some surfaces sucn as plastic and glass tha thas to be removed with soaking and gum removers. The tape securely holds heavy loads in the cardboard boxes. I have always found strapping tape to be a PitA and a complete waste of time. I didn't use a standard tape gun dispenser. Had I used a tape gun I probably would hate this tape.The stickiness is on the good side of moderate. It is relatively strong, but whenever you add string to tape (e.g. &#34;strapping tape&#34;) the string limits the amount of adhesion. All that said, the overall is that this is a decent adhesive tape but not one that will win any awards for adhesion. You can't teat this open, you have to cut it or tear the tape off completely. Super tough tape, it almost makes it like the price is no object. But while the 8959 tape looks more impressive, it is the 893 tape which is the strongest (300 lb/in tensile strength vs. 100 lb/in). Scotch Filament 893 tape has far less of a proclivity to do this. The tape secures itself to what needs to be secured and not to what doesn't. This is the strongest filament tape I've ever used. Wow, this is the &#34;Fort Knox&#34; of packing tape. If you are applying the tape to surfaces other than paper or cardboard, it is repositionable. Filament tape is much more expensive than other plastic tapes, but it is also much stronger. I need reinforced, wide tape for frequent heavy box shipping, and have learned the hard way scrimping doesn't pay when it comes to secure packaging. I especially like 3M filament tape for this purpose. What can I say ... if you want some incredibly strong tape, look no further! This tape is REALLY strong. It's much thicker than other filament tape I've used. Used this tape on a return package the other day. I like packaging tape that covers up old bar codes, company logos, and the like - as I recycle boxes whenever I can. The tape is very durable, has great adhesion, and good flexibility. This tape works just fine. The tape is very strong. The tape is thick enough that it does not mangle and get stuck to itself before I can get it applied to the box. And it's a nice long roll so I don't have to change it out frequently on the tape gun. Strong tape. I tried this Scotch Filament Tape and found it to be a very good tape. The tape has long filaments that run the length of the tape and they really strengthen the tape. The tape itself is smooth going on and it is good and sticky.I tried it on some boxes I was preparing for storage and the tape made the boxes feel extra strong. I love strapping tape and this is the largest size I've seen. This is the tape to use when you need extra security for your shipping tasks. But you really can't go wrong with Scotch tape products, especially when compared to cheaper alternatives. Unfortunately, this filament tape is not really clear like scotch tape, but more of a cloudy opaque color. I also found this tape a little difficult to peel from the roll (once you get it going,however, it peels off the roll fine). It doesn't stick to itself like my other filament tape does, it's just right. This tape fit into my scotch tape dispenser and sealed all my shipping packages well when used with the dispenser. This is a semi-transparent tape with glass fibers embedded which give it super strength. And, that is without looping the tape&#8230; just an inch and a half stuck to either side. This tape is hilariously strong. This is very strong tape. It is filament tape, or what I've always known to be called strapping tape. This tape is meant for bundling/strapping things together, so I tried it on some four foot 1x2s. Electrical tape, at 1/15th of the price (or less) would be your better bet) for fixing cheap CD players. Who wants to pay almost $20.00 for tape? The tape sticks to most surfaces, is strong and as mentioned in the headlines, is moisture-resistant. Not wanting to cut the tape to refold the box for storage, I just left it sit taped-up.

This tape, as with regular packing tape, tears effortlessly down its length.The adhesive seems about as sticky as other packing tapes I've seen.

Be careful, if you allow this tape to stick to itself, you wont' be able to separate it.

This tape has great adhesive.
