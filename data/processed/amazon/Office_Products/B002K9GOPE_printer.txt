These worked just perfectly, they worked fine in our printer (HP Officejet AIO), they come off easily and they do not smudge if you touch the ink. These are easy to use with a printer set for an Avery 5160 Template. No printer jams and they adhere to the envelopes I've used them on without a problem so far. There was no printer jam, and the alignment was also perfect. If you only use a Inkjet printer, you may want to check out3M Permanent Adhesive Address Labels, 1 x 2.62 Inches, White, 750 per Pack (3200-A). It also seemed to work well in the printer. Used a Brother printer and the pages fit in the tray and came out evenly. They fed into my older printer with no problem and printed clearly. They didn't smudge even when fresh out of the printer. We use a Brother DFC printer and these feed through the paper tray flawlessly. I love knowing I can just pop them into the printer and don't have to worry about jams. Also easy to put in the printer and add the labels that way as well. They feed easily into the printer and stick very easily to envelopes. My printer is happy. I like them because they are thin enough to go through my finicky printer effortlessly, and work with the Avery template I already have downloaded to my desktop. The 3M Labels recommend using either the Avery 5160 or 3M 3100-A printer templates these templates are available with most standard word or print shop program. I got a new printer recently, an inkjet printer. I was really impressed by them, and they didn't gum up the printer. They use the same printer template as the other brand, #5160, and I didn't have any problem with them printing off the label.A feature that I liked is that these labels do not have a paper "margins" between the columns that usually start to come off or makes it difficult to remove individual labels. Now if I had a decent printer that would help also. Got a cheap printer but it still did a good enough job to impress me.
