This printer is a beast and reliable. This works out great for me since I have an all-in-one Epson printer that uses the 69 series and now I can just use one ink series instead of purchasing two different types.Ink cartridges:Epson 68 Series DURABrite High Capacity Color Multipack (T068520)Epson 68 Black Ink Cart Hi capacity Dual PackEpson 69 Series DURABrite Ultra Color Ink Cartridges - Multipack (T069520)Durabrite Ultra 69 Series Ink Black (T069120) First this printer is huge, (and heavy!) Very happy with this printer. This printer is fast and prints quality photos and documents.Large, heavy and a little noisy "when winding up" but no big problem. This printer is ideal for all of our large-format business and book mockup projects. We paid over 1500 for that printer and I've hated it since the day it was installed. I love printing to this printer when I want to go big on some of my photos. I like the printer overall for the quality of the print.However, there are 2 major cons.The size of the unit, and the setup.Based on the setup instructions, the unit needs to be connected in, loaded with toner, and powered up, and software installed in a specific order. I only use the printer for specific projects, so my use is more as a secondary printer and the small ink cartridges are no big problem for me.Setup was a breeze and it performs spectacularly within my installation of Windows 7 Professional. I really enjoy my wide format printer much more than I had originally anticipated...flowcharts are much nicer blown up on a 13" x 19" sheet than on the typical 8.5" x 11" - I absolutely love it! It is disappointing that a printer marketed to business lacks network connectivity.2. I received this printer on 12-4-09. Once I got this printer all set up, there were problems from the start. I checked to see if the printer was plugged in correctly, it was. I've tried tweaking the printer settings. This printer comes with series 68 inks(the high capacity inks) which I don't think was meant for great print quality. When I went to turn on the printer to install them, the printer started malfunctioning. I turned off the printer and took out the paper from the top feeding tray. I turned the printer back on and again the same thing started happening except this time it kept grabbing for paper which wasn't there and again the orange lights would continuously blink. I barely used this printer because it was only intended for use if I need to print to larger paper. My main printer is my old Canon MX850.I called Epson and got a tech support technician. Finally he told me this printer is experiencing a hardware failure and there was no fix.
