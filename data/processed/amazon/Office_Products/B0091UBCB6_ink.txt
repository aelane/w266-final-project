The ink is fairly long lasting, we have been printing for 5 months, and are only now just about to have to replace it. The ink is cheaper than the ink for my previous machine, and the print is good. * WorkForce WF-3520 All-in-One Printer* Four ink cartridges: Black, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow* Power cord* Telephone cord* Instruction manual* Set up CD. Its ink is the four single color cartridges. Aside from the ink refill issue (to be discussed later), the WF-3520 has a few irksome issues that hindered my overall perception of the unit.The WF-3520 replaces a previous Epson Stylus printer that was both outdated and out-of-ink. While only the black ink was gone (color inks full), I still had to buy all new color ink cartridges for the printer to work again (probably a computer chip in the cartridges tracks this) ... very lame. Although the ink is still expensive like allprinters, at least these last awhile.Glad I bought this printer. Maybe that the ink is expensive, but I use this thing all the time, and my ink levels are still pretty full, so in the long run they may actually be a bargain compared to others. Not perfect but not horrible either.The ink is pretty pricey and I worry how often I will have to purchase it. )I have only recently run low on ink from my initial supply, (it lasted a long time compared to my little HP printer ink), and I fear the cost of the replacement cartridges but, whatever it is, I won't mind it so much since the printer does a great job for me.I think that the printer would reduce and expand the size of photos of anything that would fit on the glass but I have yet to discover this trick yet.In summary, most folks would not need a printer with so many features but it's very nice to be able to produce color copies. The ink comes in 4 cartridges, so you just replace the colors you need to refill.I really can't say enough positive things about this printer. The ink installed without incident; the fax is connected and ready to go, and when I tested the scanner, it was working fine. Also if not bad enough the ink eventually fails after 6 months to 2 years of being in the printer. and unopened ink fails after about 2- 2.5 years. just be careful not to waste ink, only print text based documents on printer paper, and use up all ink in printer within 1 year, and out of printer within 2 years, and you should be fine. Don't be tempted to buy "compatible with" ink or refills.

While this makes the ink cartridges cheaper (since they don't need to include nozzles and the nozzle control electronics), the nozzles can get clogged over time, and you need to blast out more ink in the cleaning operation.

When it ask for you to place the ink inside, I was happy to note there would be no guessing!

However, the ink has held up for quite a while!
