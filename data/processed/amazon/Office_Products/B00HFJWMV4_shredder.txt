This shredder is perfect for destroying just about anything made from paper, as well as the occasional CD or credit card. This shredder has replaced my Fellowes that I have been using for many years. I was pretty satisfied with the shredder, but it's claims were a little exaggerated. Easy to operate, this cross-cut shredder can handle up to 24 sheets of 20 lb paper or 1 credit card, CD or DVD at a time. This shredder is a pretty decent size, but I personally don't think it's too big. So far it doesn't seem to heat up like my old shredder did where i had to wait several hours before I could start shredding again. Overall I would have to say that if you need a good shredder, then you can't go wrong with this unit. The shredder does come with everything already attached and in working order with no assembly whatsoever.The shredder itself is very sleek in design with a large interface that is very user friendly. The Amazon Basics shredder also has handles on each side that make it very easy to handle the device. This shredder really chews through stacks of paper. So this is a very large, very large shredder. We'd been using a little shredder we got nearly free at a Black Friday event some years ago. This shredder is no exception.
