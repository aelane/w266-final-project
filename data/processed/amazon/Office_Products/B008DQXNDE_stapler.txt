This cute little blue/white stapler fits right in on my desk! It is small (smaller than a regular stapler) and very easy to use. We are only now replacing a stapler of the same size by the same maker at least five decades old, and passed down by our grandparents. It's a cute little stapler, and very light. This is a pretty basic stapler - compact (5&#34; long) and of average quality. But as small as this stapler is, it takes a lot of effort to operate - too much effort really, and I have only been doing a small handful of pages at a time. But I was disappointed when it arrived, to realize that this stapler is mostly made of plastic. If I lift the stapler by its top, it opens. The stapler is your basic plastic stapler but it has a unique design. The stapler was easy to load and works great! But now, I think this is my new &#34;go to&#34; stapler. Really, what can you say about a stapler? But it's certainly built well enough to work as the occasional-use stapler that most people require. I love my new stapler. You won't be able to get away with stealing my stapler! This means that you won't be able to easily use this stapler to staple directly to your cubicle wall or to a bulletin board. A cute little stapler, that fits in your hand. I would recommend this stapler, if you are looking for one that works, and works well. This small stapler beats the old fashioned looking staplers with it's colorful pattern and small size. For a jazzy stapler to dress up your desk, this one is perfect. When I received this stapler (which didn't even come packaged in any way) my first thought were, &#34;Where are the staples?&#34;  Nope, it doesn't come with a single staple. I don't use a stapler terribly often. After my last stapler broke (don't ask), I figured I'd get another one. It's a cute little stapler, much more compact than it seems in the picture, and lightweight enough to toss in your backpack and forget about.I'm docking a point, because there were no starter staples, so I had to go to the store and get a pack before I could use the thing. It's a solid stapler by a solid brand. If you don't like a light stapler, this is not for you. This stapler is on the small end of the spectrum and takes up less real estate on my desk that most. If you want a stapler that works well but has some style, this is a great choice. I love my &#34;red stapler&#34; (you can find it on Amazon), as it is a solid steel stapler--a classic that you will have for years and years. I'm really glad I got this stapler. the stapler is not as hefty as i thought it would be, it's more of a portable half-size stapler rather than a desktop stapler. Still, it is a good stapler for what it is.This is a lightweight alternative to their high quality metal staplers. I probably wouldn't buy this same stapler again because of the reasons listed above, but I do believe in Swingline products. What a cute stapler! The stapler itself will not arrive with staples, so have those ready!Pros:- Cute! It's a stylish stapler that does what I need it to do! This is a very functional stapler that works well and is easy to operate. This stapler is a nice size for smaller hands, yet large enough for a man to handle.The action is smooth and works nicely.It doesnt have the classic Swingline &#34;feel&#34; that the full sized staplers have, and did not come with any staples, but it gets the job done. This stapler from Swingline performs as I would have expected for my personal, occasional use. First, I was very surprised that the stapler did not come with any starter staples; I had to buy staples to even see if it worked. This stapler is so cute, I almost wanted to do that. This is a great stapler, by great I mean it's a swingline which is a name brand in staplers, it appears to be built well and it staples papers without any issues.In my past I had staplers that would nearly take off your finger while shutting the lid after loading staples. This is a very nice small Swingline stapler. Yes, this is a small stapler and more of a light duty stapler vs. an office or professional one. If you want a stapler to keep on your desk for occasional use in a busy office, this is a good choice because it is distinctive looking and is unlikely to disappear. I'll admit, I haven't bought a Swingline stapler in years, but I guess I never thought that the quality and feel of the stapler would drop so drastically. I have had the stapler for about a month now. I don't use a stapler every day, so I wanted an extra one to keep around so I didn't have to go all the way upstairs to staple something. What more can a stapler do. I wanted to like this stapler. This new stapler works, but as I stated, I doubt it will last long due to the cheap plastic build, but if you're looking for an extremely lightweight and smaller-sized portable stapler (perhaps to keep in your attache or briefcase for on-the-go stapling) this might fit the bill. While the stapler is small and light, it is somewhat flimsy.Overall, it performs well. Overall, it's unique stapler, but nothing is a substitute for quality. Presumably, if you don't have a stapler, you don't have a box of staples hanging around either. This is a fantastic stapler. With this stapler, it was effortless! And it's not a huge stapler, either.The downside, for me, is the stapler's appearance. Fortunately, my mini stapler uses full-size staples, so I was able to load and test it right away. This is a great stapler for my work desk. This stapler is best for light-duty use. This is what I would call a &#34;throw away&#34; stapler. I tested the stapler on a variety of textures of paper, and was able to staple up to the 30 pages in the description, but the results were variable. The stapler is attractive and extremely light, which means it would easily fit in a school bag or briefcase for occasional use. This stapler is nice and compact. It's a regular full-size stapler, though, using standard staples. This is a lightweight stapler, made almost entirely of plastic. This is a stapler, and it works as intended. It's a decent stapler, but it just feels a bit cheap and I'm not a super fan of the very square shape. It is definitely handy to have a stapler in the house for the kids' reports and homework, especially for the pricepoint. Still, a decent little stapler. It's certainly a cool looking stapler. This is a barely functioning stapler for ultra-light use, and not a real office stapler by any means. This is such a cute stapler that I bought it for work. As an academic, I use my stapler all day, in particular to staple long articles. As usual, this stapler is another quality Swingline product. This is a cool little "stylish" stapler.T
