This us an interesting product which allows you to quickly label file folders in groups of five in one shoot. This product is useful if you are completing a large storage project but would be useless if you were simply adding a folder to your groups of files. I tried this product and liked it very much, but tried to call Avery to gather more information on their products and was disappointed with the fact that they have outsourced all of what used to be US jobs!!! They sure enough do know how to make a product right and then to market it in ways that count.---The reviewer is the author of the multi award-winning HowToDoItFrugally series of books for writers and retailers. This Avery product saves me time in that it allows me to label all my tabs at once using the enclosed label strip (which has guides on it to allow proper placement on the tabs). The product is good quality and the idea pretty handy. This was a great product to give your index dividers a professional touch. Unfortunately, the product is really designed to print a page of 100 labels at a time. The product allows me to easily and neatly label all of my tabs (and in many cases relabel them for reuse). This product did not say there would be a Mac problem until AFTER you download the template. I nearly rated this product 5-stars, and was ready to press "send" with a solid 4-star rating. Very nice product. I was impressed that this product came with the binder as well, I thought it was just the dividers, but it also came with the binder. What makes this product different is that you print a sheet of labels, remove a strip then apply the labels onto 5 tabs with one movement. I choose this Avery product because I have been pleased with their products in the past. It didn't really detract from the product and I probably could have changed it after my test copy if I had wanted.If you have any problems, there are several resources to find help including "help" tabs on each page, online chat and phone numbers. I also like that this product is made of 30% post consumer products.BEST OF ALL it is easy to apply 5 labels at once. This product by Avery is quite clever and simple for creating professionally-labeled dividers for projects needing five sections. However this product is best used with large projects--that is, at least five dividable projects at a time, in order to make use of the printable format. (Because they have so much to do) I ended up giving the product five stars because Microsoft Word is nearly ubiquitous, and this label template is included with Microsoft Word. This is an excellent product that makes an ordinarily tedious job much easier. This product is no exception.My husband has to put together frequent and spontaneous binders for his customers. I'm happy to say this product makes the task quick, easy and inexpensive. To use this product, first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website. I would not recommend this product at all. This product is worth the money for those preparing dividers for a large volume of binders. I would definitely recommend this product from Avery, and have purchased many of these for use in my job - they are great! In short, this product is fantastic for making up presentation binders for a business, but will not be useful for setting up binders for your kids for school (since they are unlikely to need 50 dividers at once). Overall, a very nice product. Great product for people looking to organize paperwork at home or in th office.
