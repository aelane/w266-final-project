If one has to fax a lot of smaller items frequently, this should be considered.I could not find a way in the menu system to make the lower paper tray as the primary tray. The Workforce 840 packs a lot of features into a small size frame in reality, although a lot of people used to smaller more compact all-in-ones may find it a little on the large size at first glance. The Epson parks them a lot more quickly.The one thing I am disappointed in is that with the fax function, you get both send and receive fax capability, BUT you can only receive faxes by printing them out. I also make a lot of copies, and having to scan in everything and then print it on my laser printer was becoming a serious hassle. This didn't leave me a lot of room for my old printer, but I managed. I used to send a lot of mail and hated switching out the paper and envelopes, a printer like this would've solved that hassle. It gives you a lot of options for using different types and sizes of papers in each tray. Very cool although it sucks up a lot of ink to do that. I usually don't install a lot of the extra software that comes with printers, as I prefer to use Photoshop for everything, from scanning, to photo manipulation. Before you even consider it, make sure you have a lot of space, both horizontally and vertically!Installation was very easy. There are a lot of little subtle nuances the Lexmark has that the Epson lacks. It saves a lot of money and aggravation since--regardless of what color you are printing--the black cartridge is a always contributor to the total color. I picked up the Lexmark Pro901 which has a lot of features but gives me a lot of headaches by just not working properly. It saves a lot of "steps." I don't print a lot of material, but it's nice that I can utilize both sides of the paper without the hassle of reloading for the second pass. I do a lot of draft prints and those turn out well too. One is clearly getting a lot for one's money.
