But you WILL use this board for listing your grocery store items, hardware pickups and other random thoughts you need to capture. A very functional white board with a convenient holder for a marker/with eraser. You can either permanently stick to the board to a surface or you can attach the magnets to the back of the tape so you can create a magnetic board (this is what I did for my steel door).I noticed a few people saying on some of this type of products that their dry erase pens were dry. It is slightly darker than non-magnetic white board surfaces, however, it is nowhere near as dark as some other magnetic dry erase surfaces. You can make the most of the dry-erase board if you use other general-purpose dry-erase markers (my all time favorites are theseQuartet EnduraGlide Fine Tip Dry-Erase Markers, Assorted Colors, 4 Pack (5001-10M)(round tip) however they don't fit in the click-in slot).The board comes with a click-in slot for attaching a marker to it. This is a small magnetic board that is good for leaving notes to your housemates or family. It isn't the sturdiest board in the world, but for under $10, I think it's a useful item to have instead of wasting paper to leave reminders or phone numbers. However, because this board is so light, it will quite happily live on your fridge door with no problems at all. The white board then sticks solidly to metal surfaces and can be removed easily.We use dry-erase board for messages and reminders. We will use the board when we take our next cruise by fastening it to the cabin steel door. The board's own magnetic coating holds the included "punctuation" magnets well, and the ultra-smooth surface does very well with a decent dry-erase marker, erasing cleanly. (Even slight texturing on a board can make a mess for cleanup. I needed a small board to put between my door and room number and this one fit the bill! I also really like that the board is magnetic, and comes with small magnets. This dry-erase board is the perfect size for her door for her to leave her messages and drawings without leaving tape marks all over the door. But white board markers are plentiful, so I bought another one from an office supply store. The board itself is fine. The board's a nice size - 14 inches long and 5.5 inches wide.A
