I could only give this product four stars out of five. I really like this product. I highly recommend this product. Interesting product but hardly new to the world. Although I do like this product, the packaging the post-its are contained in....the holder, makes it hard to put in a drawer. )Good product, a nice design and, unlike a lot of gadgets today, it works! See the product description for more information in this regard.I currently keep my dispenser next to the telephone. Really, I love this product -- it has a good weight to it, so you can grab a Post-it with just one hand.The only issue I have? This product is great at my work place where I want my sticky notes to stay on MY desk and not walk off to another desk. It's a sturdy product and I gave it 4/5 stars for the less than appealing designs they offer. This product is big and heavy and takes up valuable space on the desk, and there's nothing to rest the individual sheets on so you can write on them.
