And instead of printing photos directly from an iPad via AirPrint or directly from a Canon camera via PictBridge, you should carefully review and select your photos on the computer first, applying post-processing edits, aligning/straightening/cropping, sharpening, and other enhancements as needed. I only use this Pro-100 for printing photos that will be framed, and my favorite sizes have been 8"x10", 11"x14", and 13"x19". If you edit your photos on your computer, viewing them on an uncalibrated laptop/display screen, and then send the images to this printer, the coloration of the resulting prints may be different from the images that you were looking at on the screen. I just want to print my photos the way that my camera captured them! For photos that I have processed through HDR, which are usually a bit more saturated, I may reduce saturation by 5% or as much as 10% prior to printing them on this Pro-100. And most of my HDR-processed photos are far less saturated than many people's HDR processing since I prefer more natural and realistic-looking HDR-processed images instead of the wildly colored HDR images of some people that I think are tiresome to look at. If you normally post-process your photos to have extra color saturation, keep in mind that a dye-based printer like this Pro-100 will slightly bump up the saturation even more when compared to a pigment-based printer.&#3051; Fuzzy Wuzzy's Conclusion:Dye-based inks previously were not as colorfast as pigment-based inks over the long term. I then tried to print some photos and even though the PIXMA PRO-100 was on the network the PC was unable to communicate with the printer because I had not completed the installation process on the PC. I then tried to print some photos again and still got the unable to communicate message. I was using the PIXMA PRO-100 to print photos wirelessly over the network.Make sure the glossy side of the paper is facing you when you put the paper in the printer.At this time I have not attempted to print from non PC devices and will update when I do. It prints nicely, and had always thought it printed photos beautifully. Two of the photos were taken with aCanon EOS 5D Mark II 21.1MP Full Frame CMOS Digital SLR Camera with EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS USM Lens. But the photos look amazing, there is no doubt about that. I printed some photos using that paper and it is professional quality.No need to worry about people stealing your precious photos at printing services; if you print photos with this, you have the comfort and be able to produce professional quality easily at your home.You might feel the price might be expensive at first hand, but once you see the printing results, it's actually a major bargain. I've expected and gotten great photos from my Canon printer, however, bottom line is both color and contrast are noticeably improved with the 'Pro-100'.The 'pro-100' produces impressive and brilliant photos, and its Wifi ability is an appreciated plus.
