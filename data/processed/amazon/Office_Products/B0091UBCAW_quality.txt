With this quality you could easily scan an old image or damaged image and make it far better with less work,  just because you are starting with dust removal software and such a high dpi (dots per inch -the more you have the better the quality). It's always best to start with a great quality scan.I love that I can print from anywhere including email, iphone or ipad and that it does so many things all in one.Turns out the fax is simple-just plug in to a phone line to set up.One thing you do have to remember if you make this an additional printer and not a replacement is that you look at which printer you are printing from when you hit the print button just so it goes where you want it to. For better quality prints, I will recommend a lazer printer if budget is not a problem. Print quality seems pretty good and the color blend is close to when I use the six color photo mode on my HP. (Depending on individual, quality may be different)Copying- I was able to copy one and multiple copies. While the quality of the printing is excellent, the printer cuts off just a tiny bit of the top of documents placed within the window and it is without a doubt the S-L-O-W-E-S-T copier I have ever seen. Not quite the quality of a laser printer but the difference is hardly noticeable.One thing I really like is the connection to WiFi is easy and continuous. I even liked it enough to recommend it for my in-laws, though they went with the nearly identical WF-2530 model.Scan quality -- I have a old Canon CanoScan flatbed scanner than I can now get rid of. I was super impressed with the quality of a picture I scanned to a flash drive and then loaded onto my computer for editing. Very good quality scan; it even picked up details in black clothing.~ Scanning into Photoshop, once I could get it to work, was also good. Had they invested more on quality control and had developed a better interface, it wouldn't be such a pain to use or expensive to keep using. As I type this, many of the higher quality inks are not available from Amazon.Com.

Print quality is good, crisp and clear with good color.

I have always found Epson to be superior for photo quality printing ( I am a photographer) but because of that rather slow.
