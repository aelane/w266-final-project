So, I love owning the pen and writing with it, but I am bugged by that little defect. It's a smooth pen, but the gel does smudge on occasion. I like the pen and use it every day as it is a very comfortable and stylish writing pen. The pen is loosely held on the box's interior cushion by a loose, cheap looking piece of white elastic, which really detracted from the appearance of the pen. * An elegant looking pen, the Gel Pen has a brushed gold satin texture on both ends and a glossy band of gold with tiny black dots in the middle. Normally, I use a Sensa pen with the cushioned handgrip. The pen is gorgeous, with a gold matte finish and a dotted band around the middle. Inside, the pen is nestled on gray velveteen and held in place with a covered elastic.

Then rinse thoroughly and dry the pen before trying it again.

Handling the pen, however, both Mrs. Boilermate and I thought it felt heavy and bit slippery.

This particular pen has a pretty good heft.
