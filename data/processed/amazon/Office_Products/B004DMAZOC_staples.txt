It can&#8217;t hold many staples (it holds 1 row less than 2 inches long.) One decided to hide the extra staples for me.Already had the pages lined up and when the stapler came here it came with a sample of Swingline S.F. 4 Premium staples for optimal performance. I had to scrounge up some standard staples to test it out, since my usual go-to heavy duty stapler is a clipper stapler that uses undulated staples. The staples don't quite make it through 25 pages, in my experience, but it's not often I need to staple that much.It took me a couple minutes to figure out how to load the stapler, as it doesn't come with any instructions. It never jammed and I was able to staple 92 staples with no difficulty or soreness to my hands.As to the action of the stapler, it is incredibly easy to push down on. No crooked smashed staples that you can't get out. 4 staples and a letter thanking me for reviewing the product. I don't think any staples are usually included.There seems to be some confusion about what staples this takes. 3 staples, but the included stapes were S.F. The staples that came with it are identical to the S.F.4s I use in my Swingline 747 (the worlds best stapler). 4s, which are the standard staples for Swinglines. Loading the staples is fairly standard and is as simple as it gets. The SmartTouch is made to use standard staples which I have in abundance already.If I could change one thing, it would be the color. It's comfortable.NOT CRAZY ABOUTS:::--I'm not crazy about it not coming with staples. I don't want to be prying staples out of my stapler and then looking for superglue to get the padding to stay on it.As much as I want to love this stapler - I just can't. I never could get it to staple and WHY did it not come with staples already inserted?Update: I got the thing to work. Figuring out how to insert the staples was not easy. Just like the red staples from the movie "Office Space", this stapler has its own character. It was confusing at first to figure out how to load the staples, because the holder pulls out horizontally instead of the top swinging up like on most other staplers I have owned. 3 staples. 4 Premium staples. 4 Premium staples because when I went to the reviews on the S.F. 4 staples people wrote they were able to staple through 25 pages. 4 staples so people would be able to staple through the 25 pages it states you can?So, anyway, this is now my go-to stapler since it is so easy and doesn't hurt my hands when pressing it. It's unobtrusive, easy to use, and makes it painless to put new staples in.As other reviewers have pointed out, it's not going to work great for more than 20 sheets at a time.
