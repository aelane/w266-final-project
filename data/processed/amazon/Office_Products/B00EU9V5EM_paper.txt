You can use regular paper or photo paper and this printer allows for the smaller sized paper. I generally just use regular paper when I print a photo. Like my other Epsons, I wouldn't mind a larger paper tray, especially for when I'm printing wirelessly so the printer is a bit removed. With good paper, it produces the best photo prints of any printer I own. The paper tray does not hold reams, so needs to be refilled more frequently than with models with larger tray capacity. The paper tray holds a good stack of paper so you won't have to refill often. However, I get paper jammed frequently when I print from this tray. It could be because my photo paper was too thick (I used Cannon premium glossy photo paper). It didn't damage the paper, just didn't pick it up properly. It wasn't fast, it required pin-feed paper, it had a very low resolution 5x7 matrix print head, and cost an astounding $500 back in the 1980s. There are two paper trays, but one is solely for photos, so if you need to print letter, legal and envelopes, you have to keep opening the single tray and changing paper. It's exponentially cheaper to buy that paper! The paper tray sticks out a little beyond this, of course. I haven't printed on any photo paper yet, but printing on standard 8.5 x 11 paper showed some gorgeous colorful results.I need to test a bunch more features here in the coming weeks such as the scanner, copier, fax, and other print options like printing on a CD/DVD. I do wish the paper tray held more paper. I use photo paper, the colors are crisp and clear , it does a really good job! I used HP photo paper with good results, though.CONCLUSION:  This is our primary printer in our home right now.
