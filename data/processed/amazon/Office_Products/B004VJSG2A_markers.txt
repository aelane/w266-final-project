These are much better as markers than the small Post its!I also use these as book marks in books I'm reading, as I have 2 small children that tend to pick up my books and my book marks fall out. I use page markers or flags a lot, both at work and at home. These markers lose their stickiness after one use. Still, they don't call them 'page markers' and not 'all purpose stick to anything tags' so I don't really consider that a problem. These markers are good for the purpose they are made, I like the bright colors and they are very handy; lots of ways to use these markers when you forget everything all the time. With these markers, I can just write the word on the marker itself and stick it right where it is on the page. These markers were the perfect width for this.One thing that disappointed me is that each pad of page markers is separate, unlike the sticky flags which are attached. If you need to be able to see through your markers or need them to lie flat, stick with the traditional ones by Post-It (3M). I've compensated by moving the markers into the book a little further, but I've still lost a couple of tags when pulling books out of my backpack. The markers stay on the page and easily come off when no longer needed, leaving your book without any messy adhesive residue. I use page markers in books or magazines that I am reading and want to go back to. Otherwise, these markers work well especially with thicker, sturdier paper. I wish the markers were stored on a single cardboard dispenser to allow for easy travel. These little markers were a smash hit for that job!I used them for marking rows while knitting a baby sweater! You can even write on the markers for added notes.
