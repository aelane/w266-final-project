Photo printing on photo paper was excellent.The other criticism is not really a criticism but just a fact of life - ink is expensive, and it gets used quickly. The black and white printing quality is good, and speed is quite good.If you do not yet have an air print enabled device, this is a fantastic choice! I hadn't even realized that two sided printing was enabled! Photo printing is another noteworthy feature of this printer. Scanning and printing (copying) 10 double sided pages took about 3.5 minutes (about 20 seconds/page). You can do double sided printing with the WF-2530 but you have to do one side and then set up the next copy and then re-feed the paper copy by hand so it's very time consuming but if you don't do a lot of double sided printing then this might not be an issue for you. I love having two-sided printing in a multi-function!The printing is speedier than I was expecting for a compact multi-function. It ended with the printing of a test page, after which the printer was all set and ready for regular use.I loaded a sheet of photo paper into the paper tray, selected a high-resolution photo and told the photo application to print. Photo printing is obviously slower, but of the printers I have used it is noticeably faster than most, and the quality is among the best I have used. It easily does two-sided printing. The touchscreen LCD is nice and intuitive enough that you really don't need documentation.For printing, I noticed in other reviews that people complained that small fonts looked smeared. Tablet printing was equally easy to configure on my iPad and Nexus 7.If you're looking in the $250 range for A1O home/small office printers, the Epson XP-800 is a pretty good bargain and will be a nice addition to your home. When I did some printing I noticed that there is not a ink saver feature like on most other printers. I was throughly surprised when printing and when the print was done the print drawer automatically opened for me. It is also capable of CD/DVD printing.

With two-sided printing however, there have been a few delays for as long as three minutes over wireless from an XP OS desktop before printing commenced for documents as small as four pages.

:)The double sided printing on this is phenomenal.

Fast printing speed, amazing quality and a plethora of features that pretty much everyone would enjoy using at some point!
