The machine requires that you laminate both sides during the process. The machine took less than a minute to warm up and then each sheet was pulled through in about 20 seconds each. The machine only takes 3 or 5 mil laminate sheets. Just turn on the machine, wait about five minutes for it to warm up, when the light comes on its ready to use.The laminator comes with only two pouches, so don't plan on any big jobs for the liminator when you first get it home. Once it stops feeding itself through the machine on its own, remove the pouch and place on a dry surface to cool for about 30 seconds or so. The machine weighs only 3.2 pounds so it's easy to carry around. The machine will take it from there, pulling the pouch through and out the other side.Keep it between the lines indicated on the tray. I love this little machine!Yes, it takes 5 minutes to heat, but so do my electric hot rollers :)I had vintage pictures and some important papers I wanted to laminate.

I like this higher-end machine with it's better features and faster operation.

I love how simple it is to use with three simple buttons- one to turn on the machine (which will turn green after five minutes to show it has heated up enough), one to specify if you are using a 3 ml thick pouch or one to show you are using a 5 ml thick pouch.

The machine feeds very easily and the resulting lamination is perfect.
