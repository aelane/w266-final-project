The colors are good too for segregating files. But.... now that I am using them, I do like the bright colors in my filing cabinet. I find the colors make it easy to group my files, like yellow for taxes and red for medical records, etc. The colors are pleasant and bright, as indicated in the product image. The colors are nice, too. The assorted colors are also a nice feature as you can set the files by color to subject for easy matching. When I saw the assorted colors, they jumped out at me, but the "ready tab" really caught my eye. I like the assorted colors and love the lift up tabs that are quick and easy. Bright colors are no match for practicality. The bright colors are so much nicer than army green too. Assorted colors of folders allow for categorization of contents. I love the colors which make organizing my filing cabinet so much nicer. The colors also make is easy to recognize the folder you're looking for, especially if you have a drawer with lots of folders inside.The price for these is also right for a box of twenty, which is more than enough for my needs. All nice bright colors. It's also great to have various colors.
