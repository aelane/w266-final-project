It has five tabbed dividers. So you might want to add a few more dividers, so that you can have 5 or 6 dividers from top to bottom, visually.The note pockets have a pocket, about half of the page size, to hold papers, and also a small plastic pocket ontop of that, that can fit index cards or something of that nature. They aren't thick at all, but they aren't like the single, thin dividers that you can get at stores. Pop in some colorful dividers and it would look a lot better than the bland dark grey dividers that they have.One star off for the price because I just can't imagine most people being able to afford one binder, albeit an awesome hybrid one. Then there are 3 clear dividers that you can slip papers in through the top. I love the dividers with notecard holders, I think all of them should be that way, not just half and half.I think this notebinder is an amazing idea, that with some self improvements that you yourself can make, could become the best binder ever!! I don't know that I can use all of the dividers, probably only 3 given the volume of paper this holds. Two of the dividers are made of slightly thicker plastic and has folder pockets to hold additional paperwork. The remaining three dividers are made of thinner plastic and have an opening in each to store full papers in. The dividers handily hold quite a few sheets of extra handouts until you file them away. The first two dividers each have an 'open' half page pocket for holding papers. (The dividers and tabs are a dark smokey translucent color that would make it hard to read if you wrote on them. there are 4 plastic dividers with pockets. * The dividers are high quality and very functional with a variety of different pockets and slots to hold everything from loose papers to CDs.
