In other binders I've used for past books, this is where I stored copyrights and publishing contracts.I made it work and am proud of my organization, so it is a useful product.One other thing: the color is not a true pink; at first glance it looks red... Most other binders are made with cardboard inserts, and will fall apart when wet. It is not as stiff as most binders so I think it will be lighter which will be perfect for her. I've had lightweight binders like this in years past and found that they were desirable when weight was an issue and the contents didn't require a sturdy home and I expect that's the target for this one as well. Unlike most binders, this one is made of a solid piece of plastic, giving it more durability, but making it a bit stiffer. Unlike other binders it does not have inside pockets that are a part of the front and back. Like other binders this is a cool feature but not one that is easy to use. Most binders she uses end up with a fair amount of tape on them to hold them together before their eventual demise. I also like that these binders can hold quite a lot (300 pages). Unlike hard binders (canvas or plastic), the flexibility coupled with increased binding size make it harder to shove into a back-pack. When purchasing binders, one needs to consider the use you have intended for them. I recently received several binders to review through the amazon vine program and I must say that I like the Wilson Jones binders better than this one because their rings are tighter. It is also very durable, as I tend to drop my binders on the floor and open and close them regularly.
