so if you have things to do while your out you can  take the pages with you.. and make notes as you go along. As you would expect, these things get lost, and I spend too much time trying to round them up. I love things that make life more organized and this fits the bill. I do love that it's eco-friendly, but there are also some things that I don't love about it.Things I don't like:-I wish that there was MORE room to write things on the paper. For me, I always have more than eight things to write in that space. It IS possible to crowd two things on each line, but I would rather just have narrower lines to fit more in in the first place. I guess when things are urgent, you write smaller? I repeatedly tried various things but the moment I attempted to write on the pad, the folded cover collapsed. This is a well designed &#8220;things to do&#8221; pad. If there is more than eight things to do it is easy to flip a page and go to the next page.I find the pad visually appealing and helpful in highlighting what needs to be done. Simple little things that you should remember but you'll feel better when you can see everything and know that you've done it.I've also had times where I want to try to remember to tell somebody different things when I talk to them but when the time comes, I draw a blank. With this at least I can jot down things I need to remember. Important things or not.I've found many uses for this notepad and it doesn't take up much space and it's not an eyesore. I can always find 8 things that need to be done in a day and plenty to write down in the lined section.As far as the folding cover is concerned, it's a cheap mess that doesn't work at all, so don't buy it for that.
