This is my 4th Epson printer having used 2 from the Workforce series (excellent, speedy workhorses) and one from the Artisan series (good color printing). It seems that the printer head is dispensing a little too much ink. I have a Canon printer in the same price range that IMO does a much better job at printing photos. I really hoped I could use this printer as a all-purpose workhorse but I will have to find another that prints better documents and is cheaper on refills.The ink cartridges are individual which is nice as they can get expensive. But this printer soaks up ink. The printer opens up on its own when you send an image for printing (it doesn't close on its own). Photoreview.com gave this printer first-rate scores in build, features, print quality, print speed, and scanning. The printer also signaled to me to remove the original still on the scan bed.I then scanned to Coloring Book and it printed out a line drawing of my photo. Though it was a new printer, I tried head cleaning and nozzle checks to no avail. My Canon printer works fine with this photo paper, and personally I do not like having to be locked in to a particular brand of photo paper. I still do not think that the printer does a great job and it is relatively pricey for a desktop printer. We also own this printer and prefer it to the Epson for regular and photo printing.Canon PIXMA MX922 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner, Copier and Fax I want to like this printer, it's got all the fancy bells and whistles that get your attention... but that's what they are there for, to get our attention and take it away from all the issues. I've never had a printer with this many ink cartridges before and (wrongly) assumed that would mean clearer images and better colors.Other reviewers have gone into details regarding the substandard photo printing, and I experienced the same thing... trying different papers (even Epson branded) didn't make much difference, colors weren't as expected and the images were as crisp and clear as using my old standby Canon printer. Once the printer is on network, the Android and iOS devices will find it and print. You can also configure the printer to work with Google Cloud Print.The 950 has a Wi-Fi Direct feature. It allows you to set the printer to work as an access point without the need for a LAN. I just feel like this printer is designed primarily for photos despite the features that make it seem suitable for everyday use.Speaking of features, this is the fanciest Epson I've ever owned. This printer has all the little bells and whistles and that plus its ability to print accurate shades of red/magenta/purple are my favorite things about it.Setup: setup is easy. Connecting the printer to the network was very easy, but wasn't enough to get the scanner scanning to the computer right out of the box.Scanning: it has a very nice hinged lid which is helpful for lining things up and getting stuff in the scanner straight. So this is my first wireless printer. My previous printer was a Canon pixma that I was happy with, but it was just a printer. So having an all in one printer with good photo quality was a great find. On my Mac running MacOS X Mavericks, it was even simpler; I plugged the printer into the Mac, and the driver was automatically downloaded from apple.com (minus the adware! I disconnected the printer cable from my laptop and was now able to print from both of my computers.Once the printer was on my wireless network, it automatically showed up as a printer on my iPhone; I didn't have to do any other setup and I was able to print both pictures and emails right off my phone. Right from the printer you're asked if you want to scan to a JPG, to a PDF, or to an e-mail. This is a 5-star printer and scanner combo in my book.Note: if you're on a tight budget, take a look at the Epson XP-610. If you DO buy this printer, and run into that issue, try turning it off for a few minutes, then try it again from the start.This printer is nice and boxy, and I do like that. I am not sure, but this printer seems like it is designed to handle 11x17 more for other purposes, because the 11x17 has a feed in the back, and the trays don't handle it. I suppose before buying this printer, just think carefully about your intended use. I am very pleased with the printer so far.This unit is lower profile than my other Workforce 650 printer/scanner, but the base is larger and takes more space. The printer will accommodate printing to 8"x 14" and 11"x 17" documents but the largest document that can be copied/scanned is 8.5" x 11" (well, A4 anyway).&#9830; Limited capacity paper trays: The primary tray will accommodate up to 100 sheets and the maximum size photo paper that can be placed in the photo tray is 5"x 7. The printer can be set-up via Wireless networking, Ethernet, or USB cabling to PC. Now why would you create a printer that prints 11x17 paper and limit the scan area to such a small dimension?Yes, set up was easy and footprint is small but the three reasons above made me wonder why Epson put this machine out. If you're looking for an 11x17 printer I'd look elsewhere. I chose to setup the printer via the wireless from the control panel and it was a breeze. Sadly, with each new printer, Epson managed to screw things up little by little. The printer comes with starter ink, and its initial setup and prime will leave you with about 85% of the ink left. For a printer that is supposed to use the newest generation inks, I'm quite disappointed in the end-result. Epson's C11CD28201 Expression Photo XP-950 is not the average printer for your home office or small business. This printer is geared towards photo enthusiasts. An all-in-one printer will provide you much higher quality text and at better print speed.Overall, this Expression C11CD28201 XP-950 photo printer delivers superb photography printing. It will keep them entertained while you play with your new printer. This is a printer for people with a low-volume printing needs. Very inconvenient if the printer is in another room.
