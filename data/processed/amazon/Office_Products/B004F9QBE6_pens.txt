The pens actually look pretty cheap, like a freebie pen you would get when filling out a marketing survey. These pens have a smaller barrel then your typical pen. These pens are pretty - remind me of light sabers - BUT oh boy, I don't know what to do with them because there are very uncomfortable to use and I don't have large hands! 16 pens for under 6 bucks is good by me - I already spend enough on school supplies as it is, and my kids do tend to lose things at a frightening rate. The pens write well, too, but that's to be expected: BIC makes a perfectly good pen in general.Then the colors: these pens are definitely something my 14-year-old daughter is happy to carry and use looks-wise. These pens write beautifully on those pages also.A perfect pen for women. Worst of all, these pens seem to stop working even though there is clearly more ink left. I tried these pens because of two things, I am always losing pens and looking for a well priced pen that writes well. I also liked that these pens came in an assorted pack of pretty colors and that they were clear, so I know for sure when the ink is finally used up.As far as writing goes the pen writes smoothly and has a medium point. It used to be that all pens had blue ink, now it is difficult to find any that don't have black ink. But these are not expensive pens so why complain? These pens are marketed towards women because they are thinner than the regular BIC pen. It would be hard to discribe these pens as "elegant" because they are just colorful plastic bic pens designed "for her". I am not a "her" and these pens did not suit my functional need because they are a bit thin and not something a normal male would particulaly like. These are advertised as being "for her", since they are nice slim pens, more suitable for small hands. I hate fat, heavy pens. I have had expensive, smooth writing pens that never work as well and as long as BIC (including these Cristal series pens). I have used BIC pens in the past so thought I would give these a try.The barrel is rather slim, much slimmer than the BIC pens from the old days. She was very happy when these BIC "Cristal for Her" pens showed up. The pens look cheaper and are more lightweight compared to other chunkier pens, but will work just fine for her! It doesn't take much to please me when it comes to pens, being a HUGE fan of the BIC Cristal's for many many years. I was dubious about these pens until I held one in my hand and wrote with it. I like these pens. Women's pens? Yes, it appears even pens need to be gendered these days. But pens? The pens actually felt quite noticeably thinner to me, which felt off. We all know that Bic pens are a great product with high quality at a great price. When shopping for pens, I would look for thicker pens, but there is nothing wrong with these, they have the same Bic cartridge as the other Bic pens. I selected these pens for my wife, a teacher. While the pens perform fine, she tells me that the thinner form factor does not make any difference for her. These are basically skinnier, more colorful BIC pens. They write fine, just like any other BIC, and I like having pens like this around because they tend to walk away with my kids. )First, the pens are cute. I found that bringing pens that were distinctly feminine to work would result in my pens sticking around a lot longer--and it was easy to pick my pens up after they were pilfered. ;  So, if you're looking for a girlie-pen so you can easily identify it, these are priced well (much better than the pens with patterns like I was purchasing).Would I buy these simply because of their size? These pens are almost the same as the everyday clear (cristal) colored BIC Stick pens that live on most desks. However, the BIC Cristal For Her pens have a thinner stick part, and come in pretty pastel colors. Otherwise, they are decent everyday pens that aren't too fat, write well, and don't cost a lot. Bic Cristal For Her Ball Pens are a good-enough pens that write smoothly. These are solid pens. These pens are supposedly ergonomically designed for women's hands. These pens do come in pretty, girly colors, and they are definitely economical. I grew up with the "original" BIC "cristal" pens (they weren't called "cristal" back then - just "BIC pens") -- the ones with the six-sided clear plastic barrel -- and it's always been an inexpensive workhorse for student, home, and office use. I was very pleased at how smoothly these pens write. So, I always try to buy pens whenever they are on sale.The front of the package that these Bic Cristal For Her Ball Point Pens reminds me of women's razors. I like that these pens, the barrel is thinner, and this comes in a package of 16, which is great for a person like me who uses alot of pens. I borrowed these pens from my wife. I am going to have to give these pens back to my wife so she can write down her recipes, answer the phone and take messages, because these pens are just not masculine for my workplace.Update:Ever since I have borrowed this pen from my wife. They are fairly cheap pens, as you'd probably guess. But the pens themselves come in aqua, lavender, pink, blue, and kind of a pinkish-orange color. I'm always needing pens, so it's nice to have plenty of them for a change. These pens are thinner than normal pens and are supposedly for a woman's hand. Ordinary basic pens are boring - clear, grey, white, blah. I prefer Bic pens for my basic pen needs, other brands I have purchased have ended up not working (ink dried up) within weeks of opening or have had miniscule "catches" that drag on paper. Bic never disappoints me, and these Cristal for Her pens fit right in with my opinion of the brand - long-lasting ink, smooth ball, comfortable design.Made in South Africa, not China, in case you were wondering. Now I understand what it was - I was using pens intended for men.Now that I've seen the error of my ways I am proud to announce the title of my next book: "The Twilight Notebook of Mr. Darcy" in which a vampire named Mr. Darcy falls in love with an alzheimer's patient.The world may never be the same again. I am left handed and I hold pens in a weird way that puts a lot of pressure on the body of the pen. These pens were so thin they felt really flimsy and I worried that I might put too much pressure on it that they would break. I will stick with regular sized pens. The pens are thinner than the original Bic pen and I find it fits my hand very well, as well it just feels good. I handed out pens to a couple of co-workers and they enjoyed them too. It didn't bother me enough to not use the pens though. The pens are very slender; in fact, maybe a little too slender for the average woman's hands like mine. Plus, she will finally stop borrowing all my pens. I really like these pens! However, I would buy and use these pens!
