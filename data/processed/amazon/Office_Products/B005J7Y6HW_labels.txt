Also, the labels are split lengthwise, which means that it is extremely simple to remove the backing from the label. The labels are very clear when printed - easy to see and of high quality.Con:The device runs on four AAA batteries. I printed "Test" labels with the Epson, a LetraTag, and a Dymo RhinoPRO 1000. Although I suppose you could do this by printing multiple labels, it would be more convenient to have it all in one shot.If you tend to print the same labels over and over, you can store up to 30 in the Epson's internal memory, making it easy to design once and print over and over.My only real experience printing labels is via computer and a conventional printer, and after trying the Epson, I find it quite a bit simpler and faster. Epson generously sent it with many different colored labels to use. The labels it makes will even last through multiple runs through the dishwasher, so they're great for labeling containers. I wanted to see how the Epson labels compared.I printed up several and attached them to plastic containers and ran them through the dishwasher. than the Brother labels. The labels looked great from this printer, and as one of its major selling points, the margin on the two sides is indeed small, thus saving tape (which is expensive).The problem comes when I wanted to customize settings such as font, border, number of lines, etc. The printed labels are clear and smudge-free. The labels seem easy to remove when you want to, but also stay in place until that time comes.If you can use a computer, you can use this label maker. The labels are a breeze to cut.The  LW-300 runs off of batteries (six AAA batteries not supplied) or a power brick (also not supplied.) I've done a few labels with just one line, but most are 2-line labels, and the print is clear and easy to read. It prints mulit-line labels, which is a great plus, and can print vertical labels too! The labels stick well, and are removable without leaving any residue. I was absolutely surprised to have made labels for clothing!I was able to use this label maker without reading the directions, it's very handy - when you don't have one you don't realize what you're missing, but since I do have it I find myself reaching for it time and time again to print a quick label. I have only used labels for work related things, and usually those label makers were hyper-expensive industrial pains in the hindparts. the labels are split in the back making it easier to peal the backing off the label.3. I understand that these are just labels, but I would have expected crisper letters.Pros:Easy to useEasy to load labelsLots of choices on fonts/sizesEasy to peal back off the labelsReasonable to use for a small keyboardCons:Jagged Edges on fontsOptions menu a little confusing (had to read the instructions)LCD display a little hard to readBasically, I would have loved this device if the labels would have had crisper edges on the letters. I learned how to print labels with frames, symbols, and different font styles. They also produce iron-on labels in different colors.Overall, I found this label printer easy to learn how to use, and more useful than I expected. You can easily save frequently used labels. The labels can be adjusted in size to fit smaller cords.I've also begun scrapbooking lately and am using the label printer to make sayings for my pages.

Many of my labels consist of 1-3 words, so they might use up .75" to 1.25".
