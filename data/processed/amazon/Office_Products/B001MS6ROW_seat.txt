I'll be 74 this September but assembly was still easy for me.Has standard seat elevation adjustment. Also, the seat is covered with a tough upholstery fabric. The seat is cushy, the arm rests easily adjustable and smoothly comfortable. Assembly went without a hitch.The seat cushion is ample and rather stiff. The seat is nicely padded and supportive.3. Max seat height is generous (I even have heels on right now, and it's good, again, not at max, even.)4. (The seat does not move; just the back.)Cons:1. The seat height is adjustable, but not the pitch of the bottom of the seat.5. The seat needs better contouring to alleviate this issue.Overall, I'd rate this chair as average. The seat padding is very thick and will be comfortable for a full day's work.I think every smart company should provide these for their employees who will doubtless volunteer for unpaid overtime just so they can spend more hours per day in this fabulous chair. The seat is adjustable, as are the arms (though I was surprised that the arms don't adjust forward and back [only up and down]).Overall, you won't be disappointed. The seat cushion is very very comfortable.I have 1 problem with this chair:I'm 5-6 and I have it at the lowest setting and my (bare feet) barely reach the floor.
