This is just what I was needing and having the large tab it will make it easier to type up labels and print them to indicate which is in each folder. A one-third tab cannot be more than one-third of the folders, so this makes sense, yes?These are very nice folders, very sturdy, should last a long time. I especially like the larger tab which stands above the others in the drawer and also provides more space for me to add a description of the contents. The bigger tab allows Smead to use less stock. I especially like the large tab size, as it accomodates both more descriptive labels and larger print labels (find yourself on the top side of 40 and you'll understant that better). It is true that the tab space is much larger than the standard tabs you find on 1/3 cut folders, though I would like to know how they came up with the 90% claim. This means that the tab not only sticks up a little more than other tab folders, but also has more space for notes and information (90% larger label area), but the front part of the folder is actually also cut away a little more (1/3 cut) than other tab folders. I can write much more on the tab, however the lower lines won't be readable when in a file cabinet as the folder in front of it will cover the lower lines.

I am not sure how useful this larger tab really is because if you place letter-size papers in the folder, they will obstruct the view of the lower portion of the label anyway.

The tab space is almost double the size of normal manila folder tabs.

If the tab were wider, rather than longer, it would have been more helpful to me.
