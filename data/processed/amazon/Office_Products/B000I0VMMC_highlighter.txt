Sharpie got it right when they decided to provide a retractable highlighter pen to complement their already impressive line of markers.I was delighted to find that these pens do not bleed through the page and that the variety of colors make categorizing passages quick and easy.They come in eight bright colors and, so far, have not dried out. They are no smear, as advertised, but that's expected out of any decent highlighter. Clicking the highlighter pushes the internal cap out of the way and the chisel tip comes out. I then took a Sharpie smear-free highlighter as well as 2 others that do not claim to be smear-free and highlighted the text. They are no more smear-free than any other highlighter I have tried however. These highlighter pens work nicely, for me. I don't really care if the highlighter is yellow, blue, green, or pink, but the darker blue and purple markers don't make the underlying text pop the way I'd like them to. I don't know of any other highlighter that performs this well at that task. When I apply a conventional highlighter on top, however, the smear is quite significant, perhaps because the solvent matches the pigment. These are very good highlighter pens, and I love the convenience of the retractable covers. And even if you don't restrict yourself to using yellow as a highlighter, the darker colors in this set make the text too difficult to read when highlighted. I bought these highlighter for not taking in college class and a must say I am very pleased. I knew going into buy these that they were going to be thinner than a standard highlighter, but I still wish they had as fat of an end as a standard. The highlighter tip is retractable, so there are no caps, no pens drying out, no muss, and no fuss.

I can use a highlighter and click them open and closed and not have to worry about leaving the cap off when I'm done, or marking myself as I pick it up and set it down.Each color in this 8-pack is distinctly different.

These Sharpie highlighter pens stand up to Sharpie's high quality standards.______________________What I like:* A good assortment of colors, although I probably won't use the darkest ones as much as the lighter ones.

No more losing highlighter caps or having them on loose and drying out.
