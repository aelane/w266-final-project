Then again, I haven't had a two-sided printer before either. The printer uses one black and three color ink cartridges. I'm extremely happy with this printer already and can't wait to try everything else I possibly can on it. That was fixed by turning the printer off and then back on. It remains to be seen whether this current printer will have constant nozzle problems, or whether Epson's priming and cleaning procedures have been improved over time.ETA 2/2014: After six+ months of disuse, when I needed to print on large paper, only a few nozzles were clogged -- not surprising after that amount of disuse. This is a STUNNING printer that looks gorgeous and prints just as well! The Epson WorkForce WF-7010 printer is a beast of a printer both in size and quality. Summary: Overall I'm pleased with this printer. Really missed having that on this printer. Because it is not actually a WIFI printer but needs to be connected via either a USB or EtherNet cable, I had to rearrange the area where our so that I could connect it to our WIFI router and still use it easily. This is a printer that won't appeal to everyone. The printer will also allow an ethernet connection, though I chose to use the USB instead. I was immediately asked whether I wished to download the appropriate Epson printer software which was then installed without any need to reboot. Paper handling worked smoothly and the printer is quiet enough to be used within a home environment as well as the intended office setting. This particular printer does not have wi-fi capabilities. First of all, this printer is, in a word, large, so make sure you can accommodate its massiveness. Seriously, seemingly prints instantaneously.Although I have the printer tethered to my computer, there is ethernet capability, where the printer can get plugged into a wireless router so that you can print wirelessly. The printer wasn't known by OS X 10.7, requiring a driver to be downloaded, it wasn't quite obvious from the skimpy diagrams how to load paper into the two trays. This printer measures 22.0" Long X 16.3" Wide X 10.4" Tall. I was so impressed by this printer that I recently purchased an Epson Perfection V33 Photo Scanner (B11B200201) [Epson Perfection V33 Photo Scanner (B11B200201)]. I placed this Epson WorkForce WF-7010 printer in the office. It was well thought out.The printer has two paper trays. This printer is exactly what we were looking for in an office printer. The printer itself is huge, so plan for a large space to put it in. It really is the "do all" printer that this office needed. I would not recommend using this printer to produce photographs.== Build ==The WF-7010 is built with a simple form and aesthetic style. I was able to have the printer running on my network within a few minutes and without having to do more than, plug in two cables, insert the cd, and click next a few times. So again, this printer is not well suited for printing photos. This printer does not include a scanner, fax, memory card reader or wireless adapter. It's also just a printer, so don't expect to be able to fax or scan items.) This printer makes a lot of sense in a home office, a dorm or a college house, and for families with more than one computer.Two sided printing: This is a nice feature that saves paper. Fortunately with this printer, each main color has its own separate cartridge. [Bad]Large: This is a very large printer. Having said that, this is a LARGE FORMAT printer used to print large pages. If you have Mountain Lion, just connect your printer via USB or Ethernet and then add the printer by opening System Preferences and then Print & Scan. If the printer is properly connected (and your local network is live), your Mac will find the Epson WorkForce WF-7010 Wide-Format Color Inkjet Printer (C11CB59201) and download all the appropriate software needed. With this printer, we get professional quality and can do it ourselves. The printer works perfectly; not a single problem yet. If you need a basic printer that will print in wide format, this is the one for you. I've been using an Epson Artisan printer (810) day in and day out for about two and a half  years without a bit of trouble. I plan to use this printer only for printing photos, so the double-sided feature is not of great interest to me; however, for other purposes, such as printing brochures, this feature could be very handy indeed.3. This is an ethernet printer, but it's NOT wireless. A printer that makes larger prints is a larger printer, and this printer is no exception. Because it is a wired printer, I find my options for where to place it limited by more than simply it size.OVERALL:I like my new Workforce, and, even with the cons noted above, I can recommend it to others. But the printer is capable of doing multi-sheet posters, where it automatically tiles larger images onto multiple sheets of paper, in any of these user-selectable layouts: 2x1, 2x2, 3x3, 4x4. The printer produced 16 sheets, and when I laid them out on the floor I saw that it had indeed tiled the photo to a total size, with all 16 pages included, of 31" x 40". I had not set the printer driver to print all the way to the edges of the paper (which it will indeed do), but it is obvious that the WF-7010 can be used to produce very large multi-sheet tiled posters and such. The printer accepts either the normal capacity T126 or the high capacity T127. I think it is nice that Epson chooses to supply the printer with the high capacity cartridges, which are specified to produce approximately 945 sheets from the black cartridge and 766 sheets from the color cartridges. The OfficeMax where I bought the printer told me that the cartridges provided with the printer are "low capacity good for only a few copies", but I see no evidence of this. This massive printer performs as expected (Do not be alarmed by the size of the box, while it is indeed larger than your average printer, once out of the box you will notice it is not as large as the box and the weight suggests), it is quieter compared to other similar models, colors are accurate, printing times are fast and overall provides a good service. This printer not only help us avoid having to go to an office depot or similar stores for printouts but also provides good looking prints! Comparing this printer to other similar models or printers oriented for wide format prints, the selling price does not look bad at all, for a printer that is cheaper when compared to those, the quality of the printouts is pretty good and not of a lesser quality as we may have expected.Setting this up was quite easy by simply following the instructions once plugged, important to note, a USB or Ethernet cable for the printer is not included in the box. If you need a printer for more than a few large flyers and photos, this will work for you. I wouldn't recommend as an everyday printer. The Epson WorkForce WF-7010 printer is a fantastic printer for graphic artists and professionals who need color prints in a wide variety of sizes. On my last printer, when one color ran out, I had to replace the whole (expensive cartridge) when the other colors still had yet to run low. Epson's WorkForce 7010 wide-format printer is a hardworking standard printer. It's a good reliable printer, but if you need a little more you may want to look into one of the All-in-one Wide Format models. Kudos to Epson for updating the printer and making their products better via firmware and driver updates.Update: Feb 2013The printer is still doing well. It's nice to see a printer with an install that doesn't try to take over your computer and market you to death! Epson Work Force 7010Be warned this is a large printer, that is to be expected when you see that it can print large format paper but it was still a bit surprising to get it out of the box and see how big it really is.22 x 16.3 x 10.4 inches ; 27.1 poundsInstallation on my network through Ethernet went well. All worked fine, saw the printer and printed out beautifully.

It is a large printer at about 22" wide x 16" deep x 10" tall, but it is fairly light weight at about 25 pounds; it is light enough to be easily carried from place to place if desired, and would not overwhelm a light-duty shelf or small table.

@highlight

When I first got the printer, it allowed me to select duplex for even the larger papers, but it would print all the odd numbered pages normally, then instruct me to move the printed sheets from the exit tray to the paper tray and press a 'resume' button on the computer screen, and then it would proceed to print the second side of each sheet...this is not an uncommon way of providing a semi-automatic duplex capability.

@highlight

But the printer driver prompted me to upgrade the printer firmware, and after I did that the option for selecting duplex on larger paper sizes is now grayed out and I cannot select it; it still works fully automatically on normal paper sizes.Epson says that the speed of the WF-7010 is fastest in its class, and they list 15 PPM (pages per minute) for black and white and 8 PPM for color.
