Let me include it here:Attention AirPrint UsersThis printer can be AirPrint-enabled by installing the latest firmware update, allowing you to wirelessly print directly from an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch running iOS 4.2 or later.First, set up your printer using the installation instructions that came with it.After you finish setting up your printer, visit the manufacturer's website for instructions on updating the firmware to activate AirPrint under Support.Now, my bugaboos and basic requirements: Functionality, Dependability and Operations Cost* Capacities and Specifications:o 30-page 2-sided auto document feeder for copy, scan, fax functions (I use double sided everyday so the quick response is important to me)o Fax memory of 180 pages so no missing faxes or slow tie ups, important for a business.o Max paper size of 8.5" x 44" -NICE but I've yet to need a banner.o Prints 1-sided 16 ppm: black, 11 ppm: color. I've been a dedicated HP printer user for over 20 years and have become increasingly dissatisfied with complicated features that too easily get tangled with changes on the network and with ever increasing printing costs. This Epson printer's duty cycle is rated for up to 20,000 pages which suggests a nice lifetime. BTW, it appears that you cannot preset the printer to default print in black or greyscale. I've used this Epson printer more than the HP8500 and less than the HP 7310. I write, and had outgrown my old printer which was designed for household use. This printer is awesome. This printer works great with differing weights of paper. I cannot say enough about this printer... Not with this printer. You can connect the printer by wireless or by a UBS cable, which was what I did. Although I initially gave this printer 2 stars, I have decided to amend my review after getting some technical assistance. This printer is STILL awesome. It is the best printer I've ever owned. I highly recommend this printer. From now on, I'll NEVER be without an Epson.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We were excited to receive this fantastic printer. I like this very large printer so far. I tried to hookup a printer cord (not included) and it didn't go so well but then I tried the wireless and it worked. This printer has everything I needed and more. With my old HP printer I felt cheated with how quickly my ink ran low and how often I'd have to buy ink. This printer rocks. Better yet, the printer can identify each of our machines. The printer sat searching for the computer while my computer sat searching for the printer. since I've had this printer, and so far I haven't seen anything that indicates it is even low yet. I was certainly not expecting a printer of this size. This printer was so easy to put together, I barely glanced at the instructions, which were helpful when I did bother to look. Otherwise it seems to be a good printer. I had been wanting a new printer for my home business because I was tired of having to fill the paper tray multiple times per day. This printer's tray holds  at least 1/2 a ream of paper and is wonderful. Plus this printer does a fabulous job printing double sided. It is a fast and fairly quiet printer. It would also be a great printer for a family. Great printer! This printer provides very crisp clear images and the ink seems to be lasting quite a long time compared to our previous printer.Cons: The downside is that it physically feels fragile. I networked this printer to my home switch and within a half hour was printing without any problems. The printer comes with multiple connection options. I use a different printer for FAXing. The Epson 4530 is a big printer with lots of intelligence. If you want a simple printer, look elsewhere. While entire printer is big and somewhat bland, this is a great example of perfect functionality over stylish form. You set up an Epson printer account and it assigns you a long email  at connect.epson.com address and password. I know that every printer company does this, but for a printer called the WorkForce Pro, I feel like I should at least get the XL black ink cartridge included. Setting the printer up to a single computer was really easy though a few extra steps were required because we have two computers networked to one another. And it actually costs less to print using this printer than it does using our black-and-white laser printer. It also helped that while the printer is large it doesn't weigh as much as you might expect. I believe this all-in-one printer with fax compares favorably to any other machine of this caliber. It did seem a little noisier than another inkjet printer we have but not to the point where it was intolerable.Scanning was quick and immediately went to my computer. You'll have your printer up and running quickly. This is a fantastic printer, and perfect for the uses I'm going to put it to: personal, occasionally work documents that need to be printed in color, and scanning. When it first booted up, the printer itself had to go through a long initialization process. The printer's LCD screen interface is very easy to use, and Epson also provides a set of software that lets you set up the printer from your desktop for USB and even network connections.Pros:- Fast printing.- Auto-duplex printing support.- Scanner has a auto-feed tray for scanning multiple pages.- The black and white print quality is great. I feel like this printer has the capabilities of a large office copier/printer, but on a slightly smaller scale for home use.I have been wanting to get a laser printer for some time, knowing that they are more efficient if you print a lot of pages. They said that my printer is basically characterized as having HARDWARE FAILURE. I would be really wary of purchasing this same printer again, which is really a shame because I got such great use out of it and did love it for a year. I have only used it as a printer and the normal print looks good and is done quickly. Much more so than a Canon printer that I've been using.More to follow. It didn't fit where my old printer was - the table the old one sat on is JUST too small for this, which made for some shuffling of furniture and whatnot. Installed the printer, got it setup on my network and all that. You're supposed to shake them before putting them in the printer, but I missed that instruction. The printer didn't see my "N" connection, so it connected to my "G" one. The printer is quite fast, even when printing photos. EPSON claims the printer ink will look good printing pictures on any kind of paper. One for the printer, and one for the fax. Given this printer sells for $300, spending over 1/3 of that price on a single complete ink refill is a LOT. This printer has the capability of printing on a lot of different types of paper, but I doubt I'll be using a ton of them. The printer is marketed as having 50% lower printing costs. I've never owned a printer like this before (my home office printers have always been smaller type things likethisorthis). Every printer gets them, so I know I'll run into it some day. So the printer now has the ability to print with Epson's own "Epson Connect" as well as Google Cloud Print, and iOS' AirPrint. It's a very well connected printer. As far as the printer goes this is straight forward and easy to do. I set my MacBook Pro up to use the printer via USB and set my MacBook Air up to use the printer via WIFI --- both worked right away. At first it said it couldn't find the printer on the network, but when I tried it again, the printer immediately popped up and printed with no problem.PRINT QUALITY: The overall print quality is excellent. This is a big printer, too big to put on the desk next to your home computer. The printer works great. I will update later when they start running out.So far I am very pleased with this Epson printer. This printer has never liked working with any photo papers, but it did ok, at first. If desired, the printer can remain wired after setup. Fortunately we don't fax often.As an all-in-one printer, the Epson WorkForce Pro WP-4530 does a great job, and is a definite improvement over the Canon it replaced. This printer MAY be the one to break the cycle at our house, and I will let you know if it doesn't.We were able to fit this model on our computer desk--barely. I was elated to get to test this printer after listening to the constant complaints of my husband. While the printer is big, it still fit in the same spot that an old Canon Multifunction did -- the unit is mostly taller than your average MFP (and even bigger than my LaserJet P2015 -- my benchmark for good laser printing. in from the printer to the Mac Mini running Lion and the computer took care of the rest, integrating everything natively into the OS. Using the printer's IP address via your browser on your local network you can see some status info, but not nearly as much configurability as HP's JetDirect interface (which I'm used to in corporate environments. (I had one from my last Epson printer.) This is a great printer. The printer alerts me when a color is low, which gives me plenty of time to log onto Amazon, buy a cheap refill and get it shipped.It prints great using heavy stock and regular 20 lb paper. Overall, I am pretty pleased with my new printer and my son is happy with his new box. As I tried to add printer after that another error seemed to prevent loading. Basically, you set up the printer as you normally would and then update the firmware by going to [...] and downloading the update. The printer is fast but not much faster than the WF600. We've used this printer at home for around 4 months. We were expecting a HUGE, heavy, bulky printer, but this isn't terribly big nor is it very heavy. If you are primarily interested in a printer, or do heavy scanning, then I would suggest something else. This is the easiest printer to setup that I have ever encountered. It's not as good as my huge corporate Oki LED printer, but who would expect it to be. Given how much I like this printer, that feels like I'm quibbling...but I did find myself stopping to refill the tray for heavy print jobs and since this printer is geared for professional use (after all, it is labeled "workforce pro"!! You get what you pay for, and this Epson printer is a great value when you measure functionality against cost.Disclosure:Obtained From: Amazon VinePayment: Free I think I'll buy my next printer from a company that can make a printer that doesn't break when it jams. Once you do what you're supposed to, the printer goes to work on itself, which is supposed to take 12 minutes, but took close to 20 for me (I didn't have to do anything for it throughout - it just made a lot of noise).Once set up, everything is smooth sailing.I
