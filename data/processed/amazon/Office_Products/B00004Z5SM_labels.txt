I've been using Avery labels for my label needs for many years. However I found that I can reliably print the labels on the sheet in two several passes, even when some labels were alredy peeled off. The labels affix to envelopes easily and I haven't noticed any peeling. I have only used the labels on regular envelopes, so I don't know how they would hold up on any other type of packaging (such as padded envelopes), but will update if I ever find out. The labels could have been a little longer to allow for a longer address in larger fonts or a small picture/clip art, but I still was able to put a small jack-o-lantern in front of my friend's address when sending her a Halloween card (only really sent her one so I could use more labels just for fun). I like using Avery labels because the templates never fail. I figured these labels would be comparable with other Avery labels. I have been using Avery labels for many years and feel you can't beat their quality. Avery labels are an outstanding product and these labels have a Pop-up Edge to make peeling easy. These labels eliminate these hassles. I have used different labels over the years and it is difficult to compete with the reliability of Avery labels. These labels worked perfectly and stuck on envelopes without issues. I know it's hard to get excited about mailing labels, particularly if you do not do any broadcast mailings. But, these labels are easy to use with MS Word templates. I could have given these labels a 5 star rating but Amazon's description of 5 stars is "I Love It". I've used Avery labels for years and been very satisfied. We use address labels for mailing, for party invitations, for labeling the kids play bins and folders - all sorts of things. And these labels are no exception. I use these labels to do marketing campaigns for my small landscaping business, and I was so impressed with how crisp and clean they look.The only stickers on the sheet are the labels themselves, so they are super easy to peel off, and you aren't left with any stupid little bits sticking to your fingers once you're nearly done using the sheet of labels. These are great labels: cost effective, opaque, and they peel off their backing when you are ready to stick them on something rather than inside your printer.The free Avery templates (available online) make formatting a breeze.Highly recommended. I've been using Avery labels, including this style, for many years.Avery caught on to the potential of what was then known as the "micro computer" market at the very beginning and has turned out an amazing variety of labels for a bewildering array of purposes.Labels are actually reasonably complex products in terms of the technologies they employ, such as the adhesives they employ.Well, how do you take something as seemingly simple as a 1 x 2-5/8 inch label and make it better? I love these labels and find that they have a million uses around the house beyond just addressing envelopes and packages. The Easy Peel labels are fast off the page and onto the envelope with no picking and messing with removal.These labels can also be used as name tags for get togethers where all the guests do not know each other.And the labels can be used to mark items in storage. These particular labels feed well through the printer. First, about the labels themselves: they work very well with ink jet printers, as designed, and fed through reliably with my Canon inkjet. So, these are great labels, and I can't come up with a single complaint.Second, about the software: I have a Mac, so I didn't try the desktop software. This makes the labels extremely easy to use, as the templates avoid trial-and-error on placement and margins.All in all, a very nice label solution. There are cheaper labels than these Avery labels, but if you need extremely high quality, then these are great.And, I've had experience with cheap labels where they get stuck half-way in the printer, and then ruin the printer. The labels are easy to create using an ink-jet printer and easy to apply. I love Avery labels because:1) they provide a ton of free label templates on their website that are useful for a variety of purposes2) they peel easily and stick great to paper envelopes3) they are incredibly easy to print with high accuracy. They make affordable labels. Once this is accomplished, the labels can be put in the printer, printer settings changed to accept them, and you have printed address labels. Very easy to use these labels with Microsoft Word. what can I say other than it is labels and they work as they should. Great labels. Avery labels are my favorite brand of labels. These little labels are what we use the most in our household. These labels are the usual kind. These labels work great in an ink jet printer, but each label is very small (1 x 2+5/8 inches). These labels print well, no smudging, they feed through the printer without any problem and they seem to stick well. Good labels so far. These special labels just seem to flow right thru with a nice clean look, and no mix-ups anywhere in sight. So how can you beat that for labels? The labels are easy to peel off the sheet as well.If you go online to the Avery website, there is a free software download that allows you to customize the labels to your liking. Plus - BIG plus - is that the labels are very easy to peel off the sheet to use! Included in the labels pack is a four pack of Avery Repositionable Note Tabs. The labels are easy to print, the ink dries quickly, and come off the sheet very easily, yet stick nicely to an envelope or folder.I am very happy with these labels and would buy them again. Lately I've been noticing that some labels I buy don't seem to work with the template given to use with them. I'd pretty much almost decided no longer to print my own labels, but when given a chance to review this product, thought I'd give it another try.Well, so far so good. These are smaller labels than I usually use, as I like to put a picture on one side of the address, and these are a little too small to do that and also have room for a legible address, but that's not the fault of the labels! I love the Easy Peel labels particularly because it truly is easy to peel off. It's also handy how easy the labels are to tear off. Haven't used Avery labels for quite some time; however, since i recently became treasurer of our HOA, it's my duty to mail dues requests twice a year - labeling envelopes is never fun, but decided to try these labels... in the past, picking the label off the sheet was a wearisome, repetitive task... but now, with Avery's redesign of its label sheets, a quick two folds of the printed sheet of labels, and label edges pop up - making the job of peel-and-place a *lot* easier! I use these labels with "Poly Bubble" mailers to ship items. It's possible these labels work better with paper-based envelopes and mailers, but I no longer trust these labels and am in the process of looking for an alternative. We use these labels for all of life's major milestones.
