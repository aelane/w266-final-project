I've probably sent 10,000 staples through it and can't recall a single time it has ever jammed or failed to work properly. Opening it to load more staples is a trip - the illustration on the bottom of the stapler is useless - implying that you need to pull the main body away from the foot while pressing down on the  stapler body. Standard staples. So we went further, and got to 20 before the staples started to get squirrely.There you have it. .Just remember to load the staples points up as the stapler is upside down while you're loading it.I highly recommend this wonderful little stapler. This uses the same staples (26/6) which are standard for most staplers-----I had just bought a box prior to getting this and they do work! It uses standard staples and one small strip is provided in the box. Drive staples straight, even through thick stacks of paper2. It is the best staples I have used and it is super easy to use. Once I figured out how to insert the staples, (it did come with some installed but I wanted to check the ease of loading), I was very pleased with this item. It is spot on and does not misfire or result in any weird twisted staples or mishaps. The standard staples load easily from the opposite side you would normally load staples. It's light-weight, easy to use, and staples cleanly every time.

Loading the staples isn't real intuitive, but the simple instructions are shown on the box (there's also a label on the bottom of the stapler).

Also, I was so pleased to see that it came filled with staples!

With most staples you feel the staple going in as you press down on the stapler.
