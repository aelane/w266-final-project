This printer sits two inches higher than my HP Photosmart Premium printer which barely clears the space under my PC&#8217;s desk. And that one cannot do with the Ricoh printer as it does not have a front USB port to make that possible. I thought this printer would be excellent addition to my home office- I'm in grad school and so was drawn to the ability to scan, copy, fax and laser print all in one, and wirelessly to boot! &#34;I am truly disappointed- I would never have ordered this heavy, bulky printer if I had known it would not work with my Mac. This printer uses an all-in-one toner cartridge (instead of toner and drums).Connectivity: Both Ethernet & USB 2.0 or Wi-Fi.Maximum Print Resolution - 1200 x 600 dpiSpeed &#8211; Approx 30 copies-per-minutePaper capacity  300 sheets (250-sheet standard tray; 50-sheet bypass tray)Paper weight - 14 &#8211; 28 lb. It combines a printer, color scanner with document feeder/flatbed and fax functionality.Setup of the printer is straightforward. Taking the printer out of the box, one is confronted with many pieces of colored tape that hold the various components of the printer in place. Once that is done, the printer is ready to go.The printer features USB, Ethernet and Wireless connectivity, and a phone line connection for faxing. The printer will walk you through the process of doing this.On the software side, the included CD includes an installer for Windows (going back to Windows XP) that adds the print driver and scanner support. Once that is done, the printer is ready to go. The printer supports print sizes of envelopes up to legal sized paper in it's 50 sheet capacity paper holder The printer has a direct feed option that worked well - it claims it can handle up to 90 lb paper, but the thickest I tested it with was some white construction paper I had available. While the printer is seen by the Mac (the printer supports Apple's bonjour protocol for automatic discovery) there is no driver available. Well as a monochrome multifuntional printer, it does the job okay enough.My biggest beef is that this contraption is big and heavy!As home printer I really cannot recommend it (as a cheaper full color is prefered), this is more suited in business office. I cannot use this printer in my home office because I print color bulletins for my church; my girlfriend, Tammy, can't use it because she prints many color photographs; and neither of my two teenage nephews had any use for it. Honestly, a black-and-white printer is as archaic and obsolete as a black-and-white television. The printer doesn't take up as much space as I thought it would. The manual, however, is easy to read and follow.The printer is wireless; therefore, you must connect it to a router using an Ethernet cord, which is provided. When I set up my printer for faxing capabilities, I simply typed in my home telephone number. What I like the most, however, about this printer, is the ability to print two documents on one page through reduction. Not only does the printer have duplex capability but it also can collate. I had to set the printer using the machine to receive an IPv6 address automatically. The printer is much quieter and quicker than my old HP printer, which sounded like an airplane getting ready to take off.This 4-in-1 printer is intended for office use. A black-and-white printer is like having a black-and-white television that no one wants to watch. However, this printer can perform a multitude of functions, many of which, however, will never be used in a home setting, at least not mine. My old HP printer that was extremely inexpensive did everything except fax. It's a printer driver, why isn't there a Mac version written? I like that this printer can put out lots of black and white copies fairly quickly. This is one heavy printer (38.6 pounds) folks, so make sure you have a good sturdy place for it. If a printer can give me great B&W; prints these days, it should be used as an anchor....if it wasn't for the other qualities, I would say, "printer overboard!" This is the fastest printer I have ever used and I am VERY pleased with it.Highly recommended.
