This is a beautiful pen set! This wonderful set of TEKwriter USA gel pens is fantastic. This is a huge set of pens that has just about every fathomable color you could imagine. I gave one set to my daughter who teaches in a school for special children and the other to my neighbor who has six grand- children between the ages of 8 and 12. This dual set of gel pens is perfect. This set of pens is outstanding! This set of gel pens is best described as colorful. I have the cascading 100-pen set which collapses into a carrying case; however that case requires some room to open as it's more of an artistic display (and the lid can be a pain to put on and take off). The set contains a mix of colors and styles, including glitter ink and fluorescent ink. I received this set of pens and immediately called in some of my crafty girlfriends as well as my writer husband to come help me test. This is a great set of gel pens. This is just a pen set in different colors. I have a set that is in a desk stand, which is fine for use at home, but I often do art other places. I also think that this set would be a great gift. One entire set is 90% metallic which we're enjoying very much.
