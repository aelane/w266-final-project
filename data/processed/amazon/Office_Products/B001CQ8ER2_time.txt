I just gave it time and it eventually sorted itself out.The first problem came up while trying to scan odd-sized receipts. You end up spending more time than if you just did things manually.The only plus is that it is more compact that other scanners, and looks nice.While the concept is good, the execution is poor. I tried this but found it so complex, time consuming, and trouble prone, that I went back to my old and yes, better way. I finally got to spend some time with one and while my experience with it was mostly positive, there are some areas that could definitely use improvement.PROS:- Quick and quiet scanning- ADF supports up to a 50 page document- Scan docs, receipts, and business cards- OCR does a good job of creating searchable PDFs- Print documents and receipts directly to Neat software- Easily create reports based on receipt dataCONS:- Scans are occasionally crooked- Business cards scan poorly- Neat software is a little buggy- Free support by email onlyWith my multifunction printer, I primarily scanned documents to PDFs. I put the time into it because I hated the paper clutter in my life. Like I said, it worked well most of the time, but I'd still like to see an adjustable guide to avoid crooked scans.The only real hardware issue I had was with business card scanning. Since the last time however, I haven't experienced any further problems. In all this time, the prices have plummeted, the performance (resolution, quality, speed) soared... and the software has made little to no progress.NeatCo's system is the first attempt I've seen at addressing specific scanning needs in a systematic, well thought out manner, and the results are terrific.They started with excellent hardware. Every time I open the mail, I toss any item that I want to file into my "Neat" basket. If I had a little more time (or was a little less lazy), I could get a solution on-line, but I am waiting on the next software update to see if it solves the problem. After spending some time and playing with the NeatWorks software, I don't think I would be comfortable with anything less than 4GB memory particularly if like me there is a tendency to have any number of superfluous applications running in parallel.Objectively, I prefer to look at the Neatworks software as a work in progress because although a number of features are pretty impressive I also felt it has a few deficiencies that I hope are addressed in future updates.
