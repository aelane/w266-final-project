It's the pen cup of the gods, if you will. This cup is more versatile than an ordinary pencil cup. The two-compartment cup can be used on a desk, or the cup opens up and cana be hung on a metal surface, or there is even a hook on it that can be used to hang it from a non-metallic surface.The two compartments are a decent size, and it is a pretty purple color. This pencil cup can be used as a regular 2 compartment stand-alone cup OR you can open the cup and it will hang on a metal surface with the attached magnets. You can use it as a stand-alone cup or open it in two (becomes 2 half circles) and stick it on your fridge or some other metal surface, as the two halves of the cup are magnetic. This is a nice pencil/pen cup holder. AND, note that while this cup opens and can fit flush against the walls of one's locker, it has STRONG magnets that can actually hold this to the door on the inside of your locker. As noted on the cup, these magnets are slam proof. The cup looks as if it can take a lot of wear and tear and it is not just a plastic cup more like a fabric covered. The cup actually opens up into two semi-cylinders attached along the vertical edge. The purple cup looks great and the material it is made of is thick and sturdy. cup is split in half, and works well both on a flat surface and on my metal cabinet. The cup has a material look to it, which I prefer. This is a really cool cup for your pencils and pens, it's tall enough that I can store a pair of scissors in it, without the cup turning over.It's really well built, it looks like it'll take years of use without falling apart.Like some of the other reviewers, I'm way past using a locker in school, but if I was still doing that, this would be great, opened and attached to the metal wall with it's magnets, holding my spare pencils & pens.Pretty nifty! It can be used as a cup, or opened up into 2 half circles that each have a STONG magnetic back.I put mine on my filing cabinet and it holds a full set of precision screwdrivers. This cup can be used in one of two ways, closed and free standing as pictured or you can open it up. When I chose this I thought it was just a pencil cup. Open it up, and you have a magnetic cup holder that holds well to many metal objects - not just a locker. The cup is nice and firm making it very durable. The cup is sturdy and sufficiently large that each half of the cup can hold a lot. (The cup is ! We&#8217;re considering cutting the cup in half and leaving one half of the cup on the door of her locker and putting the other half on her desk &#8230; the cup feels like it will easily be stable enough to stand that way.Overall, this is a great little, inexpensive product. cup holder can be used as a school locker accessory.
