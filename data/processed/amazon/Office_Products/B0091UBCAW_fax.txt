Well, all except for the fax function, but I'm sure it's fine. As I use efax, I have not yet utilized the fax. We have not been using the fax feature much, but we have put this machine through it's paces with scanning, printing, and copying. However, I have not tried the fax feature as I have no need for that, but given the overall quality of the other features I am sure it likely does the job well. I did not use the fax function although it seems easy to set up provided you have a phone jack near where you plan to use the printer.This printer allows for two-sided printing and uses fairly inexpensive cartridges (1 B&W; and 3 color). I did not hook it up to the fax as there was no need but I have used the other facets of it. I did not connect the fax line, no use for it yet. It's straightfoward to copy, fax or scan. I sent a fax to myself at work and it looked good.Wi-Fi/Networking -- This is actually one of my favorite aspects of this printer. !The fax  works great I tested by sending a fax from where I work in another town , when I got home from  work that night it was there waiting for me to read!For the price I think it is a good buy and an excellent machine. The fax rates 4 1/2 Stars for smooth and fast speeds.Overall, this is a great buy for a compact All-In-One printer that will give you the convenience of mobile printing and scanning from anywhere. We were thrilled when a fax went through on our test, but when I needed to send a fax another time, it would not work at all.Copying:~ It does a decent job copying, nothing noteworthy there.Autofeeder:~ Every time I tried to use it, it would misfeed or jam.

I recently purchased a NX430 "Small In One" and was quite satisfied, even without the fax function.

The fax may be marginal in value since faxing is rare in this wireless world of Dropbox, email and the Internet "Cloud.

We geared it for fax, too.
