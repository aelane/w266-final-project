This binder is a really nice, huge size and is sturdy enough to hold all that paper. This is an awesome binder. Is a binder on your &#8220;needs&#8221; list? This is a beautiful binder and it is ready to hold 500 or so sheets of paper... but will the hinges on the covers stand the test of time? But if you use this binder often and carelessly, I wonder how the covers will hold up under those conditions. Meanwhile, I love the binder. This binder is easy to open and close and has a place in the front to put a title paper. This is a lightweight, basic binder with helpful features like front, back, and side pockets where you can insert any cover/back page. This binder is heavy duty and easy to use. this binder is very nice.one touch lever to open the rings - NO pinching fingers!you can totally customize the entire front, spine, and back with whatever you want.and, so far - NO toner transfer from paper to plastic.overall, very nice! I'm not quite sure how to review a binder. However, this Wilson Jones binder does seem to be more sturdily built than many others, with a thick cover that has openings on all three sides to allow for the insertion of custom title, back, and spine pages. It's a sturdy 3 ring binder with lots of space for your papers, reports, or whatever you are trying to use it for. I have loaded the binder with 3 editions of Woodsmith magazine, 150 pages in all, and have room left for another 200 pages. I'm using this binder to hold recipes. The binder is very sturdy, which must account for what I feel is a high price for a binder.
