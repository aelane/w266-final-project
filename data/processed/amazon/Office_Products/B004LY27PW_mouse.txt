This mouse pad is larger in surface area and 4x larger than my regular mouse pad.2) $24 for a gaming surface is steep. When I first saw this mouse pad, I mean, gaming surface, I was pretty taken back. 7 GAMING SURFACE, I thought it was a mouse pad. Firstly, as you might have guessed, this mouse pad is huge. If I were to divide this mouse pad into four quadrants, I am actually only using the lower right quadrant. However, I didn't really find it any more accurate than your average mouse pad, but maybe that's just me. I don't have to keep lifting-and-replacing the mouse to get where I need to go, and the smooth action means I can get exactly where I need to be.The cost is not cheap.

However, adding this monstrous mouse pad left everything a bit crowded. It is essentially a giant mouse pad, almost 3 times the size of a regular mouse pad. I've used many gaming mouse surfaces, my current being theFUNC INDUSTRIES Mouse Surface 1030 Mousepad Black, and their surfaces are usually radically different and smoother than the Mad Cat. This feels absolutely no different than a standard $3 Office Depot mouse pad. It seems this Cyborg Glide is perfectly sized; my mouse has yet to fall off.
