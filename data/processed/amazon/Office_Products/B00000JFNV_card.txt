Sometimes I want to create an especially personal card for someone and these half fold cards and envelopes make for a very nice end product. It can be folded into a half fold card via the scored line as designed, but doesn't have to be and the faint line isn't obvious if the page is left whole for a printed notice where you want some heft, like for a yard sale or lost pet. card stock for inkjet printers, with a crease in the middle for folding. I have been using this Avery half-fold greeting card stock for more than ten years. The greeting card has a matt-coated finish on one side for the nice reproduction of pictures and images. The card has a slight crease for easy folding. I'm usually dissapointed in card makers but these are the best I have every used. They look much better than trying to fold your own card stock. I love this card stock. This is nice thick card stock that does not bleed through. No longer do you have to contend with searching for "the perfect card" when you can create it (and personalize it) at home.I take photos and importing them on the Half Fold Blank Cards is a snap. Designing the card took a little bit of experimenting before I got the writing and picture to be organized correctly in the template. If you want to send a largish greeting card with plenty of room for photos or images, this is just what you need. In the past, I have had greeting card papers jam or refuse to feed unless the paper goes in from the top, but I had no difficulties with either printer in this case. I assumed that the same card (same pictures, words and fonts) would look about the same on them both. On this card, the colors were more vivid, and the picture was a lot sharper. This is a really nice card making kit. The card stock is very heavy and a nice texture. If you want your card on glossy paper, use glossy photo paper for your photograph, pastel or bright bonded paper for your message, and tape or paste the bonded paper to the back of the glossy paper. Or making a Father's Day card with a photo of the kids and their dad. I think I'll make a birthday card for my dad from his dog, with a picture of his dog on the cover and googly eyes pasted on.The card stock is nice and heavy, is a nice bright white that shows true colors, and is scored for easy folding. I was looking for a card size more like the ones you buy in the store but these were inexpensive and you get 20 of them. Great card stock, excellent paper and it worked great with my inkjet printer. I chose cute Christmas card design, my photo and my personal message and was done in minutes!
