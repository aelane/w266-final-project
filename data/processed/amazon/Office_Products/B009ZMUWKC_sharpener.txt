This sharpener is great because you can bring it to where you are working and use it when you need it without having to get up and stop working. This sharpener does not stop when the pencil is sharp, you just have to listen to it, and get an idea of when your pencil is sharp. If this sharpener does rip the pencil out of your hand, check your pencil because the lead/graphite might have snapped and broken but still appear to be intact even though it isn't. Compared to a non-battery powered sharpener, it's a little weak. This X-ACTO sharpener performs very well for household use. this X-Acto battery-powered sharpener is a small and reliable luxury which ensures I can quickly have a sharp pencil again.The shavings receptacle pulls off easily for emptying.This sharpener will not accommodate broader than regular pencils such asMy First Ticonderoga Primary Size #2 Beginner Pencils, Box of 12, Yellow (33312), nor can one sharpen crayons with it. I would empty this sharpener every dozen pencils or so.In terms of longevity, I can't say just yet. But I love this sharpener and am so happy I got it! This sharpener works well for homes use where you're not sharpening pencils every day. )The sharpener is 5.5 inches tall. This sharpener fills the bill very well. When I opened this sharpener, I first thought, WOW, 4 AA batteries? Our last electric sharpener only took 2 AAs.But I found that it works better than our last one.

It completely outperforms my ancient Bostitch battery-operated sharpener (which is reluctant to start and then grinds and grinds away), as well as my upright, corded Panasonic electric sharpener (which is quite slow in sharpening new pencils).The X-Acto sharpener has a large bin for catching pencil shavings, and the bin is easy to empty.

The X-Acto sharpener looks very sleek, has a small footprint, and is quiet to operate.

I would not allow this sharpener to fill to the top (or even close to the top).
