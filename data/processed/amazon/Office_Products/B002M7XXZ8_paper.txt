I've tried it on regular paper, card stock file folders, and plastic sheet protectors. Using a paper clip wasn't much better. These would work better with thicker paper such as textbooks, cookbooks, etc. I've also used paper "flags" or tabs, but not consistently.These plastic Note Tabs are extremely sturdy. I also tried one on the ordinary paper of my dictionary, and the page curled a bit after I lifted the NoteTab. Additionally, they remain firmly stuck to the paper and are durable and well-made: they haven't bent, peeled, or unstuck themselves from my notebooks.Can't believe no one had thought of these before; they really are very handy. This can save on paper and ink costs...and help the environment.If using pencil, the markings on these tabs can be erased. They are too heavy for paper. It makes a paper for future reference in a low-key way.....but you can find what you need immediately. You can write on both the green paper tab or the durable see thru plastic. Although paper has its advantages, for me the lack of easy access and re-labeling of pages was a bummer. Since they're only paper, they'd tear and rip or bend.

They stick so well I didn't think they could possibly come off without lifting paper bits and pen marks with them.But they did.

But all of them wrote on it as though it was paper.

Unlike PostIts which are made out of paper, are not see-through and have only a small sticky part on top of their backside, the Avery NoteTab is a combination of thick paper (tab) and transparent plastic, where the backside of the transparent part is entirely sticky.At first glance and try, these work very well.
