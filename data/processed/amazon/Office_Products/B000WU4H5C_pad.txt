But it's easy enough to lift the pad and move it around - you just can't slide it. Adjust the 2.75" wide pad towards or away from the keyboard to accomodate different sized wrists and hands.The surface is a leather-textured vinyl material that's easier to clean than fabric and is Anti-bacterial for those who lack basic hand-washing skills. This pad is very helpful to cushion the wrists and make up the difference in height between the keyboard and desk surface. The 3m pad is clearly a nice. more professional looking pad, but for those of us with arthritis (I am assuming other arthritis sufferers will feel this way, though I could be wrong) comfort, reduced fatigue and joint pain are more of an issue, at least for myself I can say this is the case. I am more than willing to live with a funny looking purple pad on my desk if it helps me feel better. This has been a reliably comfortable and non-slip pad. This is one long pad. This pad bridges the gap, but does so much more. I have used it with my Steel Series mouse pad without problems. This little pad has a bit of grip on the underside, and holds nicely on the arm. This pad boasts Antimocrobial protection. It would be wise to carry your own Gel pad and use only your own as opposed to using computer accesories that many hands have touched. This pad feels great! Overall I really love this pad and recommend it.
