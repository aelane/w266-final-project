Great chair, easy to assemble. This is the second Hon chair I've received as part of the Amazon Vine program. You cannot lock the chair into the tilt back position.The Con's:- The directions for the assembly of this item are minimal, but worse, the directions for its use are non-existent! For as much as you pay for this chair, you'd like to know how the features work without a hassle!UPDATE: 5/17/13I've been using this chair for quite awhile now, and find it's good for me most of the time. I give this 1-star because the chair is too small to fit the majority of adults (and not documented as such). When I first got the chair, the slightest disturbance could cause it to drop to the bottom, for example, leaning forward or bumping it while walking by. Experimenting with the chair upside-down, I can see a slight movement. I was unable to adjust the chair while sitting in it. Most of the chair models I see have padded _convex_ armrests which provide comfort at many angles. The one positive was that the chair assembled quickly and easily. Although the chair leans back, it does so only with determined effort and does not reach an incline that might be considered deep enough for dozing off. So, you might be thinking this is an unforgiving, uncomfortable, undesirable chair from office hell, but you would be wrong.They call it a "task chair", I presume, because it is meant to help you work. This chair is actually plenty comfortable, and it allows me to sit comfortably for hours. Yes, it isn't the most comfortable chair in the world, and I would have preferred a mesh back like theLorell Executive High-Back Chair,Mesh Fabric,28-1/2"x28-1/2"x45,BK, but the support is good, the fabric comfortable, the overall design clean and sleek. It is hard to not appreciate this chair. This Hon Ignition Task chair is only one choice in the line of Hon chairs. This chair arrives in a large box which may be difficult for some people to get into their home or apartment. Once opened, the chair is in three pieces which are incredibly easy to put together. The chair arms have snap levers on them so that you can open the lever, place the arms all the way in toward the chair or all the way to the outside of the chair and then snap the lever back closed. This worked best when I was sitting in the chair and had my husband slowly click the back up one position at a time until the lumbar support was in the perfect place for me. The chair seat and back will tilt back quite far, but you must make that action happen by pushing with your feet on the floor and there is no way to lock that tilt position down. Yes, the chair will tilt. The chair swivels a full 360 degrees and is guaranteed for use by a person up to 300 pounds.I have found that paying a visit to the hon-dot-com website will help you figure out any questions you have regarding what features this chair does or does not have. I find the chair to be quite comfortable and expect to have many hours of quality usage from this chair. I had this chair "built" in about 2 minutes and I was ready to try it out.Unlike many other more modern chairs (and many others by Hon), the back of this chair is a fabric covered foam, not a mesh. The chair didn't allow either - while the height of the back is adjustable, the angle and tilt of it is not. As for me, I am happily returning to myHON Boda HMH01 Mesh Work Chairand putting this chair in the corner for guests. The chair comes in a huge box and is well packed. Although this chair was extremely easy to assemble with no instructions but simple pictures, I was terribly disappointed in that the back of the chair can not be adjusted to lean back. It costs more, but I can see why.Sorry I couldn't rave about this chair, but if you are short, and like to sit straight up then this chair should be just right. Also it's a sturdy chair, perhaps a bit heavy, but that should mean that it's substantial and will hold up. The chair is very comforatble and heavy duty. As I already stated, the chair is on the narrow side so people on the more fuller side may not like it. This Hon chair came to me in a huge box nearly completely assembled. To unlock and allow the chair to recline, pull the lever outwards.This is a cloth-covered chair. This chair is perfect for a small office space in that it maneuvers quite well and glides effortlessly. This chair is so basic, it looks like it belongs in a very plain workplace. The chair does feel solid, about as solid as a chair in its price range, and I've tried a few in my life, lol. After using the chair a few days, the seat deck started compressing as you would expect and started taking shape with a bit of a hump in the center which really wasn't comfortable (which was a shame because this chair doesn't cut circulation from my legs as much as others). It'll work once you get it where you need it, but if you need to move the chair to vacuum, etc, you'd better remember to grab the arm and roll the chair. I tend to grab a chair's seat back and lift 'n move, and doing that with this chair makes the back pull right up to the highest setting. The chair had an atractive contemporary look to itNow the bad news, this chair is not comfortable. The chair seat is an inch or two shorter than comparable models and does not feel supportive when you sit in it. You can adjust the chair arm supports and you can raise and lower the height of the chair. This chair would be OK for short stints but if you are going to sit in it for an extended period I'd look for something more comfortable.Lastly, the chair came with no directions on how to adjust the various settings, this may seem a minor complaint but with a purchase this costly the buyer should receive some directions. I can say that I like this chair quite a bit, and it now has become my primary computer chair. Many former chair of mine have a lot of problems with the arms where the padding starts to crumble and/or the arms break off. It's annoying to have to always lower my chair multiple times per day so I lowered my review from 4 stars to 3 stars. This chair isn't very comfortable and it isn't designed very well. The upper chair assembly was in one piece. This appears to lock the chair mechanism in place and was already locked so it doesn't seem to matter that much but it is concern that it got damaged.As far as the chair itself, this is a very comfortable chair, it was the first thing I noticed because often when you sit in a chair you want to adjust it or adjust your posture but with this one it was an instant comfortable feel. Also you can sit in this chair for long period of time without feeling it necessary to stand up so as it name suggests, this chair would be great for achieving long tasks. I have to say that this is a great little chair for the price. I have a very expensive chair at work that allows for all sorts of adjustments, and this little chair is just about as good. It is also a very nice looking chair.
