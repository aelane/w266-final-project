That said, I realize they are a generic product, so you may want to shop based mostly on price. Good product for mailings and labeling  folders and such in the office. Personally, I think it's worth it to spend a little extra & get a good product like this one. This product does exactly what it purports to. Another great product from the people who brought you the sticky note! Good product quality, too small for my use and too many for my use. !Great product, easy to use, easy recommendation!! I would seek a product, in their stead, that could be used easily for more than one purpose and were not tied to one proprietary template. With this product, you get 25 sheets per pack, 80 return labels per sheet. What can you say about a product such as this? This product is exactly as described. As such, it's good to see a product that can reliably stick to more than 20 lbs paper. Good product. They peel easily and I'm glad that this product is made in the USA. This superior product is about three dollars cheaper than Avery, so no need to pay for a label. I'm glad to recommend this particular product. Amazon's product description is a little misleading: "3M Permanent Adhesive Shipping Labels"These are NOT shipping labels but Return Address Labels. 3M has created yet another reliable worthwhile product in their stable of great office products. Currently, the 3M product is less costly, which represents a savings for the buyer with no downside.Highly recommended! I am giving this product five stars because it still works and looks good even though the labels were soaked in snow and kind of warped.The adhesive is still good, does not fall off, sticks solidly and well. Therefore this product, in my opinion, didn't break any new ground in the world of address labels. Notwithstanding, I would be compelled to purchase this product again because of its good quality. Great product! I've used this product many times in the past, which is why I asked for them through Vines.

The very best product feature, as far as I'm concerned, is the "Quick Lift" peeling.

A good product.

They need to adher to the product, and be somewhat removable if I need to lift it immediately.For computer usage, labels need to flow into the printer, not jam up, and not be affected by the heat of printers.
