There are two clear pockets on each side. There are two slip-style plastic pockets on either inside cover of the binder; these are nice to have, although they are not going to be able to hold more than a sheet or two.These is a great binder, and if you that's what you need, I would definitely recommend it. Higher pockets means the stuff in them doesn't fall out constantly. It has four pockets instead of two so you can keep papers divided if need be. The pockets are transparent, full sized, and located two on each binder side. The 2-level pockets on the inside are also very nice - everybody always wants a couple of those; not sure why they aren't just standard in every binder. I like the interior pockets but wish it had a clear sleeve on the front because that's a good place to slide in a piece of paper to serve as a cover or decoration. It has no pockets on the outside to make a label or cover with. It does have double pockets on the inside. There are two clear pockets inside the front and back cover. I loved the 2 clear pockets inside of it, and it held my information securely and was never any trouble to open or close. The pockets in the front are holding up nicely to constant use as well. First of all, this does not have 4 pockets. It has double pockets to hold papers, but not too many papers.
