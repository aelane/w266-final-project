But if you want to take some papers that have piled up and shred them, that's a great use for this product. I love how I can just stack the papers in the tray and the shredder feeds the papers by itself into the shredder. As long as the papers are not wrinkled the tray with the stack will take about 60 pages. Now I can stack my papers directly in this unit and shred whenever I push the button.The speed is good!The sound is pretty quiet!Good container...can hold a descent amount of shredded paper.If everything is straight paper it works great.But. ), I discovered that it won't automatically shred glossy papers, booklets that are stapled on the side, or smaller papers, but smaller items can be shredded manually. Sometimes it would work the papers out itself after they were stuck, but most of the time I would have to manually remove the jam.If you're looking at this for the hands-free feature, it's a pain, so I would be prepared to babysit it or look elsewhere. You'd want to sandwich those between other more straight papers that you were shredding.On to the "selling point" - the stackable area. It will turn off when you open it and you can plop down more papers, close it and it will start up again. Put the papers in the tray and walk away: something you can't do with the Fellow shredders I've seen.I'm very pleased with it. Similarly, when you're loading papers in the Swingline, keep in mind the position of the feed rollers. It shreds through 80 papers in the bin in minutes, and if they are all in decent shape (without creases or folds) it can do it in just a few minutes.The only bummer is that the holding area at the bottom with all my shredded paper seems to jam up the shredder before it fills. So you're stuck with putting your papers in through the top, one at a time, and fighting the endless paper jams.I have an Amazon Basics Strip-Cut Shredder that was selling for about 30 dollars at the time I got it. But it will actually not shred more than 15 papers in a single turn. 10 - 12 papers will be the correct amount that it will shred.
