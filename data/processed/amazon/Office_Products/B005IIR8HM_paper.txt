And, its paper tray holds over 300 sheets before needing to add more paper. The paper tray is enormous - you have to be printing a manifesto to run out of paper without paying attention. They weren't that much better but told me to email them my paper work. Some CONS would be: I wish the paper tray held more paper and I wish it were quieter during the printing process. The paper tray holds 330 sheets of paper!SetupThe complete setup took me about 45 minutes. The paper feed is smooth, the print function is speedy. There is a paper tray and a secondary manual paper feed for thicker papers and specialty papers. However, whenever I tried to print with photo paper loaded into the front tray, the printer kept telling me it was out of paper, or a paper jam.Here's the problem: this printer has a rear (vertical) feed and a front paper tray. If you try to print photo paper in the front tray tray, the printer will hang up. The paper drawer does take some getting used to, but the entire thing pops out and essentially acts as a "paper cartridge" for your printing needs. I had a couple paper misfeeds, but they usually only occurred every 100 pages at most and were quick to unjam (just had to take out the "paper cartridge"). Loaded paper and then ran the installer.Installing softwareIt's pretty straight forward. The paper cassette holds about 300 sheets or more. It does seem better on standard paper than special paper, so I'll buy that. Most noticeable is frequent paper jams, and extra pages being fed. So far, no paper jams.If you need to update your Gutenburg-era printer, this is well worth considering. After 2 small paper errors, we figured out it was user error and corrected our problem. The main paper tray holds 250 letter-sized pages, sufficient for most home/small business uses.The user interface of the on-screen display is okay; it's controlled with arrow keys nearby. The paper cassette has a 250 sheet capacity and is light-weight.

Your primary paper (for me, 8.5x11) is loaded in a tray that disappears completely inside the printer.

If you don't do that, the paper will NOT stay in the printer and falls on the floor.

There was a small paper inside the box here saying this printer worked with iOS AirPrint, but only after a firmware update (which is the aforementioned one I talked about earlier).
