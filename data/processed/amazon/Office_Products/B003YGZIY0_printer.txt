This is a great little printer. Nice basic printer for less then the price of ink cartridges, what else can you ask for? I was looknig for a basic printer without any bells and whistles, this one fit the bill. All printer I have ever had I could use as a printer for your computer or by itself as a copier. This printer you can ONLY use with your computer. I learned about it when I set the printer up and found out there is no place to place my the document  I wanted to print. This is a wonderful printer and I have had no problems with it. My $140 Epson printer died just after the warranty expired, so I was looking for something cheap this time. I mean, if the a printer is gonna die after a year of gentle use, I might as well spend as little as possible on it.This HP printer fits the bill. I was looking for a simple printer and this one does the job. I recently ordered this printer for my laptop. It seems like I've owned every printer out there - from the top of the line laser scanner/printer/copier to the sturdy old dot-matrix. I bought this printer in February 2011 and just now (September 2011) ran out of ink. This is actually the first printer I've owned in the last couple of years that I've found it more economical to buy a new cartridge than it would be to buy a whole new printer (which usually includes TWO cartridges).It's not wireless, but I'm able to share it on our home network through Windows 7 Home Premium, so no problem there. I just wanted a printer that printed when I press the "print" button, didn't cost a bundle to purchase OR maintain and lasted for more than a few months.The HP DeskJet 1000 is exactly that, so I'm happy. The printer is so quiet, that when I first used it, I had to check to see if it worked. This printer is a little workhorse! And as always, HP printer cartridges last a while. I've had this printer for over a year and it works fine,but the toners are just way too expensive. I paid $29.99for this printer when it originally went on sale and, asI stated, it's a pretty OK light weight printer foreveryday stuff. The printer that I have in my den ran out of ink, and I ran to Walmart to buy refills. The printer is very basic, there are no bells or whistles. The printer in this room was only to be used for printing general documents, or fun artwork that my granddaughter creates on the computer. The printer does a nice job with speed and results.

This little printer is a cinch to set up and the quality of the graphics it produces is excellent.

The printer also comes with a double supply of ink for both color and black: 61/61 XL.

Hopefully you'll have one from a previous printer.
