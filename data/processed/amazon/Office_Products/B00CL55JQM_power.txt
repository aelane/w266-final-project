I never have to worry about running out of power. The power is on the weak side, I guess, but I found it more than adequate, albeit it took a little longer than it would with a standard electric model. I tried using this with the USB power and with four aa batteries. I found it worked the same with either power source. The power is there when using batteries or AC (via a USB wall adapter, not included), but even then, it doesn't get a pencil to that super sharp stage you want in a sharpened pencil.This might be a good idea for students who just need an occasional pencil sharpened, and &#34;kinda&#34; sharp is good enough, but if you use a pencil for any precision writing, I don't think you're going to like the way this sharpens. The power port where the (rather cheap) USB cord is supposed to attach was misaligned, which meant the power cord couldn't plug in. They offered USB power, and I wanted to get USB power.I am a gadget person, though, so I tore it apart, fixed the alignment problem, and got it working. I like that you can power this via your pc or any usb power source. It's not bad, it works for me and has enough power. I was so happy when it arrived, it has a usb power cord for plugging into the computer. There was barely enough power to even turn the pencil. This provided enough power to actually sharpen the pencil, but it was NOT a smooth point.
