If you enjoy using this set, you are going to use some of them up very quickly. I love these and after these run out, I will purchase another set. This set of 100 gel pens has lots of fun colors. A nice set of pens at a good price. )Overall, this is a nice set and I'd recommend this understanding the limitations. The only negative is that when you get the set, you have to put all the pens into the carousel yourself. I've always wanted a big set of gel pens like this it was so much fun putting them in order on the rotating base. This is a huge set of gel pens which I love! This is a nice set of pens. This a very nice set of 100 gel pens in a cute lazy Susan which is very useful for casual use - the pens are not coded unlike Stabilio's 88 seriesStabilo 88 Roll Up Set - 25 Color- so it's unclear as to whether many of the color hues are really different from each other and how you'd rematch a pen  to a drawing in progress. Buy a set with glitter and metallics only.These pens also use a unique technology that helps prevent them from drying out.

I've only been playing with this set for a few hours, but here are my initial observations:Pros:*  Having 100 colors is great--this is a great color range.
