I like these pens. I hold pens not with the tips of my fingers like most, but a little lower just above the knuckle area. What I loved about these pens is they write without the need to apply any pressure at all, even for those of us with a slightly different grip. The pens are retractable for storage and there is a solid plastic clip on each pen for clipping to shirt pockets.The colors of the each pens are an array of greys, silvers and chrome colors. Definitely designed to be much nicer than the typical cheap throw away disposable pens, but just below the level of buying just a single expensive silver or gold pen. These pens have a good grip, but I found the pen was a little uncomfortable for me to hold due to its thickness and would probably be more for a man with larger fingers. These pens are lovely. All in all these are amazing pens. The pens feel light and perfect in my hand. The pens are also refillable. While these pens are a little pricey, I think it is definitely worth it for the higher quality. These are the best pens!I gave up using Bics because they wouldn't write after being carried around in my pocket and had a tendency to leak. These pens can be carried in my pants pocket all day and write every time. I've switched and I'm never going back.These pens are also great for making NCR copies. I really like these pens. Disposable pens tend to be a dime a dozen...or even cheaper. These pens fit the category.The barrel of the pen is substantial making it easy to rest in your fingers without much pressure. I love gel pens. And, in general, I love Bic pens. These pens don't write smoothly at all--in fact, writing is almost impossible. These pens are very smooth and flow great! However, the pens I had been using still worked fine._________________________________________________________________This is a more pricey pen than I normally use. I have had better pens for less $'s , though.I have no clue what the benefit of gel vs ink is, I may be missing something there!1 Note that I don't believe anyone else has mentioned: 10 of my 12 pens had a small piece of glue on the point that must be removed before the pen will work. These are great pens. I like gel pens and typically I look for 1.0mm tips for the feel and broad stroke but these 0.7mm pens might just make me a convert.The ink is jet black and provides a mostly solid line. These pens have a nice fine gel point, as advertised. These are excellent pens for any type of writing.As a gel pen, they are the preferred for check writing for security reasons.As for general purpose writing, they work the first time, no drawing little circles till the ink starts.As for long term, I wrote out several pages of RPG material and there were no smears or blobs, no ink running out in the middle of words and the pen felt quite good in my hand.I also carry one around in my pocket all day and it has not leaked, still writes on the first try and it withstood my working out in the landscape quite well.Overall a magnificent pen for any use. These pens are nice and a very good quality. I tried the Uniball Roller pens but their ink was so dark that it made writing on the back of pages impossible. Gel pens, because of their nature, run out of ink faster than other types of pens. However, I passed the pens around the office and, of the three people I asked, everyone really enjoyed them. I like pens in all their variations. But these pens, do not look cheap and their logo is not as visible. Since pens are refillable,I intend to give half of them to my friend who si a school teacher and the other half to my co-workers at work who I know take a lot of notes during various meetings. I use gel pens pretty much exclusively at this point. I have been using these pens for over a month, and have no complaints whatsoever. These pens tend to deposit relatively consistent ink, with just minimal variances in width. I store the pens stored horizontally once the ball is removed. These pens are comfortable to hold and right with. However, it doesn't "flow" or write as smooth as other pens I've used. I really like these pens. Further, these pens seem to outlast others I have tried.I am very happy with these pens and would recommend them to anyone in search of a quality writing device. I am happy about that since I always use Bic pens, I use them, I used to sell them and they are, in my opinion, the best low cost writing implements made today. I am happy, these pens are about $2.00 each a very good deal when you compare to the higher priced brands.All and all a solid neat comfortable pen I recommend it.I
