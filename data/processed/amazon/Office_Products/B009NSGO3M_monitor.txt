)You can mount only one monitor if you like, although if you aren't anticipating adding a second one then you should buy a different model.You can mount the base using a simple clamp or by going through a grommetted hole that's been cut through the top surface of your desk. This is a nice monitor stand, but before getting into the details, I'd like to give credit to 3M. I was shopping around for a dual monitor stand earlier this year (including this one) because I wanted to free up some desk space. Instead of having to track them down somewhere, they are right there when you need them...and they are hidden away behind the monitor. With a 24" monitor and a 22" monitor, I can't quite get them to be one on top of the other and still be centered without the top one being angled down quite a bit because of the height of the pole. Before I begin, I'll let you know I only have a single monitor and I'm using this arm mounted to an end table next to my couch in the living room. Having said that, this is a decent monitor arm and I've had no issues with stability or shaking. The first monitor will be used for news and email. If you are dual monitor user then this is the way to go. Getting this monitor arm system set up was not too hard. I really like being able to rotate my monitor into the "portrait" mode. For a heavier monitor, I found that it is difficult to tighten it enough for the monitor to stay in position and not tilt itself forward on its own. This dual monitor arm is well-built and my monitors feel very sturdy on them. For those who need dual monitor capability, this is a great option to maximize space and flexibility. The monitor can either be directly screwed to the arm, or can be attached via an included quick-release plate.Some older/heavier professional monitors might exceed the 20lbs-per-arm limit, but lightweight modern screens fit inside the limit easily. But even with just one monitor, the base leans towards the monitor (slightly, though still stable)-- for two monitors, you're going to want to use the grommet mount.If it's not clear from the pictures, this is not a tilt/swivel arm. I can move the monitor towards and away from me (with some effort), but up-and down require changing where the arm attaches to the post (which takes some effort with a monitor loaded on the arm). This dual monitor support is well constructed and solid. These dual monitor arms are incredible. This is one of the few monitor arms that works fine on a cubicle desk - it allows you to place it on your desk if you have a wall behind the desk preventing open access on the rear. The monitor angle is controlled by a ball joint, whose tension is controlled by tightening an friction bolt. I was a little skeptical about paying this much for a dual monitor arm, but given earlier bad experiences with the el cheapo brands, I decided to fork over the money and hope I would receive a decent return on my investment.

Be sure to test this without a monitor on it first.- The price.I'm not sure if this is a "con" or not, but I installed this on the backside of my desk and wanted to have my monitors near the back of my desk.

I got this dual monitor arm system to use with the twoDell 27" widescreen monitorsthat I use for my work as a software developer.

Repositioning each monitor higher, lower, left, or right has a little resistance to it, but is also fairly easy to do.+ Having these arms in place opens up a fair amount of open space on my desk top.
