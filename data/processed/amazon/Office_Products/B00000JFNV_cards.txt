I purchase these cards frequently to make my own birthday, Christmas and other holiday greetings. The cards themselves are of high quality and help me create a final product I can be proud of. The resulting cards show lines of print instead of a smooth picture--not exactly professional quality. If you cut the cards in half for note cards and miss the scored line by a tiny amount, it doesn't show so your note cards still look perfect.I will definitely buy more of these cards. These cards reproduce photographs very nicely, in bright, vibrant color.The half-fold is nice as it gives you plenty of room for artwork and personalized messages on the inside. These are nice sturdy cards and envelopes that print up very nice and crisp. They are not photo cards but a slightly shiny card stock, they fold so easily on the fold mark, fit the envelopes nicely and no extra postage required. These are not fancy cards but are nice enough to send out to others. I use Printshop for making cards, so I have never tried the free templates and software. my cards turn out very well I will buy this paper again. I found the cards to be simple to load, and the card stock itself is firm and easy to handle. I like these larger cards for relatives whose vision isn't great. Totally satisfied and will use this for future cards. These cards are made of pretty good card stock with nice envelopes. The cards have a nice feel to them and the scoring in the middle of the sheets make them very easy to fold cleanly and evenly. I don't  go out and spend $5-6.00 PER CARD for those  generic cards you get at drug stores anymore....... that's ridiculous. I love designing and personalizing the cards I send out at a fraction of the cost. I had some less-expensive half-fold cards that I had purchased previously. I also used these cards and Avery's DesignPro software to print Christmas cards and they looked like something I could have bought at the store. You can easly download Avery Templates and Software to help you make beautiful cards everyone will enjoy receiving. You can also design and print your cards via their web site; it generates a PDF file that you print one side at a time. It works well for run-of-the-mill cards like larger quantities of Christmas cards, but I prefer to use a better quality for special cards. The cards and envelopes are a good quality paper and have a nice feel to them. The cards printed out beautifully and saved us a trip to the card shop (and some big $$$ spent there usually). I used 10 of these Avery cards to make a stationery set for friends. Making greeting cards on the computer is lots of fun, and Avery makes it simple with these half-fold greeting cards! Now with 25 cards."). These cards allow us to make beautiful, personalized custom cards at a fraction of what we'd pay for those overpriced, impersonal store-bought ones. These greeting cards worked really good. I didn't like starting with just blank cards.
