I used this for my Christmas gift wrapping - all done in my bedroom closet to avoid detection by my kids. This pretty much was designed with gift wrapping in mind. Grab one for a gift too - they're really that good. This is wonderful for gift wrapping. If you use three or four per gift and you got a big family, the tape only lasts an hour or so.Good invention but it needs to be tweaked to dispense more tape and at greater lengths than just two inches. I mostly use gift bags, which are easier and faster in the long run.The band fit nicely on my wrist. This did make my gift wrapping more fun, and less of a chore. I use gift bags now for almost everything so I have little need for a product like this. This is perfect to keep with your gift wrapping materials.

They are fine for gift wrapping and most other uses, but they could be inadequate for other taping tasks.

It is quite light weight - you really don't even notice it, and it does not interfere at all with gift wrapping process.

I consider myself a pro at gift wrapping after 50 years of practice since my childhood, but I still always wish for new products to make this skill easier and quicker.A couple years ago, I bought the Scotch Gift Wrap Cutter.
