This means you'll print into the upper left card the first time, then have to edit your document to use the next square (so you can reuse the same sheet).- Not the best solution for large quantities--but this is pretty obvious. If you want to have a card for all occassions,  it's easy - just get these Business cards and you can make up as many as you need,  with whatever design you want...These cards allow me a flexibility that vista cards do not, so I can change them subtly if I need to. The card stock is lightweight and will not jam or print lopsided because the card stock is too thick for underpowered home printers. I have a card made up for each kind of wood that I use and give it with the pen when I sell them. Add to that my own card and that makes a lot of cards to be printing and cutting!I've been doing the cards the hard way and printing them on card stock and then cutting them out. On the card, it had her daughter's name, their phone number, and a message that went a little like this: "Bonnie would love to play with you in the near future". card for wallet, business card, mini-invite, RSVP card, you name it...So why THIS card? If you really needed 80+ card that were all the same, you might want to try some of the online vendors. Never does a card edge rip and the process is very fast.Compared to any other brands that I've tried, these Avery Clean Edge Business Cards are my clear favorite. The card printing quality alone would make this a fantastic product... adding the online templates makes it a SIX star product. This is so much cheaper than "professional" card making that it really helps the self employed person on a budget. Whether you're in between card orders, you're having a special event, or you're just starting out and don't want to make a huge business card order right away, these cards are a great solution. Rather, separate each card by folding the edges inward.

I finally settled for the totally blank card setup that I was able to get access to.

The card stock is very good quality, if a little thin for some people's taste.I followed the instructions to go online and download a template.

I recommend printing just one card per try until you get it right.
