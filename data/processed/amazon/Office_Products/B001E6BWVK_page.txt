Anyway, QuickNotes Business Notebook where about one 1/3 of the page (the bottom) is yellow and stands out looked interesting.I've now used it for several different meeting and personal uses and here what I've found that works well:In a business meeting, you can take short notes on the top part of the page but put all the Action Items that are assigned to you on the bottom in the highlighted area along with the due dates and contact info. The page and date have a section on top and is highlighted in blue. However, an 80 page notebook for $6? The page has regular lined sections and a yellow sub-section for notes that you want to refer to quickly. Not to mention, on each page, the words &#34;QuickNotes&#34; appear at the top in a large, silly font.For me, this is unusable. Each page has a label for page and date at the top and in the middle is the regular line set up. Each page is in full Quick Note format, blue lined top with plenty of room for writing, about 2/3 the page. The bottom 1/3 the page is the yellow area that is pre-highlighted for your most important notes and take-aways. The bottom fourth of each page is a yellow &#34;quick notes&#34; section. The page and date are on the top of each page.This is an easy way to stay organized at meetings. On each page, you can list what has been accomplished (i.e., 9:45AM talked to...11AM received a rejection from, etc.,)  In the Quick Notes (the yellow section of the page) - I list what has to be accomplished during that particular day; whether that be laundry or finishing off a short story.My only complaint with this is that it is only 80 pages long - to be truly useful it should be 90 (so that it would include three full months of data). Each page is divided into 3 sections, a title/date section, general notes section, and a highlighted notes section. I love the binding an it allows each page to lay perfectly flat which is not the case with my favorite brand composition notebook which features a glued binding.Recommended! Unless you will use the entire page, you will be left with a very expensive note pad with an &#34;ooh shiny&#34; cover.The best advice I can give you is to look at the product images.
