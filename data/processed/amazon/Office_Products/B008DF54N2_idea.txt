The idea is excellent. Post-it Full Adhesive Roll is a wonderful idea. This is a creative idea. Simple idea. I love the idea of getting the perfect length of Post-it notes or labels depending on the usage, because I often have to cut the larger full-adhesive Post-It notes with scissors to get the size and shape I want. This is a pretty good idea if you ask me. It's a great idea because you can stick the tape practically anywhere. This is a great idea. 3M has taken the idea of Post-its and applied it to a tape-like dispensary. Great idea! I like the idea of these sticky notes in a roll. This is a pretty cool idea from the people at Post-It. I really love this idea. It's a great idea, especially when you need just a little piece for sticking on something, to label, mark a page, etc.
