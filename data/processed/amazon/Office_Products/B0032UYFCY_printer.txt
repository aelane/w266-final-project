This printer does everything. This printer is what Kodak calls "all-in-one". I find that this printer performs exactly as I need. Kodak ESP 7250 All-in-One Printer is a great little wireless printer. This Kodak printer is a really great printer at this price point, and has a lot of versatility! *  The printer sometimes gives us a paper jam error message, even when there isn't a jam. I found this printer very easy to set up, and I can't imagine many people having a problem with it, even if you're not very tech savvy. I've been pleasantly surprised by this printer. This printer continues to print well for overall documents. I had this printer on a printer stand in the corner of my office for a few weeks. This printer was working nicely churning out handful of documents a day for three weeks. Sadly, it caused my printer to cease working from that point. The printer cannot be found on the network. I've restarted the printer and the computer. As a wired printer, it works perfectly when connected to my computer by a standard USB printer cable (borrowed from my other printer). I did have to reinstall the printer software, and I am happy overall with the print quality and ink cost.The scanner is very fast and I also like the fact that it has a card reader on the printer. Overall, I'm pleased with this printer, but I have a few reservations. All in one for this printer means that you can scan documents and photos, and use it as a copy machine as well as a printer for your computer.The other main issue is that there is a bug in the printer driver such that if you have set your default duplexing option to automatic, then you will get an unusual error if you try to print from the photo paper tray.There are some nice pluses for this printer:1) You can do quite a bit without having to have it connected to a computer:  You can plug in your camera to a USB port in front, you can plug a memory card from your camera, or plug in a USB drive. You need to install the printer driver software on all the computers you will be using with the printer.Some drawbacks:1) The included software "Kodak Home Center" uses custom dialogs for browsing for pictures, using very skinny scroll bars, making it a little frustrating to navigate around. The printer status tray application is always running when running the Home Center software, you can right-click on it and choose Exit, but it comes right back.2) Initial setup (unpacking and setting up, and installing the software) takes a while. Not to mention that the printer software was able to download the latest version from the web! Well this would have made a nice printer for the price.

What sets this printer above the rest is the low cost of printing.So if you aren't super picky about your photos and you want to save some money in the long run, while still getting a solid printer, then the Kodak ESP 7250 is the way to go.If my review was helpful, please click the "YES" button below.

Size is much smaller than the HP 7410 printer, though the HP includes a Fax (something that this all in one does not) and the HP also has a sheet feeder (something that the Kodak unit also does not have).

Although it says that it is an all in one printer, it does not support Fax!!
