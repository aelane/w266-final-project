This is not a printer for your 4 by 6 inch snapshots on your 3.2 MP point and shoot. It is a printer that takes full advantage of professional and semi-professional DSLR cameras such as theCanon Digital Rebel XTi 10.1MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Lens (Black), orNikon D3 12.1MP FX Digital SLR Camera (Body Only)or my ownNikon D80 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera (Body only).It is also a printer for your best work only. This printer is designed for the photo enthusiast who wants very, very high print quality, but doesn't want to spend top dollar on higher-end models such as the HP 9180. The printer is huge: 27 x 17 x 10 inches and it weighs 38 pounds. It is essentially the same printer...perhaps even a little better as it has benefited from whatever refinements and upgrades came after the B9180 (like the sleep mode).I have both and they are great printers. Well made printer but is quite large and heavy so not for small office situation. The printer is very large (about 27 inches wide) and weighs in at nearly 40 pounds - make sure you have room for it before you order. This printer uses 8 cartridges as about $30 a pop. I find this very interesting.So all in all, a wonderful printer. The Photosmart Pro B8850 is a professional-grade printer from HP designed as a cheaper version of theHP Photosmart Pro B9180 Printer. The printer looks great, and it comes with all the ink to get started (8 different inks), plus  25 sheets of HP Photo Paper, and a folder to store your paper in so it doesn't get damaged (at almost $2 a sheet you will be thankful for it). If you don't use your printer everyday and sometimes go weeks without using it, this prevents the inks from drying out and conserves the print heads.These three changes are the only real differences I could find. If we had actually purchased this printer, I estimate we would have broken even on the price in a few weeks.Update April 2012 - I stopped using this printer a couple years ago after continual paper jams to the point where it would shred the paper, and I would spend the next twenty minutes picking out scraps of paper from it.
