I started carrying this little notebook to meetings and just taking notes. The Ampad notebook seems to work pretty well for my way of doing things. An average cheap notebook doesn't cut it for me.I was impressed with the Ampada Versa. You can customize the notebook by easily moving the plastic section dividers, meaning that your notebook doesn't have to be divided into three sections that are exactly the same size, like when you buy a pre-divided notebook. This is perfect.All in all, more than I expect from a notebook... :)This notebook has a lot of extra features that other notebooks do not have, such as a moveable bookmark, post it notes and removable arrows, extra pockets, etc.Everything is right there at your fingertips so you don't have to make extra trips to gather up your supplies.The reason I chose this particular notebook was that it had the movable pages feature. I do really like this notebook, it is very practical, but that would be the only downside for me. Almost $10 for a notebook this size seems rather much. I've been looking for a small "permanent" notebook to keep information about my computer and programs... and this appears to be what I needed! This little notebook offers a lot of flexibility. I may be dull-witted, but I didn't realize at first that the notebook is refillable, that it is really a new take on the loose leaf, and that the sturdy plastic binder and other elements can be used again and again. This notebook is not full-sized - perfect for my use. This little notebook is great. This clever little notebook helps me out with all that. This little notebook gives you lots of options for getting organized. I really like this notebook, but wish it were in a more lively color. That's where it goes back to being a notebook! This notebook could be used for projects, classes, journal or anything you would like to keep organized. With this notebook there are plastic dividers that are so handy! I like this notebook a lot.I like the size.I like how easy it is to remove pages - no tearing involved.I like that it comes with sticky flags and sticky notes.I like the storage pocket in the back.I like the cover - it is plastic, and will not wear out quickly.This is a very well thought out design, and a very functional item.I use it very often.Highly recommended The Ampad Versa notebook is a definite crossover between notebook, binder, and organizer all in one! This is a small notebook, only 5  x 8  inches, but it really does pack a big punch. The very back of the notebook houses three different colored plastic "tabs," which can be moved to any point in the notebook. The Ampad Versa notebook is a must have for all note takers, who want the ease of having a binder, notebook, and organizer all in one place! I'm a notebook junkie, so I was very happy to receive this Ampad Versa spiral notebook for review. That being said, this is going to be my "go to" notebook for some of my office work and I'm pleased that I can order page refills. sized notebook) so when it arrived and it was the size of a hardback book, I was a little confused. And finally, this notebook is priced comparably to other mini-notebooks/journals on the market. This is a very straightforward notebook. This is a high-quality notebook in a small form format. This is funny, because here is a notebook that actually NEEDS instructions: I actually overlooked that the back cover was a folder.This thing is like the Swiss Army Knife of notebooks...pages, dividers, and even the covers themselves can be added or removed as needed. I really love this notebook. The notebook's cover is also very sturdy and reliable. This notebook will not fall apart after a few months of use.There is also a tab with stickers that can be used to highlight any part of your writing. I really like this notebook. This notebook is basically a low-end version of the Circa notebook made by Levenger. This notebook goes with me to the office every day in my backpack and still performs flawlessly. I've only had this notebook for a week, so the durability remains a mystery for now. So far, I am enjoying using this one notebook in place of the cheaper more traditional ones I usually bring to meetings. However, this new notebook just doesn't make the grade.It does come complete with flexible page bookmarks, as well as sticky pads and arrows for pointing out highlights and important notes.The 6" x 9" size is perfect for purse or briefcase.I just can't endorse the flimsy construction or lack of proper pocket space.I give this product one [1] star and a thumbs down.

Ordered this notebook for one of my kids.

The notebook itself is the same kind of covered pasteboard as school binders were in the 60s and 70s (anyone remember Blue Horse?)
