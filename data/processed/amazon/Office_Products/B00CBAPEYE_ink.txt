I was pleased that it only required four ink cartridges, as opposed to five or six I have encountered with some of the other Epson models. Although all ink is pricey, with this model you can replace single cartridges as needed and they do have extended cartridges that are not wildly expensive.For a low end printer, this one offers good performance and many useful features. Don't know how quickly small ink cartridges will last2. There are four ink cartridges and the price of the Epson replacement are less than $25. The ink cartridges are very small and I don't expect them to last long at all and for the size they are not cheap. Also, it comes with minimal ink cartridges, meaning you won't get much printing done after a few pages or color-rich photos. It uses a common Epson ink cartridge (200) but I recommend buying the 200XL if you do a lot of printing because the basic "tanks" run out quickly. The ink for this machine is cheaper than normal. It is also easy to install the ink. The ink drys pretty fast as well. I love that I can check the ink levels through the printer software so that I will not be caught by surprise when the supply is running low.I have primarily utilized a much older Samsung laser printer until I installed the Epson XP-410 Wireless All-In-One inkjet. Although it uses a different ink base than the XP800, I did not see a significant difference in drying time with glossy paper.With Epson Connect, essentially there are six options available, some dependent on the device to be employed and in many respects they are overlapping for a specific device. (2) Four ink cartridges (your typical black, cyan, magenta, yellow). For T200X, you spend a little more on ink, but cost per page ends up a tad less. (3) Goes through ink quickly (tanks are small). The proprietary ink is how they make money. If you see the ink cartridges on sale, stock up! I go through ink too fast on these ink jet printers. The ink is moderately priced and I do recommend sticking with Epson brands as I've had issues in the past with generic ink clogging up the print heads. HP uses an ink that lays on the top of the photo paper that is coated with a ceramic film. Epson uses an ink that penetrates the top layer of its photo paper - the result is better color and longevity. I wish they were a little less costly, but I do appreciate the ink quality.WiFi was easy enough to set up. The ink is fairly cheap ranging from $12 to 15.
