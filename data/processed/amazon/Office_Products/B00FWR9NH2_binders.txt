binders are on his school supply list. Eventually, all binders start to have a misalignment in the ring, but this heat duty ring seems to be much sturdier than others.It looks good on the shelf with my papers. Most binders are pretty basic, so there's not much new to say about this EXCEPT for one kind of neat feature: a one handed opening button. And compared to some other binders, this ring mechanism feels secure where it attaches to the spine. These are pretty much basic binders with a few bells and whistles that make them easier to use than other brands. I only notice the binders doing that after they have been exposed to high temperatures such as we are having in the south right now. When I buy binders I want them to last. I'm so tired of binders that quit closing perfectly after a short period of time. I like &#34;D&#34; ring binders and this is a &#34;D&#34; ring binder. Unlike some binders I have used in the past, the covers on this one are not flimsy. I have seven of these binders in varying thickness and all of them are excellent choices for holding important presentations and documentation.This is marketed as having Extra Durable Hinges and they are indeed quite sturdy compared to the lower end binders we buy in bulk. Overall these binders are expensive but they will last a lot longer than the average binder that you pick up at your local retail store. We use binders quite a bit in our home. I use binders for all my household paperwork, and so do my kids. The binders are made of Polypro, which is reputed to last ten times longer than regular vinyl. Most of the binders I have owned were simply made of cardboard that were encased in cheap plastic. Overall, these binders are highly recommended.Joseph B. Hoyos It's smoother & shinier than other binders, and the heat-weld seam at the joints looks different. I get binders like these for the kids for school and they seem to uphold very well. I abuse these binders with a great deal of use while carrying it from office to home to classroom every semester. We go through binders around here like crazy, with four kids in school. Many binders have two tabs to push, and you have to really crank on them to open the rings. I have used Wilson Jones binders for years. I love binders. I don&#8217;t normally get binders with the clear, plastic cover because they (out of use) tend to look stretched out over time. I use binders like this to organize my coupons. Most of my three-ring binders are white, so I was looking forward to getting this black one. I can say that it has taught me NOT to buy binders online sight unseen. This is among the lightest, flimsiest, and weakest binders that I own. It is one of the better more durable binders and the one inch thickness is just what I need it for in this case and that is to hold my medical papers I get after each doctors visit. When purchasing binders, one needs to consider the use you have intended for them. With my larger 2" Wilson Jones binders that have the single touch closure, the pages tend to get caught on the rings, but these rings are so small that I don't tend to have problems.
