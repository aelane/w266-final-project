Yes, my desk is messy and covered with papers. Most of us reach inside our desk drawer for our post it notes, or we leave them out in the open, lying on our desk tops, for quick access. My desk is very cluttered so it was nice to be able to hang them on the drawer and know right where they were. I like to have my desk clutter free. I also have a desk top Post-it Pop-Up dispenser, in black, weighted and all. I have one of these sitting on my desk and another in my craft room. "It's actually more attractive than the desk holder, and can be adhered to walls or the refrigerator...the chalkboard. I always have to go back to my desk when I need a Post-it Note and now it's handy! desk, counter, etc.) This one is useful to declutter crowded desk areas, but may end up in that drawer, considering its plain looks and specialty supplies.Other notepads will fit in the slot (which has a spring-loaded mechanism to hold the pad in place), but won't dispense as intended from the middle slot. I have it right on my desk (you can mount it as well, if you'd like) and when I need to write a note I have the post-its and pen handy. Handy, nice-size, attractive on the desk. You can stand it on your desk, or stick it to your computer tower.
