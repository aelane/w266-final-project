If you've been using a regular mouse pad, you'll probably be very happy with the extra space assuming that it fits on your desk. The mouse glides effortlessly, and there aren't any tracking aberrations. Probably the last real mouse pad I owned came in my limited edition Max Payne box in the tender year of 2001; and while our titular tormented painkiller has gone on to a franchise in the spirit of Die Hard, that particular mouse pad died quick.So I better get used to Logitech&#8217;s low-friction G440, because this sleek black slab of plastic pad is too hard to die soon.&#60;The Black Album&#62;Logitech don&#8217;t make left-handed mice, sorry to say, so I use aRazer Naga 2014 Left Handed MMO Gaming Mouse. As many here have mentioned, it is huge for a mouse pad. Your mouse glides effortlessly on this pad. Very good mouse pad. I use a G500 mouse and tracking is perfect on this pad. It really feels like my mouse just got a pair of ice skates on a skating rink. Excellent mouse pad. It doesn't look like it will get worn out, like other mouse pads. It just works very well, and convinced me back to using mouse pads.A while ago, I gave up on mouse pads. I've also found it's very slightly smoother to move the mouse across this pad than the 4HD pad.The downsides?1.)

Also, while mouse pads will inevitably get dirty over time, a hard surface has the benefit of being easily wiped down with a paper towel and water.In terms of overall value proposition, I think this product is priced a bit high, though, it really does delivery on its promise.

By being able to move my mouse faster and more accurately, certain game metrics such as Actions Per Minute (Starcraft) measurably improved.Notes:1) The only scenario where I prefer cloth/thick foam pads is if I'm using a mechanical ball mouse, though I haven't touched one in years.2) I tried the Logitech G440 on a variety of mice and I didn't have any tracking issues.

This mouse pad is literally twice as large as my current one.
