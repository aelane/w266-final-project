I most recently had theEpson WorkForce 630 Color Inkjet All-in-One (C11CB07201)in my home and I liked it really well except that I could never get the wireless feature to work. The Epson Workforce Pro WP-4530 All-in-One is much bigger than your average home printer. Pro's:  We are enjoying this Epson for home use. For a home office or a small office, it's a wonderfully viable option.I'll start by saying that I received this Epson as a review unit. I installed it in my home office and temporarily placed it on the print stand that my wireless HP has occupied the past two years. It is almost too large for home use, unless you have a big home office. I'm Dorothy, finding myself in Oz, and not wanting to go home again.The setup of this printer took aout 20 minutes (12 of which were just waiting for the ink cartridges to "pump). Let's be honest, not every home has enormous printing needs--this is something I might recommend if you actually work out of your home office or are even a small business owner. (Also handy when I'm away from home and want to print something since I don't have a VPN set up at home.) But if you have a home office and need a printer to handle a small businesss priniting needs, this is probably what you need.The one problem is again, the set-up time. It is not heavy to move or lift but it is a little large for a home office.
