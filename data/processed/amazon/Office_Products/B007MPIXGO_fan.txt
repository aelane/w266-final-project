There is a cooling fan powered by a supplied USB cable - the fan does use laptop battery power. The fan does make a bit of noise. The fan did help cool my 15 inch MacBook Pro. The fan runs at the expense of battery life, about 20% decrease overall. The fan, hub, and lamp are nice little additions. If the fan was quieter and used less power, I'd really love this table.I was provided a sample for review. The fan comes on automatically when there is power available and the light has a switch and will tuck underneath when not in use. Not too surprising.I have stopped using the fan and light. It's sturdy enough and functional, but the fan and light sounded better than they turned out to be and the finish on the top seems like it will not be very durable.

I don't need a fan for the netbook, though.

I connected a USB powered fan, and that worked.I'd prefer the ports be located on the right side instead of the left, because my netbook sits on the left over the fan, so there's more room on the right to sit my devices.Lastly, there's a little drawer.

I also would have preferred the fan to be dead center instead of off center.Everything else about this desk is perfect though.
