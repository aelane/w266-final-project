You have to subscribe to caller ID with your phone company, and not all the caller labels are always understandable, but the nice thing is that you have the option of putting in your own labels for folks in your address book. We bought this phone to replace an older model of the same phone that we have had for several years. Really a nice phone. I "upgraded" from theUniden TRU-8885 3HS Cordless Speakerphone 5.8GHzthinking that the Panasonic phone system would clear up occasional interference from other wireless devices. UPDATE 3/24/10:  I have had this phone for close to a year now and have notices some gliches. I have had the phone company out twice thinking it was the lines but they never found any problems. I was putting off buying such a nice phone, but my previous phones were interfering with the wireless network when the phone rang. Well, this phone DOES NOT INTERFERE AT ALL! I have one phone right next to my laptop and the wireless connection doesn't even flinch when there's an incoming call. I found the setup very intuitive, and every stored phone number replicates automatically to all the phones. I don't know how it does it, but this phone can tell when we have a Verizon voice mail (I have turned off the answering machine).
