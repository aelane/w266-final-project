The numerous photo printing capabilities available from the control panel are okay but not likely to be used although it does not hurt to have them there. The photo printing is unbelievably crisp and, in my tests, the colors are the most faithful to the original images of any home printer I've used. I wouldn't rely on this as a dedicated photo printer, however, and will go into this in the Cons- Sleek appearance- Touch screen interface is user-friendly (for most functions) and easy to navigate- Software / driver installation is straightforward- Decent paper capacityCONS:- Very large (takes up almost the entire surface of my credenza)- Color printing eats a lot of ink, and...- 6 ink cartridges (yes, you need all 6) may result in higher quality, but a relatively small black in capacity means you'll be getting more refills than you might be bargaining for if you bought this primarily for printing black-and-white documents- Slow startup time- Print-via-Wifi issues from some computers... see below- Printed pages fall to the floor unless you fully extend the fragile trayWIFI Printing was tough for me for a while. Epson states it has the fastest 4x6 photo print speed.8. I don't do that may b&W; or gray tone photo printing. Color photo printing quality is excellent and does 4x6" pics as well as the drug store digital photo printing when using the same quality paper. I have also used some cheap thin photo stock which even provided very good results (although longevity may be the issue with this paper). I have the Workforce 840, an older Epson Stylus photo R320, and now this Artisan 837.Before I gush about the Artisan, I will say that I purchased the Workforce (W/F) this past spring after careful research into both the Artisan line and the Workforce line. So I decided to try the exact same photo in regular 'photo' setting and it took about 8 seconds!!! The 837 has a much improved photo quality. We've printed out 3 8x10's on the Epson photo paper and about a dozen 4x6's on high-quality photo paper we already had, and compared them with the same photographs printed and picked up from our local drugstore. From photo, disc, or docment printing, to faxing and copying with vibrant colors, there are few machines that can compete with this one.Set up is relatively easy, but it takes some practice to figure out the CD/DVD printing function. I'm happy with it and the great photo quality was a added plus I didn't expect despite the product description. Great photo printing quality3. It just automatically goes back to tray 1, where my photo paper is. Great photo quality, loaded with features, and each color can be replaced individually so no ink wasted.You can even insert an SD card with photos and print directly! Great photo printing, b&w; document are crisp and clear, operating costs seem reasonable, printing speeds (while not that important to me) are adequate. I was expecting a photo printer that would create "quality" prints slightly below that of an actual photoshop, but the Artisan is way more than this!First of all, it's incredibly easy to set up (assuming you have a wireless connection). But the photo prints are incredible. Using the two free 4X6 photo papers that came with the printer I was amazed at the quality of the prints - they look like they were developed professionally. I don't know what else you would want from a photo printer.

More expensive, dedicated photo printers (e.g.

Like all photo printers, the print quality depends on the quality of the original photo, the paper stock and the print speed.

When picking up a 4x6" photo from the 4" edge there is about half as much bend vs the Premium Paper.
