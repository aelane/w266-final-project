I started with the 2 phone set, but quickly ordered an additional phone and charger for my small condo. Overall, I like this phone. This phone also has excellent range and the voice conversation clarity is awesome. Overall, this is a great phone and the price is good. I highly recommend this phone. Oh, the phone handsets also come with 2mm phone jacks so you can use hands free with a headset which I love. When I look for a new phone, I always check Panasonic models first, and always end up buying them.I've had this phone with three handsets for about 3 years, and have been quite happy with it. Our last phone came from Wal-Mart, and it lasted less than a month. We finally stumbled onto this phone and, in all honesty, both believe that it is the best phone we've ever seen.

If your phone is in your bedroom, and you want to turn the ringer off at night so as not to get a wrong number call in the middle of the night, you need to turn the ringer off.

Used this phone for about a week, before returning it.

We compared this phone with the regular phone,which came with the service and the other one was much better.It could be an issue with that specific piece we got.
