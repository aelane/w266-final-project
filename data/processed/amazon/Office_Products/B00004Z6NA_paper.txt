When you put the wrong paper in your printer, you get very weird results.P.S. However, finally, I got around to trying the 8 x 10 paper. I had some paper from another supplier and when I used it on the Epson, the ghostly images were terrible. If you're planning on using HP photo paper with an Epson printer; take my advice and give it away instead - then buy some of this Epson paper for awesome results!As far as the quality of the paper goes, it feels just like the paper used by professional labs. Which means that from now on I'll be shopping for Epson photo paper as well, and my stockpile of old HP paper has become useless. This photo paper was quite cheap price wise but works great in my Lexmark, HP, and Epson printers with no problem at all. This paper is high quality and produces very true colors and sharpness. I usually used Kodak paper, but I ordered this largely on comments about it being instant dry and very durable. I had actually recently bought an Epson Workforce 845, so I decide to try the Epson paper as well. I will be purchasing more of this photo paper in the future as it nice photo paper. I started using this paper in 2005, and I'm still using it. I'm currently using the paper with an Epson XP-850 printer. It was smallish and held photo paper in its trays. This Premium paper did the trick. Kodak and HP paper did not work at all. I was shopping for 4x6 photo paper for my Epson printer. This was literally the only paper I could find in this size !! Epson photo paper leaves images clear and bright as well as smudge free. Overall a great photo paper and the price is great! This paper works well with the Epson printer but I would not expect any less from Epson. what more can you ask for from photo paper?

I purchased this paper because it was the cheapest brand out there- and printing your own photos is an expensive hobby.

I now use Epson paper for all my 4x6 photos and I save money!
