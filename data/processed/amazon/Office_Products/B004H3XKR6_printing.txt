Very nicely done.Duplex printing. yes!++ quick and fast-drying printing with decent quality++ scanner with ADF, dual side support, and USB destination++ 2 paper trays for different paper sizes++ comfortably sized touchscreenI can't think of any cons to this printer. Two-sided printing collates and prints so the pages just need to be flipped over when removed from the output tray. I always have it set to two sided printing, minimal ink use, and print last page first) so that I get everything the way I want to, right away. The printing, copying, and scanning features all work well. I have not tried double sided printing, but don't expect issues either.It is a very nice multi-function printer for the price. Photo printing on 4x6 photopaperwas faster than any other inkjets I've tried. Althoughthe printing setting is limited (to paper size, orientation, and border),the quality was good.What's disappointing was that Epson did not make this printer compatiblewith Apple's airprint feature like HP does with its current models. It completed the printing in under 35 seconds -- or equivalently, over 10 pages a minute, or 5.83 seconds per page - in High Quality mode! I was puzzled that printing and scanning worked fine, but copying did not. If you only need printing, faxing, and scanning, this might be for you, but I have to think there are better options out there. For most of my printing needs, I had been using an HP 309n, but it was slow. I've mostly been using this for black and white printing and the black ink looks crisp and I haven't noticed any smudging.The scanner is about average and is in line for what I would expect of an all-in-one unit.Overall, this is a great printer, especially for a small office or anyone who values speed in printing. The fast two sided printing on this model is really cool. Most of the printing we do is black and white. The 2-sided printing was one feature that prompted me to get this model instead of one of the other WorkForce printers.I like the touch pad/control panel on the printer. It includes printing, scanning, faxing and copying.During my review, I will compare this printer to the other printer I received via Vine, theLexmark Pinnacle Pro901 All-in-One Printerand also the printer I purchased for myself for photo printing, theCanon PIXMA MP990 Wireless Inkjet Photo All-In-One Printer (3749B002).In terms of unboxing the printer, it was pretty simple. *** Black and white printing is (at least) equal in quality to black and white laser printing: sharp, well-defined edges, smooth curves, excellent contrast, no haziness or blur anywhere. As I mentioned before, auto-duplex printing is a big plus for me, and it works flawless here and very quickly. Our printing needs are for documents, homework, and some photos. The Epson Workforce 840 more than handles our printing needs, it is a fantastic printer.
