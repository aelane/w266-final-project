I received the red binder only. Meanwhile, this is a nice, colorful binder. You can get a one-inch binder individually for about $3-5, so you'll have to decide if the extra durability of these particular binders is worth the price.All in all, recommended. The binder can be wiped clean, and it&#8217;s sturdy enough to provide years and years of service. This binder is perfect for school, office, or home. I don&#8217;t see how much binder technology has advanced over the years (aside from Mitt Romney&#8217;s special binders ;)  ) &#8230; Mead has always been the standard since I started school over 40 years ago.WHAT IT IS AND WHAT IT DOES- 1 inch 3-ring binder that accommodates standard 8.5&#8221; x 11&#8221; documents.- As opposed the common &#8220;O ring&#8221;, these binders incorporate a &#8220;D ring&#8221; which allows the contents of the binder to line up straight in the binder.- There are pockets inside the front and back covers.- There are insert sleeves for the front and back covers, as well as the spine which allow the binders to be customized/labeled.- The plastic cover/shell has tightly &#8220;stitched&#8221; seams that add durability and appear less likely to separate or fray at the corners.Overall, a solid binder with the added benefit of a D-ring. Overall, this is a nice binder, but nothing special. The three-ring binder has rings that are easy to open and close. This binder has inside pockets and you can also insert a cover and a label on the spine. The binder itself is okay, a few bumps in the plastic. This is a pretty well made binder, with four D-RINGS and a front cover that you can out your own cover into. Each binder is solidly constructed and feature three D-ring holders to keep papers, pencil bags, and just about anything else that has three holes in it in place. Also, while I only received one binder to review, this pack apparently features four binders, each one a different color.Highly recommended. This is a very nice, sturdy binder. I have found that binder buyers can be quite diverse in their opinions of what is best for a particular use. :) I originally thought they were quite pricey, but later realized that Amazon only sent me one binder and the price on the page is for a pack of 4. But when you are using the binder as a reference binder, the D-Ring makes it easy to loose. I only received 1 binder, so I can not comment on a 4 pack.The binder is what I would consider a mid weight binder. I received a nice one-inch binder from Mead. The binder seems to be quite sturdy and should easily hold up to a year's use or more at school or the office.The binders are available in four assorted colors in a pack, or four all-of-one color packs. A nice 1 inch binder. Received only the purple binder, and I would not say it seems particularly durable. All around, a good binder.M
