This board is perfect for my needs. I prop this board against the base of the easel holding my permanent sign. This dry-erase board is the perfect size to install in a kitchen for home communications. The board is easy to clean and seems like it will serve its purpose for many years. At first I thought my board was stained. This is a sturdy board for home use, but I don't think it would hold up to an office environment. The board is not as heavy as you might think. Although this board is a bit flimsy, it performs well. I put this board up in my grandson's room and use it as a guide when he does good things, like going potty by himself, picking up his toys, eating all of his meals, being good, using good manners, etc. The board is good size and I can put 20 different chore/good things on it with no problem. If you're using this board leaning up against a wall or in a window (like a restaurant), it would work fine.The actual board itself works well and the pen markings erase easily. The board was enclosed in a cardboard box with very light padding. The board itself was in good condition and dent-free. We have only had the board a week, but so far we are very happy. The board also comes with one pen that writes well. So far the board has been very easy to clean.At this point, we do not want to attached the board to a specific wall so I cannot review that aspect. The board's surface does erase easily and cleanly. The board comes with four screws and plastic anchors that work well. The board itself had a minor dent in it too, but not so bad we couldn't use it. The board comes with two magnets for holding papers, and of course you can add more. I have put this white board to great use. It works extremely well as a white board as you might imagine it would.I have purchased other white boards and never received a couple of magnets with them as I did with this one. The board is large enough (24"x 36") to hold your average size poster.The unit is solid yet light with all the hardware you need to attach it to a wall, permanently or temporarily. Overall this is a good board with everything you need. The board is very easy to hang, the magnets work well, and it came with one dry erase marker. The board can be hung horizontally or vertically so it is very adaptable to many locations. Perhaps they wanted it to work even if you used the board in portrait mode, but even then it would be perhaps half the length of the board.

If this board were being sold at a rock-bottom price I might recommend it for someone who wants something extremely cheap but functional.

I had set the board in a spot where I could test it out for purposes of review.

This board came with two broken corner caps so there is no way I would be able to hang it by using screws through the caps.
