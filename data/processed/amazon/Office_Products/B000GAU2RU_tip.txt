I really like the retractable tip since it protects a delicate part of the pencil. The tip is retractable, nice touch for the thin tube of the 0.3mm tube, they can bend rather easily (which will ruin a pencil).The clip has been noted by others as a bit flimsy, it is the functional but weak link. Upon taking the tip off and the grip there is plastic threads and plastic barrel underneath a metal "skin". To be honest though I love the retractable tip and it strikes a very nice line. It had a retractable tip and it's eraser, while small like so many others, was on the better side. Nevertheless, it's the best retractable tip out there, and it does so while keeping a very solid/stiff tip, more solid than my old favorite Double Knock.The other big desire for a pocket pencil is a big and high quality eraser. If you pre-retract the tip, it slides nicely over your pocket material, but as mentioned above if you don't, it can be a bit hard to, mostly because the "V" you have to get the fabric into is quite small.Overall, while it doesn't quite measure up to the GraphGear 500 overall and it's price tag is in the high range ($10-$20) making it not as compelling as the Zebra M301 from a value perspective, it's still the 3rd pencil I'll keep in my arsenal as my pocket pencil. The retractable tip is excellent. Love that it retracts into the tip. Not only does it protect the fragile tip, it also prevents the pencil from stabbing a leg or ruining pants in situations when front pocket carry is the only option.For people like me, who are not draftsmen/architects and who will just use this pencil for writing, note that the tip is a bit further out from your hand than with other (non-drafting) mechanical pencils. It also functions to keep the collapsible tip extended for writing. The tip retracts when you engage the clip. No broken leads because the tip retracts!
