However, the label for this product was not one of them. This label is very pretty and has a sophisticated design to it. I used a pre-designed label & created my own text with a curve at the top. It was especially hard for those who didn't use a pre-printed label. If you don't find what you're looking for, you can also design your own label with easy-to-use drag and drop graphics. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.So I ended up creating my own label in Word measuring the dimensions of the actual labels WITH A RULER and then doing some test prints to make sure it was all lined up. I love having these for a little label to put on a card or gift. I used the online Avery label design site which is the best way to create your labels but it helps if you have a lot of graphics of your own to use as the ones available on the site are somewhat limited. I would say just make sure the label isn't too big for what you plan on using it for, but otherwise you can't go wrong with these! Unfortunately, after downloading the &#8220;Wizard&#8221; from Avery, this label (08214) is NOT supported. That works out to about $0.20 per label. A sloppy label on a  container or box is something I've always avoided.
