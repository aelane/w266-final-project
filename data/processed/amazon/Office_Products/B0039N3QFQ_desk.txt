I have this on my desk for convenience, but my cats LOVE to sit there. So it's very easy to slide around on the desk but it remains secure when you're pull up a strip of tape. I don't really need to take up valuable desk space with another dispenser. The desk dispenser has a little suction cup on the bottom, to hold the dispenser in place while you take a strip of tape, and it works pretty well. Surprisingly strong - I have to slide it to the desk's edge to lift it up, which is fine. It does not want to adhere to my desk surfaces at all, when I pull on the tape, the whole thing comes up with the tape still inside. -- anyway, my desk is wood, and it works just fine.I don't want to take up desk space with this, however, so it's in my "gift wrap bag" along with a pair of scissors, bows, and wrapping paper. I knew I wouldn't necessarily use it on my desk top, but definitely on the kitchen table top when wrapping any kind of gift. I've tried it on my desk (highly polished solid wood), my butcher block table (unfinished wood), my kitchen table (solid wood), my engineered quartz counter top, and the metal legs for my computer monitor. Unfortunately, it won't stick to my desk, which is ceramic tile so I can't pull out the tape without holding it down. Who needs more desk clutter? When it was on my desk, it didn't suction as advertised, it just slid all around the surface.It sits in a drawer and, to be honest, I forget it's there which means I'm more likely to grab, use, and replace the regular scotch tape dispensers. It is designed to be placed on a desk or other smooth surface, freeing up a hand while working with the tape. It sits on your desk or table, not moving because of the excellent suction design until you need it. It slides around the desk. It will easily slide all over your desk, but you'll have to slide it to the edge to pick it up. I set this on my desk and it does not sunction too well. I pushed it down on my desk and took several pieces of tape out waiting for it to jam, or the tape to stop coming, but it didn't. I could slide it on the desk, but it held on tight, making it very easy to grab and pull up pre-cut pieces of tape. To remove it from your desk, just slide it to the edge and it loses its "magical" grip. Because it sticks to the desk, it is less likely to wander away and get lost. It does not mar the desk (like an adhesive would) and it also does not require a glassy smooth surface (like a suction cup would).I
