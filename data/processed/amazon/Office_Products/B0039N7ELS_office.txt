)Good for office, home and classroom applications.Benefits: easy to use: just flip the cover and go, non-messy/ideal for children, compact and easy to store. Our office was using double-sided tape to apply insurance pictures to 8.5 x 11 paper to add to files. It has become one of my favorite office products. For one-time office presentations, I think the Scotch Adhesive Dot Roller would do the job quite nicely and easily. And I just found it handy to have around the office and house. Love that I got to use this and keep it handy around the office! This is one of those office products that you don't actually need (come on, it is just another glue), but when you have it you really glad you got it. The adhesive holds strong for usual office applications, as it always happens with Scotch products. It is almost impossible to visit an office supply store and Not find a new Scotch product and that is wonderful. I am usually extremely skeptical of office gadgets, especially ones with this much plastic.The dot roller has proven useful though. Great for scrapbooking and crafting, as well as the normal office use. A VERY handy office gadget. Scotch makes great office and home office products that stick and this one is one of their best.
