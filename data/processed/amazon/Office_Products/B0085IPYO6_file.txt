It is easily removed from the file drawer to view the contents - great looking! It can alsobe a great file box for regular stuff toowith divided tabs.It come folded and all you do is unfold it into place.It sits right up without any problems. The Smead MO file box is a nice, but basic cardboard file box.We have file folder boxes and there's no distinguishable difference from these Smead Mo and the generic, Office Max brand.Make no mistake, these are just file as a file paper storage box that can hold about 500 sheets or about 7-10 magazines. I got this file box and it is perfect. I quit using conventional file folders a while back and now just use expanding pocket folders. This file box seemed like a good organizer.Singular good:>Slightly larger than an 8 1/2 x 11 letter size; this box can hold and organize lighter items such as school reports, magazines, files, comics, to ad circulars, etc.Multiple bads:>Thin, blue-coated cardboard box that was already dented during shipment (arrived in a large padded envelope).>Weak base design that won't be able to hold heavier items.>Odd handle placement with one lower than the other and on a bendable flap making it difficult to use when full.>$9.99 (at time of review) for a very basic cardboard file storage box is ludicrous! I decided that this Smead file box is better used as a temporary storage place, flat on the floor, for papers instead of a true file box. This expandable file folder is sturdier than the dark brown ones you see most of the time. But it's good enough for storing file folders for home use. Prettier file folders and sturdier file boxes are widely available now. It will fit in file drawers and can hold standard-size letter folders. I ordered this to contain the file folders that is sold with the MO system starter kit. I've already got a great file system in my home office and my work office. So, I got this MO file "box" and the starter set of file folders and in the future the task of organizing my receipts will seem painless. This file box is meant to be part of a filing system. This file case is one of three individual items within Smead's MO (My Organizer) product line. I just love these new file boxes! The file box fits nicely in my file drawer. This file box is a sturdy little office accessory for putting project papers and odds and ends in one place. This file box is designed to keep everything organized and together. This is a 3 inch cardboard file box that holds the My Organizer color coded files. An inexpensive, well built file box made out of cardboard is a good idea. I wish the entire file box had two layers of cardboard to make the entire item stronger.I have used this for a week keeping it in my desk drawer and taking it out and putting it on my desk at times. On it's own, the file case feels awkward to use. I was hoping to use this file case as an alternative. This file box is nice and sturdy.

I mean, it's a file box, how much consideration could it take?If it isn't completely obvious from the picture, this folder box is made of cardboard.

I'm a librarian and I've seen file boxes before--even cardboard ones.

With this "file box" you actually need the outer shell of the "box" in order for it to be called a "file box" and be stored safely.
