I really loved the idea of these but when it came time to put them to use...not so much. These are a great idea for when you don't need that many tickets. It's a good idea to run a test page before printing the tickets because variations in printers may affect intended results. Easy to print on and the idea was loved for an athletic themed party. These are such a great idea! Great idea! These are a really neat idea -- pre-perforated paper for tickets with tear-offs. I really like the idea of having tear away tickets to use with my kids, and also for unique party invitations (my sons like trains). One idea we also tried was printing our design on the main ticket portion with the OR code for our website on the stub portion (we printed our logo on the other side of the stub part). I have no idea why they call it on-line printing.

Overall, it seems like a good idea.

I love the idea of these tickets.

I like the idea of the raffle ticket  with the tear away stubs being set up for an ink jet printer.
