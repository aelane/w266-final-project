(oh, they do have the label at the top/bottom to provide weight.) We use file label clear protection stickers, so the Post-it brand removeables are a little better. I've preferred the 3M label products to both store brand & Avery. If you're looking for a more temporary label with the hopes of reusing your file folders for a different purpose later (like in the case of project folders, which tend to be colored), you'll be better off purchasing the Post-It brand removable adhesive labels. I misapplied one label and when I went to gently remove it, it was done for because it wanted to stay stuck to file.I didn't mind the casualty.The labels printed up fine with my inkjet printer and the only 'issue' I had was with formatting.I'm still rocking Windows 2003 (much to my husband's dismay) and Word does NOT allow for Top alignment in the labels. Every Avery label I have ever tried I loved and this one is no different. If you are placing a label over writing or another printed label the one behind will show through a bit. Better to remove the old label before applying the new one. If you're not using them over another label, they're superior to the Avery product for the same (or cheaper) cost. Compatible with Avery 5366 label template.I used WordPerfect Office X4 to create the labels. If I seal the label with packing tape and hand wash my containers gently they stay on very well. When the label does finally get messed up with getting moist, most of it comes off with the tape and the rest comes off very easily after soaking.I imagine they work even better used as intended! If you look, you can still see what was written behind the label and I almost took a star off for that, but then I decided that it didn't really matter since the writing underneath is very faint and it doesn't detract from the utility of the product.Overall, I'm very satisfied.
