Canon paper works very effectively in my Canon printer. And 3. to get the best out of the paper, you really have to use Canon ink and the corresponding Canon printer. The HP paper takes far too long to dry and ink pools on it for a long time. I have used this paper for several years and I love it. I switched to Canon paper and ink and have never had a problem since. Love this paper, and my photos come out great. I have tried the inexpensive paper and the results reflected in the quality of the output. This paper works very well for my photo printing needs. Even though this paper is economical, most people think my everyday photos look great and I haven't hear even one complaint so far. I used pro paper before but needed something cheaper for printing on the spot. This paper outperforms any other that I've used in our two Canon printers, and I've tried many. I have always used HP photo paper on a HP printer but just recently I purchased a Canon printer so decided to use Canon photo paper. The Canon Photo paper glossy is a good example. My paper of choice has been Canon's matte photo paper (Canon Matte Photo Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches, 50 Sheets (7981A004)), because it is fairly economical, and produces good results. The matte paper does seem to absorb a lot of ink, so I decided to try Canon's glossy photo paper, which seemed to be getting rave reviews here at Amazon.The results using my year old Canon iP4600 printer, and non-Canon ink cartridges are outstanding. The paper is thicker and stiffer than I expected it to be, which is a good thing as you don't have to be super careful, to avoid bending the print. And the paper itself was thicker than the Kodak paper I had bought a few months ago.

The mat paper prints extremely nicely, this glossy paper doesn't print quite as well and it's really thin (not much thicker than standard 20# paper, but glossy).

I prefer a sturdier paper as this creases too easily when handling it (to trim photos).

I think it's worth spending a little more and getting a paper that is more like commercial processed photos.
