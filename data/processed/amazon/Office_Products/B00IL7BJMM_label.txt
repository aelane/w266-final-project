I've used several label makers over the last couple of years, and they are generally various shades of unfriendly.This label maker has been a huge improvement. With this label maker, it has become even more useful. It doesn't seem to have as much label waste on either side of what's printed as my older label makers.This has been a huge upgrade for my reloading station, it's really a fantastic device. The label printout is very sharp and clear. I do like the label designed templates and symbols that are so easy to add to my labels for emphasis. Then turn on the Bluetooth, select the Epson label printer and connect. This is the label maker you always wanted but just could not imagine so you never considered it. Epson has several cool label styles and they are all amazing: Glow in the dark, iron-on, and multiple colors for any situation. This isn't my first label printer. However the Epson LabelWorks LW-600P is, by far, the most versatile label printer that we've ever seen.o It runs off of batteries (common AA alkaline batteries--thank you Epson!) Some from Brother some from Dymo, this is my first Epson label maker. The label cartridges just snap into place and the labels are split on the back lengthwise for easy peeling. I placed a label on my bathroom vanity where I keep extra toilet paper. With my older label maker, I was basically making LABELS THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS and that was all. I have my label maker situated near my crafts "corner," and no matter where I am, I can create a label. I can also connect the label maker to my laptop via USB cable and use the app and driver from Epson to create labels.So many possibilities -- a huge library of "pre-designed" labels for common applications, plus the ability to create totally custom labels on the fly. This is a very useful label printer. My first label became a scrunched up wad of ribbon that I had to carefully extract. In the past, I have had the little label makers that have the small, awkward keyboards. You can setup a specific label for merchandise without breaking a sweat, and if price changes, print out a new bar code.If they drop the price of cartridges then I woudl give the system 5 stars. If you wanted two of the same label, you&#8217;d have to do the process twice. The Epson label maker is an incalculably huge step forward. This portable label maker from Epson is the most flexible I've ever seen. This label printer is pretty awesome. Epson LabelWorks LW-600P Portable Label Printer with Bonus 24mm Tapes is a powerful label maker that performs a host of tasks. Having used other label makers I find that the Epson LabelWorks LW-600P Portable Label Printer is capable of performing more functions more easily than units that have fewer options. If you need a label maker this is the one to get.

This is the most amazing label maker I ever owned.

Once you have a label maker, every open spot seems a good place for labeling, and not just in ISO 9001 compliant workplaces.I tested with both the iOS app (Epson iLabel) and on the Mac (Epson Label Editor Lite).
