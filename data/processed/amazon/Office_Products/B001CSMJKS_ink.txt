This is really good ink. I have been using these ink cartridges for several years now and I have never experienced any problems with them.. I only use the original ink now and haven't been disappointed. Canon ink is much better than the cheapo brands. I've only bought Canon ink for my latest printer and I've never had a problem in the three years that I've owned it. These little ink cartridges keep it fed with authentic Canon Ink. I've ordered this ink before. I like the ink, makes great photographs with lasting color. I have used this ink for years. These ink cartridges work perfectly in my Canon printer. Their ink supply is better than any off brand I have bought in the past and while I would like to get a better price for it the pennies in cost differences are inconsequential when I get an output that is superior to the others.I just wish Canon made a package that held the full compliment of inks that are required by the printer model instead of having to buy a 4 pack as this one and then another big black dispenser for the model 860. The ink produces good color on paper and there are no smudges so far. Still, the ink quality of these cartridges is superb. Any ink related issues to both machines were quickly fixed by using the nozzle cleaning and other alignment and print quality features of these machines.I would never recommend anything but Genuine Canon Ink. The correct ink cartridges for this printer.Problem is I purchased my Canon printer in Germany and for some reason the ink cartridges are not recognized from printer.now I am stuck with these cartridges which I can't use and a perfectly good printer for which I have no compatible ink cartridges.I have used Canon products for a number of years and never had a problem until this one.. The original ink works well and there are no complaints. I only wish the ink was as inexpensive as the printer! I've tried some of those re-fillable ink cartridges, but they are just not as good as the Name Brand cartridges are, so I always buy Name Brand and never use the re-filled cartridges. The Canon CLI-220 Yellow ink tank works well in my printer. Having tried some of the non-Canon ink packs, I have to say that the ink Canon provides is a better ink if you want to keep your photos for a while. This really is an expensive ink system. They are the ink tanks that go in the printer I have, i have noother choice, therefore they gotta be great

So far it looks like the ink is lasting a bit longer than I thought it might based on other reviews of the MP980 printer and these ink tanks.

These come with an LED that blinks and indicates how much ink is left, which blinks faster with less ink.

I've been using the Canon "ChromaLife100" ink tanks in a Canon iP4700 inkjet printer for the last three years, and they've been 100% reliable.
