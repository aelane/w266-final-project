A comfortable and well built chair for the money, I expect to get years of enjoyment out of it. Overall, this chair feels like the quality is above average for chairs of this type and especially in this price range. Once assembled, the chair looks nice and is comfortable, but this is not your lean back and relax type of "Executive" chair, this is more of a working, task chair. Nowhere on the chair, carton, or the instructions does it state that the covering is leather.This chair is priced right, is comfortable and it looks good. It's a really comfortable chair and the arms are great as they are soft and a joy to rest your arms on. They had the chair completely assembled in less than 20 minutes, with only a couple of parts left over (oops).One of my pet peeves is a cheap rock/lock lever. This high back chair comes with heavy padding materials on both the back and seat which makes it very comfortable to sit on. (Please see photos) This is a VERY nice chair, and nicely designed and put together. Everywhere you'd touch when you sit in the chair is leather, the rest is a heavy-duty plastic which blends nicely with the leather. An armless rocking-type chair is a lovely gift for newlyweds. This is a very basic chair, best suited for a home office that's used for 30-60 minutes per day. Don't buy this chair and plan to sit in it 8 hours a day - you'll be sorely disappointed. When assembled, the chair has a solid feel, doesn't squeak, and doesn't tilt from  side to side. Although the chair is listed as "High Back", it's more comparable to a mid-sized chair. So assemble the chair outside or in your garage, and wipe it down before moving it into your home or office.Overall, this chair provides fair comfort and reasonable back support for short term use. Once you actually manage to get the chair assembled, you'll have a high quality chair that is suitable for comfortable sit with a favorite drink by your side or just spinning around in circles until you make yourself dizzy. The chair feels like it would go perfectly in a home office type setting, though it could be used as a stand-alone piece of furniture. It's a very large chair, so I doubt size is a real worry with this chair.Assembly can be quite complicated, and may be a two person job because of the various screws and bolts that needed to be placed before the chair is fully operational. Hopefully it IS real leather, because if so this chair will get better with time and hold up better than synthetic leather (pleather). I am very happy with this chair. The chair is very comfortable. The chair looks great and is very soft and comfortable. This chair is adjustable for great comfort. I am very pleased with this chair. I have to say that this chair is comfortable. I like that this chair has the height adjustment as well since I am tall.The arms are very comfortable and since I like to move from my file cabinet to the desk, this is easy to move on the wheels. This chair has easy clean up just wipe and go. The chair is roomy and comfortable. Overall  great chair. )The chair itself is very nicely designed. Something that has ruined/scratched/ripped every other chair I own. This HON chair was very easy to assemble. The chair is made of the softest, supple leather. The chair's height adjusts up and down through a pneumatic lift. Pull it to allow the chair to tilt. Push it to lock the chair upright.The tilt tension can be adjusted via a large knob underneath the seat. The chair feels big, like an executive chair would. Otherwise, it's a very nice chair. This is a really nice, very professional looking chair. Now when I sit in the chair it feels like I'm sitting on a board with a towel over it. Not so - this chair was a breeze to put together and the spare parts were definitely a bonus.The chair itself is very comfortable, especially the padded arms, and provides adequate back support. All in all, a great chair for a fair price. This chair fits nicely into a smaller room, yet it is mid sized.

This "executive high-backed chair" may make you feel like the boss, but you'll probably need your secretary to help you put it together.The "pleather" surface is very nice, it rolls well on a hard surface, it's comfortable, it looks good, and it has held up well so far.

This chair is fairly easy to assemble.In particular, they mark front and left and such on the appropriate parts, which saves a lot of hassle.

I can sit in this chair all day comfortably.
