This shredder from Dirt Devil is an amazing investment. It's important to have a shredder in both work and home environments and this will work great in either. This is a very large shredder, thus you must have adequate space for it to stand.The shredder will not fit under my desk thus it has to stand alone at the end. The shredder looks good at the end of the desk. The shredder has blue lights on top and once the shredding starts the inside of the waste basket has a blue light. This is a "reconditioned" shredder and I have no idea what was wrong with to to cause it to have to be reconditioned. This shredder Does not have that issue at all. This really is a perfect shredder for a home or small office.There Is one thing you need to note before buying this, with a price tag of the time of this review at just under $130 it is an expensive shredder. I can't say enough about this shredder! I replace the shredder in my home-office about every two years. At over 25" high, this is not an "under-the-desk" shredder. This shredder does a great job at shredding the documents. First this shredder gets the coolness factor rating of 5 stars! This is the most powerful shredder I have owned. I needed a good shredder and badly. If you're looking for a great shredder, this is the one to go with! Having not used it long enough, I do not know how sturdy and durable this Dirt Devil shredder is going to be. I'm just passing this on to save you some of the shredder frustration I've experienced.I am cautiously optimistic that I've got a shredder that is more likely to last than most home or small office shredders. I love, love, love this shredder! The shredder stands 26" tall, 16" wide and 11.5" deep. You can't ever really call a shredder quiet, but this one is noticeably quieter than my previous, over-the-trash-bin shredder.The thing I really love about this shredder is the generous, 7 gallon, pull-out bin. Great little shredder, perfect for small office or home based business. All in all a great little shredder and a nice price point. I was mainly interested in this shredder because of the size of its basket.
