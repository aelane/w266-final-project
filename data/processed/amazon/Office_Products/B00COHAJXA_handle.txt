I'm not sure how long the handle would hold up against the weight of the potential things you can fit into this binder either.That said, I like how there are so many compartments and that there is multi-use flexibility. There is a handle along the spine to make carrying the binder (once zippered) easier.Cons: To get a pen or pencil you have to unzipper the binder and the inner pocket. There's a carrying handle on the spine. It even has a handle on the spine so it may be carried easily.Why only four stars? The handle is very handy and the zipper feels secure. The handle is useful and the file area is well organized as well. The handle is nice, but in reality it'd need to be on the top to be useful for getting it out of the backpack. At least it has a handle so you can carry it like a briefcase. There is a carrying handle,but the addition of a strap would be an improvement, especially at this price point. The handle is slightly too tight on this binder but I guess it stretches a little under the weight and you don't want a loose handle hanging out. If you use the handle to carry the binder (zippered), anything that is in that section, just slips out into the zippered area. The handle makes this easy to carry around even when their backpack is left in their locker, or in the classroom. There's a handle on the top and the binder is contained in a pouch of its own and there's a separate pouch with an accordion file. It appears to be at least as sturdy as what we've had before and it has a handle on the edge so he can just tote it to class without his backpack if needed. There's also a handle on the back, so that you can carry it like a briefcase once full.

The handle is not particularly useful, but who knows I might find that I can't live without it someday (at least once I fill it up to its rated 800+ sheet capacity.

It also has a handle so it's ridiculously convenient to grab and carry.I'm considering buying a second one to hold our important household papers, bills, and all that paperwork that seems to accumulate because I can zip it all together and in the case of an emergency or fire, just grab that one thing and go.

I love the comfortable handle, zippered pocket great for pens and markers, velcroed pocket perfect size for smartphone or calculator.
