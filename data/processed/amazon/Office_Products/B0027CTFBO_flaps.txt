This may seem silly to some, but these numbered flaps actually make the process that much easier and I think it was a smart idea on the part of Fellowes to include this. "Wait, what about the flaps?" There are flaps on both sides that you wrap and lock into handle openings, and it makes for very nice handles, they do not cut your hands when you lift the box. The self-locking flaps mean that they don't need tape. The top flaps fold down with a tab in the grasp holes.These are easy to tape shut if you need to ship personal items or documents via small parcel carrier such as Federal Express or UPS. The flaps double as protection for you hands since it folds over the rough, punched out cardboard edge.Overall, I'm really impressed with the design of the boxes and found them to be very study and reliable in my move. The flaps that hold the lid down, while secure, seem like they would tear or weaken after repeated uses. Just unfold, detach two flaps (easily done by hand), and fold the various flaps into place. The flaps are all numbered and the box fit together well and gave the impression of sturdiness. And, what's new is that the top flaps fold inside the box so unless the box is being used for actual shipment through the post office or UPS, no tape is necessary to secure the top of the box. One of the flaps has flaps on both sides that securely fold into the hand holds on the side of the box.There are absolutely no inter-locking pieces to wrestle with. He, at first, didn't recognize that the top flaps became the lid, but once he did, he put it together quite nicely.It does seem strange to order boxes from Amazon, since they keep me so well stocked. There are two small perforated flaps that I separated with my hands so you don't need any other tools. The flaps are on the top part of a larger flap and fold into to the handholds on the box. Unlike the Banker Box, there are not additional flaps to provide a third bottom layer or a second side layer. I'm not sure how well these flaps will hold up after being used a few times, the box may eventually need to be sealed with packaging tape. They are super easy to assemble and I like how the top flaps fold into the hand holds to make a smooth surface for carrying (which is also very nice when you have a heavy box so it doesn't cut into your hands).
