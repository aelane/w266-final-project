A nice little untreated cloth to clean my Taylor guitar.Now if I could only play the guitar as well as this cloth cleans it. It's a good cloth for polishing, no more to say about it. This cloth works well in cleaning off the dust, fingerprints, oil, and dirt off of my guitar. Great cloth for keeping those pesky fingerprints and other smudges off your valuable guitars. You place the cloth next to a string, then hook your little finger under and pull up so the cloth surrounds the lower surfaces, sides and top of the string, then pressing it in around the string slide up and down the full length a couple of times, then repeat on the remaining strings. Compared to Ernie Ball's cloth, it's good enough for wiping down things. Overall good cloth for general use. This cloth is fantastic for wiping down your strings after use. This is just a simple microfiber cloth that works just like it should. This polish cloth is cheap and does the job of wiping your guitar down from dust or from use with cleaning products. I'm pretty happy with this cloth. Well it's a cloth and I use it to wipe my guitar.

Sorry, but I'm not as smitten with this cloth as some of the other reviewers.

You can also washthis untreated polish cloth in mild soap and water, rinse it out and hang it up to dry.

This cloth cleans up pretty well, but what i noticed after wiping down the strings a few times is that the fibers would hook.
