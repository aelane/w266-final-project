What can I say....for the price, this is the best tuner out there right now! The price is darn good as well. The Snark is less than half the price of my GoGo and out performs it...it's a no brainer. It works fine and I would recommend them at this good price. For $10 - which is also half the price at your local guitar shops. wonderful price and great product. Quite amazing, especially for the price. Highly recommended for the price. Snark has a GOOD TUNER for low price. For the price, this is a great deal! Easy to read and for the very low price a great value. Can't beat the price, and battery compartment is easy to open, unlike some other tuners I have. I wasn't expecting much as the price was very reasonable for a good tuner.
