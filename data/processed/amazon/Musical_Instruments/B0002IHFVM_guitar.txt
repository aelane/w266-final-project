I only recently started playing the guitar, and as a beginner, I wanted to get a less expensive strap to go with my less expensive guitar.This one came at a great price and it's sturdy enough for me, so I think this is very decent strap for the price I paid for it. Bought this with my first guitar just to have anything to hang it from. I have this on a green guitar with a green pickguard and black hardware. This is a very very nice guitar strap. I have a classical guitar and sadly, this strap does not fit it. It holds your guitar on your body so you can play it. The guitar could take that head dive of death, while one dive might not do too much damage a few might crack the neck or worse.My Advice: unless you plan to sit and play (which you wont really need a strap anyways) the whole time, spend alittle more to get a leather strap. Works well for my guitar.

They are useless to me, as my guitar, a dreadnought, covers the middle of my chest when I put it on.

They are bulky when putting the guitar in a case, but I just leave them on.

It's a must for any rambunctious guitar player.
