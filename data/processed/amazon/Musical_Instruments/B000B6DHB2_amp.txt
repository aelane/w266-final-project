This little amp kicks major ass, dood. Never dreamed of such an enjoyable little amp, let alone for $20. This little amp is exactly what my son needed for his acoustic guitar's output while playing outside on the porch. The amp produces a much "bigger" sound with much better quality than expected. this is the perfect amp for bed practice! Its surprisingly loud for a small amp. I wanted a portable small sized amp for using my electric guitar outdoors -- but was not really in a position to pay the big dollars for one of the high end brands. I bought this amp as a back up for my 9 year old son and to take to the park... This is a nice little amp, it sounds prety good for the price. Don't get me wrong...this is a great little amp for practicing...but it eats batteries like they were candy. In general, this amp is pretty forgiving of the input. Interestingly I have found this amp seems to work significantly better with acoustic-electrics or piezo-based pickups better than magnetic pickups.

Paired with the Zero Hum AC Adaptor, it's a highly portable amp setup.

As you might expect, it's a pretty boxy sounding little amp, more reminiscent of 60's portable transistor radios than a double stack Marshall.

I didn't expect too much on $20 amp, but surprisingly, it positively gives me more than I ask for.
