This is my 6th Joyo pedal and like the others, it does not dissapoint. Like many have mentioned, this pedal is like a TS but without the mid-hump. This pedal is really about getting touch sensitive low gain responsiveness and texture. When you play lightly, it gets cleaner- which is why it is so similar to the $200 Sweet Honey pedal (the controls are also identical but I haven't compared the internals). This pedal has become an essential, 'always on' pedal for me ! This is my favorite pedal...and I have a ton. The pedal is very transparent, smooth and touch sensitive and cleans up well.You can't get a bad sound because there is not a lot of knobs to mess with.This pedal basically takes the sound of your amp, adds a little gain with very little compression and gives you picking control. Surprisingly, this pedal with the gain on 10 and the tone on 10, gives me a great metal tone all by itself! If i boost the pedal with say a few db of clean boost, it gets me exactly where I'd want to be (a dry, tight metal tone, kinda 5150ish.

I put this pedal in front of my OCD and I was really getting some sweet tones.

I've owned more than one overdrive pedal in my 30 years of playing guitar and the only one I still have on my pedal board is the Boss Super Overdrive...Sweet Baby is well on the way of living up to that legend as well.

As far as the pedal goes it is pretty much the same as a lot of them...instead of a tone knob they call it "focus", there is also a volume and drive knob.
