It's a cable. Nice one, small, soft, cheap cable with comfortable lenght. I snagged this cable so I had the one right angle for my pedal board and the other end for my guitar. It has what you want in a cable, and not what you don't. I purchased the Planet Waves 10 Ft Instrument cable for our son to hook up his electric guitar to his amplifier. This cable is dirt cheap, but the quality seems to be just fine. The cable material is very bendable and easy to work with. I prefer cable ends that are formed (not the type which can be unscrewed), as there is less risk of breakage and noise. cable is conducive of good tone but jacks wear out after about one year of use. I had a cable with the standard Neutrik/Switchcraft-type ends fail on me, and this cable was supposed to be either strain free or simply designed for long life because of the strain of usage.It worked great for about 4-6 months, and then broke. When I have to replace this cable I will likely buy this same cable or something else by PW because of all the cables I have owned PW seems to withstand my abuse most effectively. This cable is really good for the price! Both the every expensive Monster cable and this one share some high end components and construction.I love the strain relief on this cable more than the one on the Monster. Good  cable works for me, using it in a rhythmtrak foot switch. Clear amazing cable VERY UNDERRATED incredibly cheap and amazing sound quality overall But where this cable does impress is how easy it is to handle. What can one say about a cable?They are intended to transmit electrical impulse with the least amount in interference and this one does a superb job of just that.Why I have been thinking of replacing all of my other cables with additional cables just like this one, only slightly longer or a good deal shorter depending on the intended function. A good cable for the money. Well this cable certainly didn't last long as the title says 8 weeks. The cable died on me in less than a month. seems like a well made cable and i like planet waves products in general

I prefer this cable over a lot of more expensive cables because it's inexpensive, yet lightweight, flexible, and of more than acceptable quality.

I haven't used the cable yet, but it looks new and durable.

The cable appears to be structurally sound around end connections and seems to be what I expected.
