Wonderful tuner, I've used it for my acoustic and my bass and have had no problems at all. This tuner is s[pot on every time and super fast. "I keep a tuner on each guitar and one in my gig bag, just in case. Just thought I'd try the SN-8 Super tight tuner and was not at all disappointed. However, once I opened it, I discovered an undamaged Snark tuner inside. I just got my Snark tuner, and I'm very impressed with it. They are the first tuner my young guitar students have no problems with. I love this tuner.

Lightweight, small, simple to use, and it's easy to read in broad daylight.Can't ask for much more in a tuner.
