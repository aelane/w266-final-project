I ordered this pedal through Amazon and had it for a few days but ultimately sent it back because it was redundant in my arsenal. I've had this pedal for about five years. This pedal will work best with a tube amp but some people may dig the gain tone on a solid state.It's built like a tank. This is purely an overdrive pedal, not a distortion pedal. You've got to get this pedal. I love this pedal. This pedal makes my Les Paul sing. I think that this pedal is a good value as an overdrive pedal but its speaker simulated 2nd output makes it a great value as a stand alone guitar preamp!I plugged it into my DAW and listened on my KRKs and was impressed by its sound. But since the pedal works well as a level/gain boost, I've heard of guitarists turning on the Bad Monkey in conjunction with other distortion effects, to really push them to new levels.But the best feature of the Bad Monkey by far is the two-band EQ. This pedal is beyond loud. If I lost my pedal, I would order another right away. I am also using this pedal with my Ibanez GB 10 arch top jazz guitar and I am amazed with how good of an over drive I can get!! I've tried to like this pedal, I really have. And the blue pedal isn't any different, either IMO.

This pedal is Tubescreamer-esque, but not as midrange-heavy as a TS.

The BAD MONKEY overdrive pedal does not produce "Crazy Train" metal distortion.

The pedal does not come with, but does accept, an external power supply (i.e., an adapter).
