At first, I wasn't sure what to expect from these D'Addario "Balanced Tension" strings. The D'Addario Balanced Tension strings are a good value, and worth slightly higher price. These are excellent strings, the type that a gigging musician would likely use on their guitar. The strings are slightly easier to bend and feel just a little bit better. The EXL110BT strings are about $5.00 a set. The new D'Addario coated strings are fine, but they end up being about the same price as Elixir. I'll stick with what I know well.My 1981 Lucille did love these strings. All the strings are in a single plastic package, I prefer individual paper envelopes. They loop two strings together and I hate that. Sometimes the strings get crossed over when unlooping them and it makes me mess with the strings for a while. I've used D'Addario strings for a long time (been playing 20+yrs) and have always been satisfied with their tone. I've tried various coated strings etc but always come back to Ernie for sound and value. I still had the original strings on an Epiphone LP-100 guitar I bought last November. I know that's bad, but buying strings can be complicated (and overwhelming). Nice strings. I would recommend you try these strings on your guitar because they work for me. These strings are OK...I've always been partial to Nickel wound (particularly semi-flatwound, but I digress). My typical strings are Elixirs, so I'm used to them lasting a long time. So, like most D'Addario strings. The strings had a good feel to them as well.Where I noticed the Balanced Tension the most was when I played chords. Impressive.I think I have some new favorite strings for my Strat!

Strung these up on my LP Goldtop with P-90's.D'Addario promises these strings to be "comprised of mathematically optimized string gauge combinations" that result in "greater dynamic control and a more consistent feel between strings.

Well, if you like really light strings that bend easily, you're not going to like these.

D'Addario strings are like the Kias of the string world.
