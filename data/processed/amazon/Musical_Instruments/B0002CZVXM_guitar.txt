I can switch out many different guitar straps without worrying that they will fall off. Incredible guitar after tweaking. I did a guitar spin at a show and the guitar went flying. After that, I installed this into my new guitar and strap and, I was ready to go. I always purchase Grovers for my guitar straps but my 2014 Gibson Les Paul Standard Plus had a bigger strap knob so I bought this Dunlop and it fit the guitar perfectly. A good guitar is a big investment and you owe it to yourself to protect your investment with a good strap locking system. My guitar player had a different lock system, and his $1000 Les Paul fell to the stage, completely knocking it out of tune. These are really great guitar locks!! I play guitar and keyboard and, sometimes, I need to quickly put guitar on my back to play keyboards.

I figured since the guitar came with them I would try them out.

They stick out too far and on any guitar with a strap button on the back it jabs you in the stomach or below!2- Problems engaging.

I have these on my Jazz Bass, my guitar player has another brand.
