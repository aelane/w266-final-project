This capo was just perfect for my needs. I recommend this capo without reservation. This is a fantastic little capo. I love this capo better than any I have seen or used. You wont go wrong with this capo. Love this capo on my electric guitar. Great capo. This is an awesome capo! I use the NS capo on my Gibson SG Special faded and it does exactly what it is supposed to do. This allows you to finely tune the capo to add just enough pressure to bar the fret but not damage the stings.It works on steel strings.

It's the least obtrusive and best capo ever.

This inexpensive capo works as advertised.

Purchased this capo after having a bad experience with a spring style capo.
