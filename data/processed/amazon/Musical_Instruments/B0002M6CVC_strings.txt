very nice strings. I like Ernie Ball strings. I change strings every two weeks. lovely strings  for rhythm guitarist, special i'm using it for reggae skanks rhythm and it sounds warm and scream... thanks So far I am very happy with these strings. I've been using these strings for many years. This are some great strings. As cheap as these strings were, I am pleasantly surprised with the results achieved.I picked up an old, cheap electric guitar that needed some work. Great strings can make a bad guitar okay, not great.I will continue buying and using these on my lower end guitars but will spend the few extra bucks on my high end guitars. I have been using these strings for a while now. These strings are good, especially for the price. I have found better strings through D'Addario however, and the feel of them is  superior to these in my opinion. I have never been let down by Ernie Ball strings. these strings are great if you need practice changing your strings. these strings last 2 days and then they are dull and lifeless and need to be changed, the high e and the b string tend to break before they even get tuned to pitch, Ernie Ball strings are garbage, the only time I will buy these is if it's the only thing available, most people like these because they are endorsed by so many musicians that are paid to say that they like this garbage, and even if they do like them they are not your average players that need more than 2 days out of a set of strings, Touring musicians have the guitar tech change the strings after they play their set, and they get an unlimited amount of these crap strings so their guitars always sound fresh,  you can spend 4$ for a set of Ernie Ball or D'Addario every 2 days or you can spend $7 for a set of DR strings and change them once a month, or you can spend 10$ for a set of Elixir Polywebs and change your strings once every 3 months,  It doesn't make sense to use these crappy Ernie's unless you are sponsored by EB and have an endless supply and a tech to change them for you like the rockstars, the best strings in the world i recently switched to ernie cobalt strings which are more expensive but so much epic! I tried switching to some other strings for a few years such as the GHS boomers and D'Addario. Great strings. I've tried several different strings on electric, and Ernie Ball Slinkys are the only ones I really trust on all of my guitars. Overall I would say that they feel about the same as my D'Addario strings, but if the price is right I wouldn't mind a substitution every now and again. Very good strings These strings are Great! These have always been my favorite strings, and I've just about tried them all. My favorite strings for about 3 years now, i like the feel and the sound of this set. I use this strings with an Ibanez RG Custom with Dimarzios. Im sure these strings are fine, I like the cobalt ones a lot they sound good on my Jackson Rose.

These are my favorite strings for electric guitar.

I've tried other strings, like Gibson and D'Addario, but I like the sound and feel of Ernie Balls the best -- they feel nice, full, thick, hefty.

Ernie Balls are nice strings, cheap, durable and produce a rich sound.
