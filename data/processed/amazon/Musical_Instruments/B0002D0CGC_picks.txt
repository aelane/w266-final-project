I have been using Dunlop picks for a long time. I prefer nylon picks because they have a softer feel on the strings to my ear - less "clicky" - than a standard plastic pick. Hard to go wrong with these if you like nylon picks. I bought these because I wanted durable, flexible picks for easy strumming. I like thin picks myself, and this one is VERY thin. I would give these picks five stars, but I do have a couple of other types I prefer more. Still, these are nice picks. The picks aren't cleanly cut out they are injection molded and as a result they are left with a thin trim all around them.I'll stick with Dunlop Gator Grip .96mm or PRS 1.0 picks. These have been my favorite picks, for decades now. OK, so picks are a very personal thing to guitarists. These picks are nylon, so each one will last you a couple of years (as long as you don't lose them!!)

Dunlop's Nylon picks don't break, and once you find the thickness that fits your needs, you'll find that they have excellent string attack and are easily kept in grip.

I rarely ever drop one of these picks while preforming.

Buy these picks.
