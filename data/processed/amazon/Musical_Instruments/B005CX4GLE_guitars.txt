My three guitars and mandolin take up virtually no room in my small house anymore, my guitars are decorating the wall at the same time, and my guitars won't tip over either. We have guitars, basses, ukeleles and mandolins hanging from them - they work on all sizes. While I wouldn't trust these to hold up my electric guitars, I have found other uses for them and have 2 of them now. I have five guitars, including two Les Paul's and they hold them just fine. The are fine for, I believe, all guitars at home, but I wouldn't use them for retail or something like a school. Wanted to hang my guitars on the wall. The guitars are less likely to bang on the wall. I keep all my guitars in my room and I had to many stands cluttering it up.

What makes it fit all guitars is that the prongs rotate independently.

I have a few guitars and these hooks work extremely well without costing too much.I also like the clean almost modern lines and that they don'y look like hardware.Plus they are all padded afor protection.
