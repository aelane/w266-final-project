I had to go back to that when my first Planet Waves black THERMOPLASTIC capo broke. This capo fits so easily. A capo should always be flat and out of your way so you can play chords, not pretzeled twister instead of chords. I bought every capo imaginable (need to have a garage sale to get rid of the pile) but ended up that I was using the old toggle type again instead until I found the aluminum Silver Planet Waves Capo. Planet Waves has made the perfect capo now, no more issues, just easy fun playing capo'd songs. This is a very fast and easy capo to use, the tension adjustment is fast and easy. If you need an all around capo for a six string guitar, this is it. The capo design makes for a quick and easy install on the fretboard.

I love this capo.

Let me tell you about my capo journey where I've used every brand while searching for this one.

First, I always owned the old Dunlop Toggle Action capo which is just old tech, you know, where it's just a bundle of synthetic cotton fiber, the kind one used to use before 1980.
