The cutter worked great, too. I realy like the cutter. Well the cutter part of the tool is a little hard to open - guess I'm used to side cutters or pliers - and it doesn't cut strings really close to the tuning pin - it leaves about a half inch of string hanging. The cutter even works well. The cutter part is nice, it is solid and effective without being too heavy, yet it does feel well made. The cutter snips the strings with no effort. The cutter was a real plus so I didn't have to track down my diagonal cutters. The cutter works perfectly. The cutter makes this thing really worth while.

The cutter is so that I pinched my finger during use.
