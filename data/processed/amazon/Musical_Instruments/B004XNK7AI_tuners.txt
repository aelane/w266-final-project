I tested it against some of my more sensitive tuners and found it to be spot on. Snark tuners are great. Since I've bought Snark tuners, they have never broken or fell out of tuning capability in any way. Snark tuners are the most comfortable ones you can find. I LOVE snark tuners, this not being the first one I bought, nor the last. I own many tuners, and clip ons of many other brands. Also, unlike other tuners I've used, this tuner does a great job of filtering/ignoring ambient noise in the room. Even after eliminating tuners by D'Addario and Planet Waves, selecting the SN5 wasn't that simple, as Snark makes a number of similar tuners. It is also the least expensive, of the tuners I was considering buying.

I tested this not only by ear but against other tuners ... very disappointing ...

I have used the old Planet Waves tuners for years and had settled on them as the best choice for the price; however, since D'Addario now owns Planet Waves products, they have discontinued the tuner I like and only offer the NS Mini Tuner (it has its place I guess, but I much prefer the larger one ... too bad they made this decision IMO) ...I haven't settled on my new tuner of choice yet so for now I will keep using my old Planet Waves models ...Bottom line, no matter how nice the Snark is in many ways, the primary function is to help the musician tune accurately, not only string to string but to a standard A-440 ... having failed that requirement, it is useless for me, especially in a band situation ...

Snark tuners are the best.
