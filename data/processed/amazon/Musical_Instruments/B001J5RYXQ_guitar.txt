I bought this guitar nearly a year ago. It was my first guitar. I eventually bought an acoustic guitar to learn to play and have been happier with it than this Squier. It's actually fairly light for an electric guitar and I went with it because it's by Fender and it does seem to have that Fender quality for the price. It's not a high-end guitar so don't expect it to sound like one, but for a beginner, it's pretty sweet. If you're just starting out, this guitar is perfect for you. This guitar just got stolen from me!!! So I proceed to setup the guitar through 3 long and painful steps: 1)Straightened the neck by adjusting the truss rod.

)This is overall an OK guitar, consider its price it can be made at least slightly better.
