I am going to replace all my old screws with these. I bought these because I am constantly loosing screws when I change pickguards or do new builds.These are exactly what the doctor ordered. OK, so they are just screws....... but a quality replacement for ones for the rusting one!!! You get more than enough screws to install a front pickguard and a tremolo on your Stratocaster, however this lacks the two longer screws near the bridge on the front pickguard. Other than the two missing screws, this hardware is a great replacement for any missing or oxidized hardware on your Stratocaster. Old screws rust, and often when presented with a new pick guard there are 11 instead of 8 holes for attachment. Also good for lost attachment screws on the back of the guitar and for tuning mechanisms. I guess they are just screws, but they seem to be good quality. Pickguard screws. The screws are not very tough and you have to be gentle with them so that the screwdriver doesn't bugger up the heads. These screws fit my project guitar perfectly and considering it was an older Epiphone by Gibson S-900 that I opted to add a pick guard too, the screws fit everything perfectly.

I'm sure the screws are the right length to fit authentic Stratocasters anyways.

These screws are not a shiny chrome, so they worked perfectly for my pearl pickguard and black Fender Strat body.

I have replaced my old tarnished screws with these.
