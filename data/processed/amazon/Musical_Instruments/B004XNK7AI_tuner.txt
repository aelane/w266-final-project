Easy and quite simple to use, this tuner is accurate and none intrusive, so you can leave it on your instrument for a quick re-tune on the go. It is a great, reliable tuner. I used this tuner as I transitioned from playing Rocksmith to playing in the real world. With this tuner, it doesn't matter if it is electric or acoustic, it gives a very very accurate reading. I bought this because I bought a used Martin D15M that didn't have a tuner built in, and it clips right on the neck and is easy to turn on. This is a great little tuner and I recommend it. The tuner I choose is very easy to use, simple and small. Great tuner for the price.Makes tunning easy and fast.The grips come off the neck on my acoustic,but works better on my electric. Great tuner just bought 8 of them for X-Mas presents. It's a great little tuner, great accuracy, but unfortunately, they are a bit on the delicate side. Got this tuner for my new bass. This tuner is super easy to use and very user friendly. I had never seen a tuner that you can just clip onto the neck like this, and it is hugely convenient to have it sitting right there as you play. Good little tuner at a steal of a price. I compared it to my Boss TU-2 tuner plugged in to the guitar and it was just as accurate and maybe a bit tighter. If I can take my tuner pedal out of the loop and off my board, I will be happy. I also have purchased several red, blue and the new Super Tight tuner. This is a very accurate tuner. The tuner picks up vibrations, so it doesn't require a silent room to tune an acoustic guitar. Fabulous tuner. I love my Snark SN5 tuner. All you need to do is clamp the tuner to the headstock, and it is ready to go. The tuner also works for bass guitars and violins. I love this tuner... I especially love being able to tune with a silent tuner. This tuner works by picking up the vibrations of my instrument.I decided to buy this tuner after another musician lent me his extra one during a jam session.

I used this tuner for my guitar and ending up passing it around all night between three bass players and four guitarists.

I was really surprised at the Snark SN-5 tuner.
