I can do a string change-over in about 15 minutes on a bad day. Buy the best all around string and improve your tone immediately. I haven't broke a string while tuning in 20 years, never ever had one break on the ball end.Luckily I bought the three pack.But I can't recommend this product. My favorite string from back in the '60s when I had my own guitar shop. I have never broke a D'Addario acoustic string. I haven't broken a string during a performance in years, and believe me, I ain't being gentle with 'em. D'addario makes a pretty good string, but I'd have to say I prefer the Elixir. I usually play classical (nylon string) guitar, but have an Ovation deep-bowl acoustic electric as well and after the original strings wore out, I never have found strings that I really liked (don't ask me why I never thought about contacting Ovation and asking them what they use from the factory.

These are the string of choice for my acoustic and have been for many many years.

The string that's best for bluegrass with a hard attack may not be what's best for delicate finger style.Bottom line: Don't follow leaders.

This is my favorite string to use on all my acoustic instruments.
