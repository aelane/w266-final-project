This tuner works great. this tuner is awesome and accurate, very noticeable and what else can i say, for the price, best deal ever. The best tuner for your board in my opinion! I bought this tuner over the TC Electronic poly tune and I am very happy with my purchase. I truly recommend it as a tuner pedal. IMO you can't go wrong with this tuner, very pleased. The perfect tuner. If you need a smaller tuner, I have buddies who use and like the polytune. The tuner displays the note you are closest to, and the colors guide you to the perfect pitch, marked by the green light in the middle (almost like an airplane landing guide). The tuner works quickly and reliably.The build quality is outstanding, and it's true bypass. Awesome tuner, really fast and responsive. This tuner did just fine with the low B on a 5 string bass.

This is pretty much the ideal tuner, as far as I'm concerned.

If you've been using a cheap crappy tuner like I was, you'll notice the difference all the more.If you want a hyper-accurate tuner for some kind of technical work, the Pitchblack's tolerances might not be quite what you're looking for.

I wanted a tuner pedal that I could use under any lighting condition.
