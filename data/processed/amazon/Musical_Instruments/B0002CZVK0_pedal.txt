I got this pedal cause is not so expensive, and I love music. This pedal covers the &#34;White Room&#34; by Cream Tone perfectly. Great pedal and it is still built like a tank. A great pedal, well made! It is a good pedal, but it just doesn't have the sound I was looking for. I've had my wah pedal for a number of years now. If you are like me though and place it in a pedal board where a unified power source makes sense and must use a different power cable, at least on my unit, the jack is not fitting properly leading to some serious shorts. It is a very well made pedal that is a must have, if you play any classic rock. I'd rather have one pedal that does its job perfectly than a pedal that does a bunch of stuff but sounds less than great.

You can't really do that with this pedal.

Great pedal, but if you pull it open and put in a couple of cheap mods, this thing is absolutley rediculous!

It's still an ok pedal but I wanted the ability to leave the pedal "open" to achieve a certain warm sound.
