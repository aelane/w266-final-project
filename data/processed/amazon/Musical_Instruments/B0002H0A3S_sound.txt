The sound is almost identical to what D'Addario describes, these strings have a great, uplifting sound to them, hard to soft strums. I personally like the sound better than the Martin ESs I have tried but that is a personal choice. Always a great sound at a great price. String sound is a personal thing. Good sound, long lasting. I like the sound they provide and the price is nice. I found that my Washburns sound better with this brand at least as far as my own ears are concerned. I like their full sound and their lasting tones. Yet, they completely  changed the sound of my guitar and it sounds like I forked over some money for a decent guitar! Good sound and the feel is good. They have a brassy sound to them. The sound and tone are great, and the price is right. I'm glad I chose them, as they play easily and have a nice sound. The sound is a little brighter, and the strings last longer with Elixir. The sound is excellent, the playability comfy.

Some sound best with 80/20s.

The were easy to put on and have held up well other than tarnishing quickly.But the sound is the problem.

The sound is clear and warm on my Yamaha and my Martin.
