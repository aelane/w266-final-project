This guitar tuner is simply AMAZING!!! Even on an unplugged electric guitar, just clamp it on the end of the guitar, and it picks up vibration for tuning easily, and tunes spot-on. I still have to touch up my guitar when finished with this tuner. I would try one at a guitar shop before purchasing. I use it on a guitar, a bass and a 12 string and it works well on all of them. It's very light and can adjust very easily on both electric and acoustic guitar. An experienced guitar teacher recommended this one to me. Small enough to keep along with your guitar to make sure it is in tune each time you play a little. It clips onto the guitar easily, stays put, and is not intrusive by weight or size. Remember its a guitar tuner, not an impact wrench.

After tuning, I turn it off and put it back in the guitar case.

I don't like it hanging in my guitar!

Sure, if you put it on a guitar and leave it there at home, it will likely last at least a year and maybe longer requiring a battery change one day if you are lucky.
