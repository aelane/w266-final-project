I'm not one to use picks much so when I do I prefer a light pick. I think picks are like, well you know, a personal choice, I bought these cause they are simple, inexpensive and will compare to others I have. What else can be said about them, they're good picks. These are good picks and produce a great tone. They're better than most picks at sticking to my sweaty fingers. this picks are great for hard rock since they are heavey but not that heavy for solos. The picks are very comfortable and seem that they will last well. 100 picks for 20 dolares? I'm really happy with my new picks! These picks have served me very well. These picks were a good deal. They're my favorite picks and I always buy the medium ones! I'm sure other picks works just fine, but these are always my preference. These picks were a filler item for a much larger order. The picks feel great and I'm having a good time. These "assorted" picks are really all the same, just different colors. They always give me good picks to use.
