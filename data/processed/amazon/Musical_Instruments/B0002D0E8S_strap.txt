Awesome strap. Perfectly happy with this strap. I needed a new strap but I didn't want to pay $20 for one. The strap is awesome. It's very very comfortable and can expand longer than any strap I've ever had. A very good strap. I was displeased with a somewhat poor-quality strap I was using before. This is just what it looks like - a very economical strap. This strap is very long, if you need it to be. Great inexpensive strap. A very attractive and well constructed strap. this is a great strap. I wouldn't trust this strap without a strap lock. The strap is sturdy. They are longer than your standerd strap and that is great for a big guy like myself. This is a great strap for the money. The strap material and the double-leather ends are heavy duty and should last a long time. Just like every other strap of its kind. Finally I found a long strap for my new guitar. This new strap is plenty long enough, and looks good. But figured if it wasn't up to being a reliable strap for my expensive & pretty heavy ax that I could always use it for my Rock Band guitar. And I'm rather certain that this strap will outlast the Rock Band guitar. So very pleased with this strap & would recommend it for any beginner with a inexpensive guitar that's likely 1/4 plastic and very lightweight. I've used this strap on different guitars and it works great on all of them. If you're looking for an economical strap this will work great. My preferred strap was a hand made leather with my name on it, but it wasn't adjustable. I even prefer this to a nice Levy's strap that I own because the Ernie Ball strap is a bit slipperier Great strap, durable and good lookin. This is my second Ernie Ball strap i have gotten, and sure there are cheaper straps out there its a crapshoot what your going to get from them.

This strap kicks butt im a tall and big guy so its hard to find longer straps for cheap and baby is long if I have it to max its TO LONG that never happened to me and im 6 4 300 LBS so if your tall buy it don't waste your time with the Planet Wave ones there junk too short and the leather ends are really thin and brake after a few weeks of hard usage
