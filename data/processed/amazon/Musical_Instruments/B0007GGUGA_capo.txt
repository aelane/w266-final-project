I use a capo a lot so when someone recommended this...I thought they were crazy. I'm not paying that much for a capo and I doubt that is the problem. This capo works on my acoustics as well as electrics and is no-fuss with positive micro-action that allows you to apply just the right pressure by simply squeezing it down after it is in place. This capo, however, just works simply, smoothly, and it's a great pleasure to operate. But this capo takes away all the uncertainty and irritation of being a fraction out of tune with the rest of the band, or with myself. This means occasionally relying on a capo to get just the right key with just the right chord shape/structure. !Overall, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this capo - if you're like me - this could be a very inexpensive way to take your performance to the next level !!! Probably the best capo I have ever had. The G7th Performance Capo is by far the nicest capo I have had in 35 years of playing. Well, the G7th Performance capo is definitely the Worlds best at keeping your guitar in tune. I was looking for many different capo's but this one was my choice base on other folks review. The capo I had been using was putting WAY too much pressure on the strings, and  greatly exacerbated the existing issue... one that will ultimately need to be taken in and repaired.So he mentioned this capo, and I immediately chortled.

I bought this capo thinking it would look slicker without the clamp handles sticking out but what I found is that although it looks cool, it's complicated (which for a capo is saying something).

This capo is expensive, but I have never found one that works so well.
