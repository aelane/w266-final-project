Planet Waves has not only made a great, small, easy to install and easy to use tuner, they included the battery. I much prefer the Snark, but apparently I can't be bothered to remember to remove a tuner before putting my toys away. Consequently, I cannot recommend this tuner if the user needs to be moving it from one instrument to the other.If the need is for a tuner that attaches to ONE instrument and will, essentially, live there, it is nice little tuner which remains functionally invisible to all but the player. If you need to move the tuner from instrument to instrument, you would be well advised to spend a few more dollars and stick with the clip-on versions of Planet Waves tuners.November 28,2011 UPDATEHaving used this tuner for a while now, I have found that it has a good purpose. A non-built-in-built-in tuner at this price cannot be beat. I have both this tuner and a Snark for each of my instruments. I use a tuner on my Gibson Johnny Smith while I play but always take it off when I'm done playing. The tuner has an auto-shutoff function to preserve battery life.The power and frequency buttons are just nibs really; I'd prefer they be larger with more surface and a bit of click to them. The tuner can be calibrated in integer steps from 430 to 450 if 440 doesn't work for you.One advantage of a chromatic tuner is you can tune to a chord and aren't limited to (usually) diatonic open strings. Compared to my other tuner, it's rigt on the money. This little tuner is sweet! Previous to this my favorite tuner was a chromatic ukulele tuner built to clamp on the top of the headstock. The tuner has auto shutoff to make the battery last longer. If you need a tuner that is moved frequently there are better (and larger) choices. It can be moved but it is a good tuner to set and forget. This tuner will get you close quickly and you can use your ears to fine tune if necessary. I thought to try this tuner after my gig bag decided to break my Snark SN-2's neck (fragile plastic socket of the ball & socket joint bent with stress). I bought this tuner for my mandolin. I have to play a little louder than I'd like for the tuner to hear me. The Planet Waves tuner works effectively on acoustic and electric guitars, using the instruments vibrations to read pitch. The tuner seems to be reasonably accurate, is lightweight, and is easy to read without being obtrusive to the audience. It is also nice that such an inexpensive and small tuner can be adjusted to standards on either side of A-440. It's not that this tuner is unusable on other types of headstocks, it's just that the design limits where you can place it and still have it readable right-side up. This tuner is tiny and works as advertised to tune my guitar, bass and banjo. This being said, it's a nice tuner and stays on. Best I've ever found so far in a tuner. Its nice having a tuner right there at the ready whenever you need it.UPDATE:  Downgrading my rating by 1 star. I make sure to turn this tuner OFF before putting the guitar away, and when I get around to playing the guitar again (7 to 10 days later), the battery is already drained. Use this on my Taylor acoustic-electric which does not have a built in tuner. I finally have a tuner that fits right on my guitar headstock! Its very durable and accurate, and I like how I can step on it to engage both the tuner and cut out my guitar signal, so I can tune in silence and not annoy my friends and/or the audience. The tuner itself is made of fairly light duty plastic too, so as nice as it would be to keep this in your pocket on the way to a jam session, I still think it would be easy enough to break. This little tuner is excellent. This tuner is tiny and accurate. I had to play around with the tuner to figure out how the lever and ratchet clamp worked. Although concealing the tuner from my audience isn't a concern of mine, I would definitely recommend this tuner to someone with that concern. Third, buy it if you are looking for a new tuner. I really like this tuner. Cool little digital tuner  that works great on my ukulele. These aren't an expensive tuner comparatively speaking, and that's good. I am so happy with this tuner I am buying TWO MORE immediately, one for my Breedlove acoustic, another to keep as a spare. This tuner works by guitar vibration.

This is a decent to good little tuner, but there are some drawbacks to it.

I have a Gibson Les Paul and this tuner is awkward to use with it.- Less gradation in setting than other tuners.

I could attach the tuner with one hand by squeezing the clamp tight but it felt like I needed two to remove it: one to press the release and another to pull the clamp out.
