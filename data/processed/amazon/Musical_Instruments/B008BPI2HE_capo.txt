I've been searching for the 'perfect' capo for years now and this one's come the closest so far.The capo's well made and doesn't show any manufacturing flaws at all. As delivered, the capo fits the neck of my Taylor perfectly with just the right amount of tension. The Planet Waves capo has a nifty tension adjuster in case you have a different neck profile.I like that slips easily on the neck without a lot of mucking around. This capo seems to handle quite nicely. I expected the capo to work well on the narrower neck Gibson, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it worked well on the 2-inch nut width guitars as well. One of them is a capo. This capo is great because it doesn't simply rely on a loaded spring to clamp down. This new capo eliminates that in an efficient, effective and economical manner. I like this capo because it goes on quickly and there is no pulling the strings out of tune. This capo is adaptable to guitars with various neck radius shapes, and narrow neck, standard acoustic guitars, as well as acoustics with wider necks (e.g. The capo also has a handy built-in pick holder.This capo certainly meets my needs, and I've removed the G7th from my wish list. If you prefer a quick-change capo (as opposed to aShubb-style capo), the Planet Waves Capo is well worth considering. That in and of itself, makes this capo a five in my book. I used this capo on a Gibson J40, Hummingbird and a J-200. To compare this I tried a G7 capo, Kaiser and Schubb. Its a very well designed capo! When a capo doesn't have enough tension, it will slide around on the neck when your hand bumps into it which will result in buzzing. This capo works just fine. The only one I've found that doesn't is the Kyser...my "go to" capo for years. Since the capo was built for guitars with a radius fretboard, it does not work on classical guitars (or anything with a flat fretboard). The capo will not reach across the entire fretboard and since the cap is curved, it will not apply pressure on the middle strings.It's a nice capo but it may not be what you're looking for so I recommend looking into the other two big hits in capos. This capo is easy to install and move and does not seem to pull the strings thus maintaining tune.

I didn't use this capo on my 66 because I have it apart in order to make exact vintage reproductions of the body.Today's modern guitars use medium jumbo frets.

I also felt that once the capo squeezes the string down the only thing that is creating tone is the fret line between it and the bridge.

No capo is perfect.
