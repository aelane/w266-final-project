I would recommend this guitar to anyone looking at it!!!! This guitar is pretty good for the price. I was looking for a guitar with enough space between strings so that my fingers would not mute strings accidentally while practicing cords. This is not a small guitar or a thin body guitar. It rings out very well, so it is not a quiet guitar but is not likely to disturb your neighbors unless plugged in.Mine has some edges not well stained, likely due to glue squeeze out during assembly. This is an amazing guitar for the price. I wanted a classical guitar to round out my collection. The guitar has good tone and action. The guitar stays in tune nicely after the strings are broken in. The guitar sounds good both acoustically and amplified, but I prefer the acoustic sound.

I purchased this as my first classical guitar because I need a guitar I can plug in, overall I'm extremely impressed with it, it stays in tune pretty well, has shockingly low action for a classical, sounds great plugged in and unplugged, has a built in tuner, comfortable to play, overall I love the guitar, well worth the money!
