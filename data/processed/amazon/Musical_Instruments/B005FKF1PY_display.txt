The display is easy to read. Just remember to turn it off, or the display will prove distracting. The display and lock in speed of the original NS was better than the new one but the new one seems a bit more accurate for me. The display is not as nice or easy to interact with as some tuning displays I've seen. One would think that if the display were darker, less power would be drawn from the battery. I like the backlit display with simple markings that make easy to tell if you are in tune with a quick glance. The display is quite readable, even without glasses and features a color change to green when near or in tune. Also the display is smaller and as such, probably requires less power to operate which translates to longer battery life.

It's so light I don't notice it's there.The display is bright and easy to see in most light.

The display is small - a dime can cover most of it - but the characters are large enough to read in normal playing position.

The display uses bars to the side of the note letter and color to indicate tuning.
