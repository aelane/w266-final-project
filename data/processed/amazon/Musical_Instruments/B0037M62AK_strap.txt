Good strap, very comfortable and strong. Yes I would ,,buy is a great strap nice comfort nice priceFits nice in to my Fender guitar, a thumbs up Like the strap and the design specially when is on the shoulder, thank you! First of all this strap looks super cool. Throw some strap locks on it and away you go!! Sweet strap, nice colors, good quality. Don't forget your strap locks if you're planning to rock out :-)Looks great with my white Fender Jazz Bass Standard! This strap is pretty thin. The strap is of good quality and since its new it still feel stiff but I am happy that I got it. The strap looks great. I thought that this strap was the same as my others only with a different design. This strap is VERY thin and brittle feeling, which makes it very uncomfortable to use. This strap DOES slide easily on your shirt (which is what I prefer) but once it makes contact with your neck it is SHARP and it makes your neck sore and itchy. That is if it lasts that long.Overall what you need to know is that this strap is NOT the same as the other Planet Waves straps. If I would have paid $20+ on this strap I would be furious. But at only $7 this strap is still a steal. This strap has a fantastic old-school look and vibe, and I've never had it slip off while playing. I could never play with this strap without a shirt and sometimes if it rides up I can feel it on my neck (but that is very rare and only if playing with a loose t-shirt).

When I received the strap I realized it doesn't fit a banjo.

It's not the best strap in the world, but it's not bad.

I bought this strap because I thought the pattern was awesome!
