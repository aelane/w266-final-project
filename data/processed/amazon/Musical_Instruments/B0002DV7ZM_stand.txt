Get a heavier stand or a wall hanger if you have a fabulous vintage Martin or a handmade Henderson. this little stand is great. This stand folds into a pretty small package, but supports the guitar very solidly. This little stand collapses and sets up so easy. This is a very handy stand for keeping your guitar upright and safe where size and weight are important considerations. I used to bring along a much heavier stand that wasn't really designed for portability to keep my guitar from being knocked around. This stand does the trick beautifully. this stand is small but does the job.and folds up in to a small package.i have one for each guitar Sitting by itself, the stand is small enough to be out of the way but is able to hold my precious guitar securely when put to use. This stand feel sturdy and strong.Compact design on stand and folding for travel.Good for acoustic and electric guitars.Thick non scratch foam is a plus.Love it.

This is an good stand for situations where there aren't too many threats to your guitar (running dogs on the porch, reeling drunks at a bar).
