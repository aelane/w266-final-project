Their bright tone sounds great and full, while the color coded ball ends makes restringing a breeze. Because you like the tone they provide. They just lend to that awesome Vintage tone and seepage that people like me go nuts over. The tone produced by these stings is very good especially considering the low price. They are comparible in tone to Dean Markely's and Slinky's IMHO. Nice tone, last a decent amount of time, and they're cheap. I am currently using them on my Epiphone Sheraton and compared to the Fender Bullets I had been using, these stay more uniform in tone throughout their life. They help nail his tone and are slick, light, feel and handle bends perfectly. Great tone, great string life (with a little maintenance) and very reasonably priced. They hold their tone & tuning longer than others I've tried, and when you buy the bulk packs you can't go wrong on quality + value.

Great tone and it last long, feels great on your fingers.

These have good tone, but I can't see much of a difference over other brands at the same price point.

They have a melodic tone and good intonation, and they seem to be lasting and staying in good shape.
