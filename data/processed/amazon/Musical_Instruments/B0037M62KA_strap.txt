Love this strap! This is a very serviceable strap at a great price. nice strap, i meant its just a basic strap, so its not gonna blow your mind or anything but its of very good quality from what i can tell so far. Nice strap for the money. I bought this strap because I wanted to draw on it with sharpie and then cover it with a clear coat to preserve the sharpie. This is a good sized strap with a  nice drawing surface. This strap was barely more expensive than a cheap nylon strap! Nice strap but a bit too stiff ... might loosen up in time but certainly worth buying. I have a similar strap made of thicker leather that I really like but it cost 4 times as much. The strap is comfortable and adjustable. I liked the strap enough that I bought a couple of more in different colors. If you use this strap, you probably want to use some kind of strap locking system.I have leather straps that have lasted for over ten years. I could be wrong, but looking at the Planet Waves strap, I have doubts that it will hold up anywhere near as well or as long.If you are a casual player, this strap is probably fine, although strap locks are recommended. I decided to keep this strap, but it is installed on a secondary guitar that I don't play that much.

It is definitely longer than a normal strap by a few inches and it smells nice to boot.

All-in-all it's a good strap for the money, which wasn't much.

Oh and tight strap button holes?
