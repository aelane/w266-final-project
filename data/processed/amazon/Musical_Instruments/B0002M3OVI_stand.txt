If you're looking for a really durable stand, this is a good one for the desk. The adjustable stand also works great and won't fall on you or anything. So just make sure whatever it is you're buying can connect properly with the stand. This is a great stand. The stand has a low profile but also extends up tall enough to handle just about any size amp or combo amp. This little stand adjusts about six inches, so it's possible to get the mike right at mouth level without bending over. Not much to review about a simple tabletop mic stand. I bought this stand to mic a kick drum.

I bought this stand a few months ago and it has held up quite well.

This stand is basically dead weight.
