I wholeheartedly endorse the product. I am definitely proud of this product. The product works as advertised and Amazon has the best deal. The product picture can be a little deceiving. This is a great product. It is a  great product. This product does all the hard work for you easily, quickly and accurately. I'd definitely recommend this product to a friend. This is a very well made product. The product arrived on time, as shown, well packaged, for what I believe to be a fair price at about eight dollars and change. I think it is a well made product and good value. Overall this is an amazing product and I don't see a reason why I would ever want another tuner again.

Really love this product; works well, helps me stay in tune quickly, is helping me to train my ear to "hear" when I'm in tune.

Just an amazing product,  I even clipped it onto my piano and bought a $30 set of tools online and saved $100 tuning my piano myself!!
