This winder has a slot that will sorta fit across this tuning peg but it doesn't feel like it has enough of a grip to make turning it easier.I haven't had a chance to actually use it while changing strings yet, but so far it looks like it'll work as advertised in every other aspect. I recommend if you need a winder, just buy this. The winder works well for me, and the cutter is good to have connected to the tool (so I don't have to search out a pair of snips), but a spring loaded cutter would be less awkward. I actually like my Dunlop winder better; this tool is longer so it comes off of the pegs a little more, but I guess that's the compromise of having a working cutter, so I won't be throwing away my other winder any time soon. The winder I'm not going to use, but perhaps people with tired fingers would want to use it. I much prefer it without the winder. The winder is nicely balanced and the grip is good. The winder is great, but the cutter and pin pull is also part of it making it the only tool needed for changing out strings. I have used this winder now 4 times. This winder makes changing strings a breeze and I like that there's an integrated cutter to trim off the excess string. Cutter, winder and pin puller. The winder makes a loud and ear piercing squeaking when winding fast. The winder is a little awkward to use. The winder itself works quite well, and has slots for multiple-sized tuners. the winder works really well and same with the cutter, but using the cutter can be a bit cumbersome. The winder is nice and the clipper works well. This winder saves time,especially when you are anxious to get back to playing after breaking a string or replacing every string.This is not bulky & fits into several different guitar cases without taking up much room. With this winder, you are done in an amazingly short time. Overall, I like this winder. The winder, the cutter and the pin-pull all work well enough. The winder fit the winding keys nicely and didn't come anywhere near touching my guitar's finish. This winder and cutter...winds and cuts fine...But the pin puller does not fit my guitar pins even though the ad claims that, &#34;...it fits virtually all guitars, banjos and mandolins...&#34;  Oh well...another lessson learned.

Cutter works great, winder makes the job really fast.

Finally, a winder that has features and durability designed into it.

And as for the winder...
