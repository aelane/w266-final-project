My new go-to strings. Considering these strings cost much more than others, I certainly am disappointed in them. I've used these Elixir strings for years and I would never change. I really like the strings they sound very bright and go well with my guitar I do hope they last quite a while I put them on a bout a month ago but that guitar is only lightly played so I will try to update when I change them These strings are performance value and always give me a great sound. These are my favorite strings. I tried Martin strings once and hated them. They are very good strings, worth the cost! These strings are a little more money than the average strings, but they last longer. I've been using Elixir strings for many years. Therefore, strings that may sound good to my ear may not sound good to someone else's ear.My ears remain attentive to future string sounds. I love, love, love these strings. Elixir strings are great for me. Get these strings. These are great guitar strings and are all that guitarists say they are. Low E and A strings and the vulnerable G string.The LIGHT version I find, are particularly suited to finger picking. Yeah, that DNA really messes up guitar strings all right.

I've used these strings longer than any other strings I've tried (about 7 years).

I purchased Elixir strings after hearing them repeatedly recommended at the music store.

I have changed strings many, many times, so I am convinced it was not my stringing, but a weakness in the E string itself.
