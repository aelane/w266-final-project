these are the best strings around. So if you like standard not coated strings, the nano's are probably the way to go. Fresh strings do sound better. I only play Elixir strings. Elixir's Nanoweb Light Phosphor Bronze strings are the best strings I've ever used on my Alvarez acoustic -- a guitar I've now owned for over 30 years. They certainly are the longest lasting strings that seem to be out there, they have a nice punchy tone, and are easy on the fingers. However, you cannot go wrong with those strings. I love the Elixir strings. These strings are just okay - they last about 4 months and then they start to fray a little bit. I absolutely love these strings. Polyweb strings have a heavier coating so I prefer nanoweb for the ultra-thin coat and brighter sound. Favorite strings. Get these strings. These strings are noticeably warmer compared to the brighter Bronze Nanoweb. Best of all they last extremely long, but I've broken a few strings over the past months. Overall great strings and pretty consistent. I've been using Elixir strings for about ten years now.

Personally, I love the nanoweb strings.

As I'm no pro, I don't want to put strings on them that I'm going to have to change every time, just to mess around at my apt.I don't mind that they are extra slippery, or that they sound a tad bit "different" than other strings.

These acoustic strings are used on a Laguna acoustic guitar.
