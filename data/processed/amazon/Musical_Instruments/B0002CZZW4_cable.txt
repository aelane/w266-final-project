Good Quality cable and price. Sometimes I have to run a longer cable to a snake if I'm doing the big band thing. Otherwise, I use this cable at every show. As good or better than my Monster cable for a lot less money! The cable barely holds a signal now (constantly need to jiggle the thing to work). So it is definitely the cable :(Anyway, I gave it 2 stars because while it WAS working it sounded great through my Roland JC120. I recommend this cable without reservations. I keep this cable on my pedal board -Pedaltrain MINI With Soft Case. This cable works perfect for it's purpose. This is a pretty strong cable.

Although I have been using the cable for only a few weeks, I am very impressed.

This is my second Spectraflex cable and I love them.

This cable is built to be extremely durable, is made in the USA, and comes with a lifetime warrantee.
