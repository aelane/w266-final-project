When I first felt this strap, I smiled...This is so supple to the touch, making playing with it a great experience. This is the first strap that I've bought in a long time. I have a Planet Waves strap with studs and I like it very much. I'ts the only strap I've ever used. If yore looking for a new strap, I highly recommend this one. I got this strap just to try something different than a nylon. I almost feel like I wont even need strap locks it's so good. This strap is nice and comfortable but your guitar will fall off of it easily. I plan on using strap locks so it won't matter to me but if you don't use strap locks, your guitar may hit the floor and ruin your whole day.My advice. Install strap locks on all of your guitars and protect your investment. This strap is sturdy and robust, and it's plain black.

Looking for a strap that is sturdy, comfortable, and simple in design, I use this strap along with and without the Planet Waves quick release system, perfect for use when I am standing and playing.
