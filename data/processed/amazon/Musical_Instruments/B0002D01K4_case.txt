I am not a musican but wanted a case to carry my Epiphone Les Paul Custom Pro to the guitar guy for setup etc. love the case nice and simple, it really look exactly the same as the picture. Basically, this case is very sharp looking - made with good quality materials. The case would probably take a beating over time, but its not a SKB case. When I ordered the case I assumed it would be made for my guitar. I am sure I received a new case. I saw the Gibson case and I just don't see them as superior enough to justify paying more. Very nice case for the price. this case is the best i've ever had...very plush on the inside, and hard construction on outside is very strong...the handle extreamly soft to the touch...i guess all my other cases just don't measure up to this one...it even locks...if your guitar fits...but this for the quality!! Otherwise great case, highly recommended. It fits perfectly in the case, one of the best cases I own and have seen, the carpet is awesome, also has a pocket in the middle, what holds the neck up, and can fit a strap and even a pedal. Very durable case and seems like the younger brother of the more expensive Gibson case. The case itself is quite sturdy and the inside is very plush. Great case for small cash!

This case it built really well, it has really nice plush interior... storage area for picks-strings-tuning fork-etc in the neck, it DOES have a lock on one of the latches.

The case actually kind of stuck the first few days after i got; so much so that i thought it was locked with the key inside when i first got it.

The case is hard on the outside and soft on the inside as it should be.
