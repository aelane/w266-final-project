These are good strings, but not 5 stars good. Martin strings, just wish I could afford a Martin guitar. They are good strings! I dont see that they are any better than other basic strings in their price range. These are excellent strings for the price and I will buy them again. The light strings carry excellent deep tone and are not to hard on my fingers. Have not used the strings yet, I bought them as back up. these strings are great for the price, they sound nice and are pretty long lasting but dont last or sound as nice as higher end strings but who cares when the strings are affordable. these strings are great for people are starting because its cheaper and its not a big deal when you break a lot of strings. this strings are just perfect for me because the sound it is nice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1!!!!! The Martin M140 strings are good strings. I change strings about every 2 to 4 months and play about an hour a day. These strings lasted abotu 2 and a half months before they started to sound flat.

These strings sound great on an acoustic when properly tuned, I bought these at a local shop after looking at a different brand.

I started experimenting on strings, I say, why wouldn't I try to use bronze strings for my acoustic guitar?

I'm hooked to bronze strings.
