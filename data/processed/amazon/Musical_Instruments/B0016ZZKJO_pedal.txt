This pedal is more subtle then the Boss but if you want some delay to fatten up those lead tones and retain the sound of your amp then look no further. I already own a MXR Dyna Comp & Phaser 90 pedal so I took the leap and bought this delay. It's a great pedal that may well replace how much reverb you use... This pedal is intended to just color your tone a little bit and it does so in a spectacular way. You can get all the great delays out of this one pedal. this pedal worked well, but I sent it back because thru my marshall itgenerated a lot more line noise than I like, other than that it was cool!!! This pedal is capable of all of those (though the "U2" style delay is better achieved with digital). This is a great pedal, very well made and fairly compact so as to fit in pretty well on my small pedal board. I already had this pedal, but needed to add a little delay to two separate channels (stereo).

Sometimes I just leave the pedal on with the mix knob dialed down for subtle ambience in my tone.One minor criticism is that the modulation effect is subtile, at least out-of-the-box.

Love this pedal.

This pedal is just another little pedal on your board that will deliver.
