I want to like this more but it's not as good as my other tuners. I have bought several small tuners through the years, but this one has become a favorite. I have tested it against other, older and larger tuners and all tune to the same accuracy, which is very good.I docked it one star because the screen doesn't stay on (in my opinion) long enough when I am trying to tune a string. It works, but I find other tuners easier to use that have screens that stay on longer with each pick.Perhaps a more experienced guitar play may only need that brief flash of tuning information to tune a screen, but for me I find it easier to have the tuning information displayed longer.Also this tuner is tiny. These are a little tricky to mount but do track well, and are not obnoxious looking like the Snark tuners. They seem slower to lock then my Snark tuners, and the visual scale is not as precise, but they do seem to work fairly well. I own several small tuners, including the Enote nano tuner and the Snark. I have other tuners but this one is the best. I have always liked the Planet Waves tuners for ease of use and accuracy. However there are other more responsive tuners, such as the capo-tuners we've seen on Amazon lately. It replaces several other tuners I have been using that hung off the headstock and tended to come loose and fall off or had to be constantly re-secured and positioned (and removed/re-attached when I transferred my guitar to/from the case).

For myself, I only use tuners to set the pitch of one string, usually the low A for guitar or bass and low G for mandolin.

I'll keep the new NS tuners for now and hope that D'Adarrio (or someone) improves on it with a better processor and LED.

Broke one of my Snark tuners when I kept it on a guitar while putting it in the case to take to a gig and decided I needed a tuner I could keep on any guitar while it was in any case.Pros:- Fits on any guitar- ...which then fits in any case- Cheap- AccurateCons:- Calibration button and on/off button are same shape, same size, and on the same tiny surface.
