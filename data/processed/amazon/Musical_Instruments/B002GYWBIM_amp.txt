If you're still hesitant about buying this or any other Spider amp, just buy it. I just bought this amp for my Epiphone Goth Studio guitar, I've got it this weekend and I'm very satisfied with this product. I'm not a proffessional but this amp is really good for the price you pay as it comes with so many functions, with complete add-ons on th webpage. I've had this amp about a week now and I'm still finding cool things about it. It's a small amp but it's bigger than I thought it would be. I would buy this amp again if mine was stolen. Other than that an awesome amp. I bought this amp back when i didnt know much about amps. This Line 6 amp has a flat sterile sound that isnt very warm sounding. I've had the amp for 2 months or so now and love it. The amp looks nice with the chrome knobs and is very simple to use. This little amp is awesome, I once had a Peavey Bandit 112 back in the day, and this little guy can do all it could do, it just doesn't get as loud, but at least you won't have to worry about someone calling the cops on you for being too loud, but is gets just loud enough, so be careful.

This is a highly feature-full amp at this price point.

Overall I recommend this amp to anyone looking for a cheaper home practice amp.
