I used to swear by Hard and stiff picks on my Les Paul Custom, but I recently bought a Strat '62 re-issue--and these are TOO MUCCH FUN for fast rhythms with a WAH or Phase 90 (phaser) pedals!! I have tried few picks, textured, mallow color, and this bright green. Love these picks. I like the picks a lot! I've been using these picks for 10+ years, they've always been great. I love these picks. Good picks, great feel and brings out sound loudly. Finally decided in getting the 1.00mm picks because I don't like them too thin or too thick, this was the perfect gauge I was looking and hoping for. John Mayer uses these picks and hes one of my favorite guitarist so I am sticking with these. I've used these picks for years with great results. Tortex is great i really like their picks there may be better but these have fit the bill i prefer the yellow ones they are a little thinner These are the only picks I use when playing my acoustic guitars (strumming style & vocals). I love these picks for playing my acoustic. And these picks are inexpensive enough that you can keep an endless supply. I use the green 88mm picks, and also the orange 60mm ones. I recommend you buy both the green picks and orange picks. I don't seem to drop these at all as compared to other picks I have used in the past that just seemed to slip.... my favorite picks. These are such comfortable picks... Cheap and easy to use, can't beat these picks!

I think Tortex / Delrin picks are the standard that others are judged by.Durable, good to gripping surface, easy to identify thicknesses by color.The only way I can think of to improve these would be to replace the black ink logo and script with some sort of raised embossing.Then your fingers will not smudge and the grip would be even better.Take a look at "Cactus Picks" to get an idea of what I mean.

At first I messed around with all the different picks I could get my hands on.
