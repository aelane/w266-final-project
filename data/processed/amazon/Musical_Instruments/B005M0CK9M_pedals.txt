Much quieter than the other two pedals mentioned. Most of the overdrive pedals work very poorly on bass. This was one of their top-rated pedals, so I figured I'd give it a go. I very much like how Joyo has reproduced some great sounding pedals for amazingly low prices and seemingly high quality for the average guitarist that just cannot afford to spend thousands on these overpriced "boutique" pedals. I'm super happy with my Joyo pedals. I put my pedals through three tests, 1) playing alone, 2) Playing at rehearsal, and 3) gigs. I can't think of any other pedals I've owned that could do this. I have several other OD pedals: Tube Screamer, LovePedal Kalamazoo and even a cheap Danelectro DS-1.

I've recently discovered these pedals, and if money/pedalboard space were no issue, there's probably 8 to 12 of them I'd like to own.The "star" of the Joyo lineup, however, is arguably the JF-02 Ultimate Drive.

Right now, I have three pedals that are fairly similar and offer a great "overdriven Marshall" tone: The Fulltone, the Ultimate Drive, and the Marshall GV-2 Guv'nor.

While they are all great pedals, the Joyo really hits the sweet spot on my Vox Combo amp (using a Gibson Les Paul).As for soloing/lead play, I'm noticing all types of pick attack/harmonic response with the Joyo that I don't get with other stompboxes.
