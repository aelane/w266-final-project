Having played guitar for 45 years, I have tried and used many, many capos. Any guitar player who has gone from one to the other (capo) over time, searching for the one that really does what it is supposed to do all the time, will find this new capo from Planet Waves a welcome tool in the quest to produce clear tones and great sounds on a six-string guitar. I've been playing guitar and using capos for 23 years. I've learned this...if you are a serious guitar player there are many "must-have" items you need in your arsenal. By clamping one on a guitar you can raise the pitch and key of the entire guitar relative to the tuning it is in. It is very lightweight and works fine on my Epiphone electric guitar. I've been playing guitar for about 7 years now, and I've always used the Kaiser capo, but since I got this planet waves one, the kaiser just gathers dust in my guitar case. I don't often capo my guitar.

I have been playing guitar for longer than I care to admit.

I would perfectly tune the guitar with the Snark and then apply the capo.

I have an electric guitar, a nylon and a Recording King ROS-06 with a chunky neck.
