With the distortion set to minimum (it never gets clean) it's a good, moderate-gain overdrive that still lets your guitar's basic tone get through. Is this the best distortion pedal? Boutique and distortion are an oxymoron.These things are built with heavy metal, it should last, I kinda hope it doesn't(just kidding), you want distortion, you got distortion This is a distortion pedal. ... it's a very generic-sounding distortion and is not really useful for much beyond a lead boost into an already distorted amp. If you want a basic, solid, well-built distortion pedal, this is it - but by itself the Boss DS-1 is really nothing special. This is an excellent distortion pedal for people who want a traditional rock sound. But you can easily boost the distortion achieved by the DS-1 by using it with your amp on an overdriven setting.

The distortion was harsh, thin, artificial sounding and always noisy.

Its a rich, full distortion that at higher gains gets slightly fuzzy.

If you're looking for your first distortion pedal to use with your 15-watt practice amp, look no further.
