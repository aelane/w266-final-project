Great little power source. With this, you get the power adapter, the extension cable (to hook up multiple stomp boxes), and a bag full of converter cables. The power adapter is smartly built so that it will only take up one slot on your surge protector or in your wall outlet.So far, I have used it successfully only to power two pedals, so I cannot speak to how it handles powering an entire pedal board. Bought this to power all my stomp boxes, wha peddle, tuner etc. The 'One Spot' provides the power needed, the wiring is just right for the pedals I've installed. My power strip now has more space for other "toys" to make my weak playing sound better. Quiet power supply, lots of cables and end caps and adapters, for what you'd pay for a single power adapter. this will power many pedals with low milliamperage ratings. I bought this power supply for in home use - I don't do too much gigging or recording, so this is primarily used for practicing or just messing around. Best of all, all of your power needs for all your pedals only takes up one outlet spot in your home. All you need is a power conditioner and you are ready to plug in. for those who have 9 volt power adapters of the more modern kind, they fit these, too. Getting a proper pedal power unit (like Voodoo labs, DC brick, Ciok) is recommended. I usually use this to power two or three pedals and most of the time it is ok. Any more than that, and you will have some loss of headroom in the pedals. May not power some pedals that have a high current draw.

I power 7 pedals and Absolutely no noise distortion comes from the pedals with this hooked up, If anything it sounds better than a battery, FOR SURE.

I needed 220V power overseas and so I ordered this.

I use this to power a Big Muff Pi, mxr compresser, Ibanez Tube Screamer, and a Planet Waves tuner pedal.
