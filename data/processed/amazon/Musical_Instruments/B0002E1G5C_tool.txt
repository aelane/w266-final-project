This tool does exactly what it is supposed to do and is a reasonably priced product. As with any tool there is a small learning curve just to become familiar with the way it functions. This is an indispensable tool for all guitarists who constantly change strings. The tool is made of sturdy plastic. The tool fits inside my hard shell Gibson guitar case. This is a very nice tool. This is a must have tool and isn't cheap like most of the plastic ones out there. This is a great tool the only issue was it was a little tight and it squeaked loudly as i was attempting to use it..  i had some graphite powder and i put a little around the screw head on the winder part and now it spins freely without noise. I'd be lost without this tool. What can you say about a tool. This tool definitely comes in handy for anyone who works on a guitar. Great tool. Like any other tool, it doesn't always fit or please everybody. This tool came and while it is nice and I will be sure to use it, It is not a MUST have. best tool ever still i think is a good tool to have. This is a handy little tool. This versatile tool does what it says it does. But, after purchasing, I realized that a tool like this isn't too necessary. instead of having half your tool box out just to restring your ax all you need is one tool. This tool has high marks for one reason: It works. After you have used this tool for the first time, you say to yourself,...&#34;why did I suffer all those years by doing this manually?&#34; I used to devote so much time to sitting there, winding forever by hand. This is a tool to carry in your guitar case at all times ! The tool works great and is sturdy. It's made pretty well for a plastic tool. this tool Is AWESOME!
