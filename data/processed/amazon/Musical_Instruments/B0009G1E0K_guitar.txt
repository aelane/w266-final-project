While ordering a guitar case, the guitar strap popped up and I could not pass up the deal. I bought another heavy LP guitar recently and thought I'm going to use Fender "leather" strap I bought in Target a while ago (not sure why  - i never buy guitar stuff there) it looks good then. Bought this for my Kona K2 acoustic, it fits and holds well on the guitar with the leather ends. The guitar pick pocket on the the leather ends is a nice addition to keep your picks at hand. This is my first guitar belt, it is not a good fit, the connection to the guitar is far too thick, I try to not remove it too often as it is highly inconvenient and hard to manage. I am pleased with this guitar strap and feel it will do great for the young musician in our home. Well executed black guitar strap. This guitar strap is very stiff and cuts into my neck. Especially when you take off the guitar for a break. It's a guitar strap. It holds up the guitar. There are other guitar straps that are nearly the same quality for half the price. What can I say about a guitar strap. It fits the guitar well and is a nice strap for the price. The guitar strap is not very comfortable, but it does the job. my guitar strap was old, I replaced it with this one as I didnt want to head into town,, is black and no frills. Very good guitar strap! They were VERY difficult to get on my guitar pegs (not a bad thing as my old strap popped off with the slightest pressure).

I recently purchased two Protec guitar straps in order to avoid having to switch straps between instruments.

Using this on my Ibanez ART100 electric guitar.

However, if you are tall and like to sling the guitar a bit on the low side, this is not what you need.
