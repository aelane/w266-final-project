Holds ~8-10 picks depending on thickness. It only holds 5 heavy picks but to be fair there has to be a spring in there so its ok. it hold my picks well, but some are to big for it and the tape/foam on the bottom looses the stick quickly. I no longer lose or misplace my picks. I use Clayton 1.26mm picks, a heavy pick but certainly not oversized. My picks don't fit!!! It does not hold more picks than its predecessors 5000 and 5005. It holds some 4 or maybe 5 picks while the 5005 holds around 7 (if you use 0.60. gauge picks or lower). I have mi picks available and all in the same place with this pickholder. Does what it is designed to do, it holds about 6 picks. It does what it is intended to do, holds my picks! The picks go in and come out nicely. it holds about 6 to 7 picks. I can put 6, 7 picks on it. They are great for holding picks & make wonderful gifts. I have had as many as 12 picks stored in one and as few as ONE pick stored in others. It holds your picks and sticks to your guitar. If you're always dropping picks, losing picks, breaking picks, this is perfect to have. My picks fall out way too easy while i'm playing live I store my picks in there and I put it by my table. It doesn't hold very many picks, but it really doesn't have to. I lose picks constantly. I bought this so I can keep some extra picks handy... now if I can just decide where to adhere it, to my guitar or my music stand?

This Dunlop "Ergo Pickholder" is so convenient for storing picks directly on the guitar.

It may work well with Dunlop picks but not for thePlanet Waves 10 Standard Guitar Picks - Duralin Blue ###GT!!!
