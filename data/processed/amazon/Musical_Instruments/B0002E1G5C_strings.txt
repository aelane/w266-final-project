It's easy to use and cuts the strings precisely and cleanly. Changing strings is no longer a dreaded chore. Easy to use and makes changing out strings easy. Works a little better at winding strings than the bare-bones winders. Maybe if you change strings a lot, then this could be a key part of you equipment bag. Its great for cutting strings but the winder is pretty difficult if you don`t know what your doing. Bought it to replace strings for my Taylor.Does all the job that I need it to perform.Winds the strings fastPulls the pegs smoothlycuts the excess wireDOES NOT SCRATCH MY GUITAR!! Cut the strings like they was made of paper.Really good price. Yes, you really replace your strings very fast with this Winder. And it also cuts the strings. I know that you can easily change strings without paying for a tool to help you out, but honestly this thing is worth every penny. It is very hard to accurately cut the strings. But when I am winding new strings, it often slips off. Noted,  I've only used it to cut Elixir Nanoweb strings and nylon strings and they more on the soft side compared to regular steel strings. I love being able to wind the strings, pull bridge pins and cut excess string with one tool! I like to trim my strings and the cutters also work well. Just changed strings on my Epi Les Paul and this winder\cutter performed flawlessly. After all, that's 2 more strings than its intended purpose!These perplexing questions aside, I find this to be an excellent and ideal tool.
