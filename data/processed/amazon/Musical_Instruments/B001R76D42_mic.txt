I purchased this mic to use for screencasts (recording what's happening on my PC's screen while I talk about it). BUY this mic, for 30bucks you will,be surprised The mic does exactly what I wanted it to do. The mic has a headphone jack. The mic is permanently attached via a swivel  to a strong clip that also serves as a desktop stand, and when not in use the mic folds into the clamp for protection. That was surprising since it's a USB mic. It is a tiny mic; it'll fit completely on your palm, but it can record very loud noises very clearly. this mic is perfect it gets the job done sounds clear has settings on it clamps on your lap top

The mic is somewhat more sophisticated than the Snowflake in terms of "latency" settings (it permits direct monitoring via headphones connected to the mic to insure no delay, or lag time, between transmission and reception), and there's a three-way switch for directional patterns (the manual could be clearer, however, about the difference between "cardioid" and "cardioid 10 pad.")

The mic performed virtually flawlessly right out of the box, with no tampering with the switch.It's extremely sensitive, slightly more so than the Snowflake.

Either mic will exceed the capabilities of your computer's built-in mic and perhaps the owner's expectations.
