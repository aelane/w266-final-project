Dunlop capos are functional and inexpensive. Come on, capos don't have &#34;tone.&#34;  Just get one that doesn't get in your way. I love these Dunlop capos. Be careful about using capos like this, because if you're using a fine guitar, it may damage the finish. As capos go, this gets the job done at a good price. I tested the capos on a standard acoustic and also an electric guitar. Both capos had this very same problem.When I received these capos, I noticed right away that they were not the same excellent quality as actual Jim Dunlop capos. I have owned other capos, but this one is simply the best.

I've used the classic Kyser capos for years with my acoustic guitars.

These trigger capos may look and feel awkward to a lot of people, but they are wonderful.

I had always used the Kyser clip-on-the-top capos (and still do), but I liked the look on this Dunlop clip-on-the-bottom model.
