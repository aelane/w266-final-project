These are the best strap locks in my opinion, good quality, easy to install and remove, secure, and they look good. yes, if your willing to swap out strap locks with originals these work fine...i did have a problem with drilling new holes into my guitars...but its explained what  size bit to use so wasnt a big problem...i tried not to drill on most of my guitars  some fit without drilling some did not..good luck...good price welll made.. best strap locks ive ever used, dunlop has always had great products.easy to install and i highly recomend them to any bass player These strap locks were easy to install and use right off the bat. Not only do they securely hold the strap to the guitar they also look pretty good. because it makes strap install and removal so simple and reliable,...and when the strap is clipped into place it is secure. Does what it says it will do - keeps your strap locked on. However, I found it was easier just to buy a strap for each guitar. The strap lock was still on the strap and locked into the holder. When I was installing these strap nuts, I screw in a half turn at a time, and applied lots of pressure so that the the head won't strip. I ordered strap pins only a few months ago to put on a few more recent guitars and one of the push button locks finally went out. It was on the strap I used the most for the heavier guitars so I got some mileage out of that thing. If you happen to be without a strap with locks on it, these new pins can be used like regular pins but are larger so a strap will be pretty much secure.The price is good, price them anywhere else and include shipping. But a new strap and put these on right away. I replaced the Schaller strap locks on my Strat with these. They are a little difficult to attach to the strap if the thickness of the strap is a bit on the thicker side. Dunlop is not the best strap lock system because it's a pain to switch which way the lock is pointing and people complain that the button is easy to unhook while playing. The Dunlop strap locks work pretty well, but the standard hole cut in a standard leather strap is not big enough to accomidate the locking buttons. The strap has to be modified by increasing the size of the holes. I like this strap lock very strong very sturdy!

The strap button has a radius about 3/16ths of an inch.

Schaller's strap locks might look a little more elegant to some players.

Just be sure to tug on it after you put your strap on to make sure it's on right.
