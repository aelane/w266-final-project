I payed the $11 for this just because the tuner I have was so slow to respond I needed something new. This is the best tuner I've used in over a decade of playing various instruments. This isn't a terrible tuner, and for how cheap it was, it wasn't a "ripoff". I love this little tuner. I really love this little tuner, I just keep it on the headstock of my guitar when playing & just touch up tuning if needed. It's a tuner that tunes nearly as well as a rack tuner for a fraction of the cost. Again, it's a clip-on tuner so don't expect razor-sharp accuracy. Wanted a tuner not dependent on a quiet environment.So far, works well.Sometimes slightly imprecise on a bass string, but generally works great. Never using another tuner again in my life. This tuner works great! This tuner really delivers, its inexpensive and accurate , much better than the SN1. "I keep a tuner on each guitar and one in my gig bag, just in case. No, this tuner is NOT super tight. I bought this because the tuner in the RP1000 is pretty sloppy. Love this little tuner. if you want a great tuner try a pedal corded tuner. If your looking for a great, fast and accurate tuner for your guitar or bass, this is the one for you. I don't go anywhere without it, it may well be the last tuner you'll ever need.Flaws are few. It would just be nice if it included one is all.All told, if you need a great tuner, look no further, this is one of the best, especially for the price paid. This is the third Snark tuner (the others were Snark II) I have bought. Great tuner. I had to get used to this tuner at first. This is a very useful tuner since it's small, fast and pretty rugged. This tuner does a great job tracking notes rather quickly, and I've enjoyed using it. This is hands-down the best tuner I've *ever* owned.

Snark claims that it's their best tuner yet.

For under $20, these little tuner is all you need.....fast and accurate.

Where the tuner attaches to the guitar and where the tuner attaches itself to it's own clip is where this little gem falls short.
