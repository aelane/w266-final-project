I put Aquila strings on it and now it sounds so good. I would definitely recommend these strings to any uke player looking to replace their stock nylon strings with something better. My first Kala Ukulele had these strings on it from the factory and I've never switched brands. Everywhere you read, these are the strings to have! I use Aquila and Martin strings in my ukuleles, the Aquila for most performances, and the Martins for those songs that require a faster strum pattern or a more traditional &#34;Hawaiian&#34; sound, as the Aquilas are a tad heavier than Martin. I bought these strings to replace the set that came on the instrument. Best Ukulele strings I have found to date. Everywhere I go, anytime I hear 'ukulele', I also hear 'Aquila strings.' I've tried several different uke strings for both my soprano and my concert ukes, and I've got to say, these are not my favorites. I much prefer the Martin Clear Flurocarbon strings! Not much more can be said about these awesome strings...stop reading this and order them!

There are other wonderful strings (Fremont flouros, Worths, etc.

These strings sound much better - the sound is much brighter and &#34;cleaner&#34; than the nylon strings my ukulele was supplied with when new.

The Aquila strings took about 30 minutes of continuous playing and stretching until they settled and now they stay tuned for long periods.
