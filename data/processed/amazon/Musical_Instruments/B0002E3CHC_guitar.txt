I'm impressed with these EXP16 guitar strings. We have two beginner guitar players in the house and we are very hard on strings, so these are a good choice for us.We are very pleased with the way they sound, feel, and last, so will likely pick up these again the next time we need to replace the strings.Recommended!CFH On my acoustic guitar that's irrelevant, the ends are hidden inside the guitar behind the pegs. I am an acoustic guitar addict. As with ALL guitar strings, they should be wiped with a dry, lint-free cloth after each and every playing. I don't know if it's my guitar (Taylor 214CE) or the strings, but I can not get over how great the quality is even after months of use. D'Addario guitar strings are favourite strings. I've been playing guitar for more than 20 years. this one is very good, long lasting guitar strings.

Since they were on the guitar, I decided to give them another try.

I've been playing guitar for years and personally I would prefer Cleartone or Elixir strings.

Any lighter and the guitar sounds "tinny", any heavier and I fear strings putting undue stress on the neck.
