I have 3 tuners whose heads are separate from the base. I tested it with other tuners and it's right on. It's cheap, yet works better than most tuners that require a plug in that end up costing around slightly more. I haven't used other tuners of this type, but this one works great and seems like a great value for the price. I hate the tuners that give you bad readouts with weak batteries. I highly recommend these tuners. I have several tuners. I rarely use any of my other tuners anymore, relying mostly on the Snarks that I have. These tuners are just awesome! I own several of the Snark tuners, but the Snark SN-2 is my personal favorite. (ORIGINAL REVIEW)I have had similar tuners in the past... and by similar, I mean clip on...Nearly every other tuner I have had has not maintained a reading, which translated into what felt like a game of keep away, where I was the frustrated kid in the middle who could never quite catch the pitch.I am willing to bet that lots of folks have had this experience with many tuners. Not only that, but many of these tuners run upwards of twenty bucks, if not more.So I was skeptical. These tuners are very handy to make quick tuning corrections while playing. I must have had over 20 tuners in the last few decades, and the Snark is by far my favorite.

I've used electronic tuners for a long time.

Other tuners I've tried using the vibration setting had difficulty feeling the &#34;E&#34; string vibrations thus making it hard to tune.

I do not treat my tuners rough, but it is easy to drop them.
