These strings are great for all sorts of playing styles. All in all though, these are great strings, and I will definitely continue to buy Ernie Ball, I'll probably opt for 10's or 11's though. Good cheap strings for guitar. Very clean very bright strings i use these on my strat and it feels good and sounds amazing. if you want to use these strings for distortion you're an idiot these are something i could imagine david gilmore using Highly recommend these strings.... I do like these strings. Good strings ..great for general guitar work, but I do prefer the EB rock n' roll strings for blues and rock playing. These are my favorite strings to use on my American Strat! I would definately recommend these strings to any electric guitar user... buy a pack and try them out! Decent strings but the little E string broke while I was stringing the guitar.Other than that, they appear OK.Nothing to rave about. These strings honestly aren't for rhythm. Nice strings. Since they are light strings they are easier to press down and easier to bend which really helps me because I'm a beginner and don't have much Calais yet.

These are awesome strings!

I change strings every other time I play a show (about once a month) and these always last, and sound good.

Fine strings that I have been using for a VERY long time of my electric guitars.
