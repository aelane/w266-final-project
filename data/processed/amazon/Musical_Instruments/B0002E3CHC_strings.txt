Coated strings usually lack the bright high-end brilliance that uncoated light strings have. When I put Light strings on my acoustic, I'm going for easy playability and, most of all, a very bright and airy sound. * DurabilityThe coating on these strings are supposed to prolong the time between changes. I've used D'Addario strings for many, many years without problems - both acoustic & electric. I've tried these coated strings in the past, and I actually prefer them to Elixir because they feel more like regular strings - the wrap is coated, rather than a sheathe being placed over the entire string, like on Elixirs.Do they last longer? These strings are more expensive because they are supposed to last longer. They sound great, and play great and I usually purchase D'Addario or Martin strings. Change the strings every couple of months. Good strings, though in 1 use I didnt notice any significant improvement over the standard Diaddario phosphor bronze strings. These are great strings. Changing strings is no fun so if over the lifetime of your guitar you have to do so 1/3 less, that is a good deal even if they don't last forever. These strings sound great with great dynamics on them. These D'Addario "EXP16 Phosphor Bronze Light" strings for acoustic guitars produce decent sound and are designed to last longer than "normal" strings. Elixir coated strings were by far my favorite strings for my acoustic guitar. These strings are packaged in three two string loops inside a single plastic bag. Ah, you know I'm just so used to strings that are individually looped. Two strings looped together makes a mess while I'm restringing a guitar - when I unwrap that pair, I've got a string that has to sit out unwrapped on the bench. I also dislike that the strings are in one plastic bag. If the strings are in individual labeled packages, there's no need for the colors.D'Addario loves the color coded end rings so much, they do a horrible job color coding and simplifying their packaging. To play as well as I am able, I require strings that respond to my touch and do not tear my fingers up. These light strings go from .012 to .053 as compared to my old Martin's which went from 0.012 to 0.054.In summary, D'addario makes good strings and these are no exception. If you're looking for coated acoustic strings with a muted (as opposed to aggresive) tone with lighter low E, then you should check these out. I might experiment with the EXP15s, but by and large, these EXPs are my new strings. I like to bend strings on acoustic in certain contexts, which can be tough with tight strings; the EXP's feel very easy - not electric guitar easy mind you, but fine for acoustic.The other quality that's noticeable is sustain. The strings I took off weren't completely dead and I wasn't expecting a dramatic difference, but it's noticable across the board, especially on small chord comping on three or four strings at a time.The tone also feels a bit more balanced across all six strings, but this is admittedly very subjective: I play with differently shaped and thicknessed picks for different recording contexts; some generate more percussive pick noise than others; sometimes I want it, other times no. These strings last a good long time and are rather inexpensive. Personally I just love the D'Addario strings. The EXPs are nice strings. I imagine these strings may work in some instances, but i am going back to the phospher bronze for my guitars. This is going to be hard to believe, but the strings on the acoustic were last changed more than two decades ago.When we put these new strings on the guitar (Lotus), the sound, as you might imagine, was incredible--bright and clear.These are fairly pricey, but I am very impressed with the quality. You can not go wrong with D'Addario strings. You can not go very wrong with these strings if you play often. Back when strings were a lot more expensive, some guys used to take their strings off the guitar and regularly clean or even boil them; some bass players still do. Coated strings are a simpler alternative.These strings and similar ones like Elixirs have a thin polytetrafluoroethylene coating bonded to the wrappings, which accomplishes two things: First, it creates a barrier between the atmosphere and the metal wrap, which prevents rust and corrosion. The strings stay fresher sounding two or three times as long as standard strings. You're probably changing strings for every performance to make sure you're getting a bright sound. You're probably also buying your strings by the box. With coated strings, I can leave a set on a guitar, and a month or two later I can pull it out of the case and it's ready to play. I still change strings if I'm going to be playing in public, but for guitars that spend most of the time sitting around the house, these are great. These strings are the bomb! D'Addario EXP'16s are probably the most musical strings I have ever used. I think I have found my strings and I don't see myself using anything else for a while. While I love and trust D'Addario strings, i am subtracting one star because, I really like the packaging for other strings when they have individual packets. Especially if you like to save your single strings for use. These strings can produce very good sound with little effort, I almost always use light/light medium picks with these strings and it can get to the volume I want. I'm glad I tried out these D'Addario strings. These strings are an excellent complement to my Washburn, which has mellowed out over the years. I like them, but these strings are probably not for everyone. Other than that, the strings are just a little squeaky. I feel like you could probably get some pretty equivalent strings for less money but my sister is very happy with these. I've long been partial to D'Addario strings--I don't have a guitar without them. I like D'Addario strings, but these did not impress me. I've played 6 strings, 12 strings, bass acoustics and electrics. Some strings have a "bright" sound and some have a clear, distinct tone - not muted or dull. Still, other strings have a rich, full resonance that carries through a room. These strings last and they moderated some of the booming I get from other strings. These strings sound great. GHS strings are much cheaper and much better strings than these. These guitar strings sound about the same after a month of playing as they do right after I change them. One doesn't get much better than D'Addario strings.

Uncoated strings last me about a month.Depending on the style of play, I prefer brighter or warmer strings, but I'd rank the EXP16s somewhere in the middle.

I've been using these strings for about eight years, and I also use them on my two Taylor's (814-CE & I use the mediums on my 710) I agree with the other reviewer in saying they are the best sounding coated string out there.

@highlight

I still use Martin strings once in awhile, but these strings last and improve in sound as they get a few hours of play on them.Actually I own three other acoustics other than my two Taylor's and right now they're all strung with EXP's.
