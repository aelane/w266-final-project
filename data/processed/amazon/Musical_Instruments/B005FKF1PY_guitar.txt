This is shown on an electric guitar and it would probably be great there. This one will stay on my guitar the others I always took off once it tune as they look so  awkward I have used many clip-on guitar tuners. If you are playing a really nice, (collectible) guitar, be cautious because these tuners, (and capos too,) can damage the finish permanently. Since I never take it off of the guitar, I went ahead and trimmed off the little tabs on the front of the clamping mechanism, making it even more unobtrusive. The other plus is that since it small and my guitar case has a little wiggle room, I don't have to take the tuner off. I put it on my strat-style guitar and it works brilliantly. On my slothead guitar it alsobarely fits. As long as it fits on your guitar, the Planet Waves tuner is highly recommended. I'm also trying to tune my semi-acoustic guitar as quietly as possible, so using my ear for fine tuning is not a viable option.Does it get the job done? For my full-sized guitar, the tuning was easier, but I had some difficulty on the low E string.

I've been playing guitar more than 35 years and have used a lot of electronic tuners.

I've been playing guitar for the last 9 years, and I currently have two other tuners.

I wear my guitar fairly low, so I was able find an area where I can see it from the top down, but those who sling it a bit higher might be outta luck.
