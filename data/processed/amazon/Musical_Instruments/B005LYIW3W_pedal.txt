I'm so impressed with this pedal that I've ordered the Sweet Baby and will probably get a couple of others while they're still cheap. I can not comment on this as I have never played this pedal. great pedal and great value. This was my fourth Joyo pedal and I believe Joyo and the Dano Cool Cat line are some of the better deals going these days in terms of price/quality. This Joyo JF-03 Crunch Distortion pedal is just amazing! This is also a very solidly constructed pedal that will hold up well to a lot of abuse. This is a great pedal for the $$ and it feels heavy and solid like any major brand. This pedal is amazing. this pedal ...i tried it out thru a silver face fender twin...wow, it cranks,..!..it really will produce marshall plexi tones....especially noticeable in the lower registers...on the E and A strings...if you want a marshall  stack sound , this is it,,,if you wanty a variety , i would recommend using this in line with one or two other distortions, so you can chose any amp sound you need,,,really people, for these prices i bought one of every pedal these guys make...and they all are super,,! I've been very happy with all of my Joyo pedal's I've gotten, but I really love this one. This pedal is very easy to use! I was running my gold-top with P-90's into this pedal, then into the sparkling clean '65 twin reverb setting on my Fender Mustang II (this pedal plays well with modeling amps, which is a rarity, let me tell you) and with some tweaking I was getting a FANTASTIC Ramones tone, better than I've ever got with my Rat, my Boss DS-1, DS-2, HM-2, ANYTHING else I've owned (and I've owned over 2 dozen other dirt boxes over the years). This is the pedal that finally did it, it just nails that cranked 70's Marshall stack sound.My hat's off to Joyo. i own this pedal and the one it is cloned from. this pedal is a hot rodded marshall in  a box.it does 80's hair band and 80's metal very well.if you're looking for those sounds you will not be dissapointedif you are looking for more variety of marshall sounds and the authentic &#34;plexi&#34; or &#34;brown&#34; sound get the joyo british. To me though, it sounds too much like a pedal, and not enough like the real deal. That being said, this pedal can be cleaner than the hot plexi.BUT, if you turn the tone down, and scoop your amps mids significantly (I'm talking about 2 of 10 on the knob, where 0 of 10 is too much and gives you "Kill em all" style hollowness that isn't good), it gives a nice dark, throaty, lower-mid rich tone that would be great for metal. If you graded the pedal in a "vacuum", I could absolutely see a 5* rating for the $40 price tag.

This pedal has an EXTREMELY high output.

Ultimately, what I decided was that this pedal has enough bass, not too much in the midrange, and very distinct high end frequencies that come through very clearly.

Try comparing this pedal to a $40 Boss DS-1 or MXR Distortion + and it blows them out of the water (in my opinion).
