And for the price you really can't beat it. The price is fair for all that. For the price, its definitely worth it imho. The price was right too. For the price, keep it around rather than tracking down other wire cutters when you need to change out a set of strings. Is well worth the price and a good thing to have in your guitar case. Because of the affordable price on Amazon I will be buying some for my friends as Christmas Stocking Stuffers. for the price of this winder/cutter its awesome, if it were made with a harder plastic would have been perfect! Worth the price.
