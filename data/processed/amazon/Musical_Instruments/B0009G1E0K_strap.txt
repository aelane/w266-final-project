The strap is strong and well made. The strap is well made and suspect it will be around for some time to come. A strap is a strap, what can you really say about it? Cheap crappy strap. A nice strap for my lower tier guitars. Not fancy, but who needs a fancy strap for a $90 guitar? Best strap available for the price. Nice strap for the price. of the strap. When you remove the strap, any picks in the pocket fall out. This strap is perfect, even if you do have the money to spend and just looking for something that will do the job well.The materials are 1)high quality soft nylon for the strap - it feels kind of like a non-stretch ACE bandage, 2) durable non-scratching/marring plastic for the links and adjuster and 3) a thick rubber material for the ends.The thickness of  rubber material for the end secure the the straps pretty well. They do not slide of the strap pegs very easily. this is a nice strap. This strap is a great strap. Very good strap, but the pick pocket does not hold the picks securely. If you just need an inexpensive strap that is perfectly functional at a low price then this is the one for you. This was a great strap, i used it on my guitar for months and it's so strong that it's tough to take off, i'm buying another one for my bass Guitar will never fall off a strap. This isn't the best strap, but it's affordable and pretty good for a beginner's guitar strap. Recommended for a practical and affordable strap for electric guitar. Don't forget to buy strap locks, you will need it. I really like this strap, it's comfortable, adjusts easily, and the pick holder is really convenient. This strap is sturdy and looks good and goes well with a Fender Strat, it doesn't come off every time you get to jamming out and forget you are not sitting down, so you don't have to worry about dropping your guitar so you can focus on rocking out. This strap is very well made. The strap is very reliable, the pick pocket is a nice touch, but if playing for extended periods of times, you might want to go with something more comfortable.

If you need a simple, normal-length strap, this should work fine.

Again, not a bad strap, just not for us tall guys :)
