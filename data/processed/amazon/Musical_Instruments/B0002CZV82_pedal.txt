Frankly, I'd forgotten how musical this pedal is. But arguing over what pedal is 'best' is like two painters arguing over what color is best used to paint a sunrise. This pedal is good for a tight kind of distortion- but not so heavy that you can do modern metal if running into a clean amp - if that makes any sense. It is a professional pedal used by professional musicians. I have had this pedal for about 15 years, just replaced the old one a month ago. This pedal is a must have for any pedal board. This was the first pedal I ever bought when I started playing guitar 15 years ago. I find that if I play this pedal along with my Boss Super Chorus pedal, my guitar with Tex-Mex pickups captures a lot Gilmour's sound tonality. This pedal has been on the market for a very long time and it was a smoking deal for a Boss pedal at $40. The pedal works great with almost any guitar pickup set but sings with my EMG powered Schecter and tube amp.Different distortion levels can be dialed in and to my surprise, it works good with a bass although bass players know they will lose some bottom end.The guitar universe always raves about Boss and the distortion pedals and how any guitar player should have one of the distortion pedals. The Cool Cat Metal, or CM-1, is actually a very very different pedal from most metal pedals. Also, if you can't actually try a pedal out at the store, YouTube is great place to hear demos of what different pedals can do.I should also mention that if you try and love the DS-1 and it suits your needs, than more power to you. It is inexpensive and you can get a better pedal with barely a bit more money and sometimes a little less money. This pedal has been around for a long time, and though the overall quality has declined as Boss has cut corners to enable lower priced mass production of their pedals, the boss ds-1 remains the staple image of distortion stompbox's. Love this pedal. That pedal isn't ideal either, but if I turn the knob all the way to "distortion", it's a much better tone than I ever got out of a DS-1.Then again, it is very dependable and usually only $40 (or less), so I can't really give it a bad review because it probably does belong in everyone's collection. With this pedal, I have to crank the level to make the clean tone the same level as the distorted tone.

This pedal has a much nicer tone to it, not to mention 2 distinct distortion modes.

A very worthy pedal, unfortunately overlooked by many.Pro Co RAT2:  Great dirty distortion pedal.

That's a fine pedal as well, but its definitely more of a traditional metal pedal.
