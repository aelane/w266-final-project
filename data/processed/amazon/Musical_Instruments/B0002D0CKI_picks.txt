I got these picks a week ago and have fell in love with them. These picks are translucent purple. These  picks  R awsome! Looking for picks for bass , this one did not work for me, it is thick and hard, good attack.but only thumb picks work, so i can use my fingers too. The picks have almost zero flex to them, meaning the player has solid control. The picks were actually made from extremely sturdy material. These picks have a very unique shape and sound that have helped me play faster with a smoother tone.Unfortunately, these picks did not receive a five-star rating because of their price and lack of durability. At around $4.50 for six picks, these are some expensive pieces of plastic.However, these picks are so full of awesome that I am compelled to pay a little extra. After hearing him play with these picks, I've noticed he can play faster and more accurately with these. Most picks have high ratings, because players who like that particular type, write reviews that rate them highly. Now I only use flat picks for acoustic play when I want to hear the crunch. 24 picks in a pack, is an insane bargain.

First, I love these picks and used them exclusively for years.

I think these are great picks, but I'd like them to be made of a softer material.

So, these picks are really nice, but the picture is not what you will get.
