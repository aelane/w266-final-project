I have owned just about every tuner made. It is my tuner of choice right now. This neat little tuner has it all. There is no more forgetting my tuner or misplacing it somewhere and losing it. This little tuner does the job. This tuner has a bright backlight , a padded clip,it rotates, pivots, does flats, and  calibration from 440Hz to 438Hz. This little tuner is very precise. Being a chromatic tuner means you are not stuck just tuning EADGBE. But for now, I am very pleased with this tuner. Great chromatic tuner at a great price - I love it! Also going in there is my Intellitouch tuner, which drives me nuts with the arrows and does not fit securely on my fiddle.For my fiddle, mandolin and guitar, I'll use my just received Intelli IMT-500 which is very compact (great for fiddle/mando cases), which has an outstanding backlight, superb accuracy and quick resetting.The Intelli, in its own manufacturers box (which has no shock-absorbing material),was placed in a larger shipping box by the distributor/seller "The Instrument Store", without any shock-absorbing material, leaving the Intelli, a very sensitive electronic metering device,subject to vibration and shock during the long trip down the east coast.It would be good for Amazon to teach sellers the basics of proper packing for shipping.It's not rocket science. This is the second tuner I have bought like this. I got it because I need a second tuner. It also appears that the tuner wasn't reliable on the pitch end either. Recently ordered the red SNARK tuner here on Amazon, and I think it's much better- the Intelli does have the fact that it folds down snug against my guitar going for it- the snark is a little more bulky.Ultimately, the most important thing for me when it comes to tuners is accurate pitch, and readability- Snark wins out... this tuner works for sure, but I don't think it's the best out there.The Snark is cheaper too!

The Intelli IMT-500--The tuner that killed the Intellitouch!There are scores of chromatic tuners on the market.

The entire tuner clipped onto the instrument.

I only have used this tuner on classical guitars (the ones with nylon strings).
