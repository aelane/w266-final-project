Your used to using big picks, which strum hard easily. Cannot recall how these picks are with my acoustic, as I've been on an electric fixation lately.Also a fan of the regular Jazz IIIs and find they don't slip as much as my Dunlop Tortex picks. Both picks have their own unique tonal character.I've tried a variety of picks and I think that once you get used to smaller picks, you will find the larger styles feel clumsy and awkward. I have also since found that while these are fantastic picks, I actually prefer theDunlop Jazz III Pick Pack, Red Nylon,1.38mmdespite lack of the Max-Grip raised lettering. They are just the most wonderful picks I've used. These picks are really hard and last forever. I have tried many picks in my 25+ years of guitar playing and this one is by far the best. I never seen picks that wouldn't do these things, however I really struggled with these things that seem so easy with other picks. These picks are a good change of pace. These picks are fantastic, but smaller then picks I've used in the past, but easy to hold onto due to the shape and texture, very durable, believe these are smaller for Jazz use. It's really small--noticeably smaller than the red Jazz III picks. These picks are nice but just  too small. I do like these picks too. These picks are smaller than a regular guitar pick and they are thick. These picks have a great grip, though, and feel dry and gritty even when they're clean as a bone.

I tend to drop picks and have tried numerous brands and types of picks, but for ease of grip these are hard to beat.

I recommend these picks without reservation.

These picks sound great, very durable and grip is the best I have used.
