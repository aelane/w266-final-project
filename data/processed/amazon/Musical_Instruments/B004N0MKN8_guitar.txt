When your guitar isn't in it is prone to being hit and launching picks everywhere. The guitar rest simply makes your guitar more accessible, and that means... you're more apt to grab your axe and play more.When un-weighted by the guitar neck, the Rest itself is rather light and can move around easily. It is also good to have when I am using Garage Band, and need to set the guitar down for a second. it doesn't fall when there's a guitar, but I think I'll use some tape or sticky gunk to help hold in place while it's lying in wait. As long as the guitar is on it works great. This can work, but if you already use a guitar stand then it is a waste of money. It will work if you use your guitar next to the a table. I think this guitar rest is pretty nice. There is also one available that looks like a guitar.

I keep one with my guitar and one at home and never had a fall.

Its small enough to keep in my guitar case and cheap enough to replace if it gets lost.

it is ok as long as you don't bump your guitar, else boom, it hits the floor.
