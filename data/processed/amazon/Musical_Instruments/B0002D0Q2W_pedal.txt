First, this pedal is dirt cheap, but the build quality actually seems very solid. This pedal would also be good for a solo boost, as it has plenty of output to make your leads punch through.Overall, for this price, you can't go wrong. I don't think I need to run this pedal with every amp I own but it does a great job 'opening up the sound' of boxy or dark sounding amps. I wasn't expecting much from this pedal but it has been a pleasant surprise. The pedal is quiet and solidly built. This is a basic EQ pedal, that is a bit noisy in my testing. I needed an EQ pedal since my current amp has no way of adjusting it's EQ. I really didn't expect much since this pedal was so cheap; and for a brand new one at that; I was completely surprised that this worked and also helped improve the overall sound by fiddling with each band adding a nice richness to the overall mids. I bought this EQ pedal to use with a 70's amp project. I do not gig with the pedal so the plastic doesn't matter to me. I also tried the EQ with a Telecaster and the pedal gave me alot more bass and low end. This pedal, fish and chips, which i find it to taste nothing like, works nicely.And was pretty cheap..I've heard some complaints/worries about the flimsiness of the plastic.As of 03.13 the plastic seems pretty thick/durable.The switch does seem of a poor quality, but if it did break im sure either send it in and get a new one or put a nicer switch in yourself.As for noise, It doesn't seem to add much, unless you have the gain switch at the end turned up high, and with distortion and what have you.I haven't gotten to blast (play bedroom level, technically) since i've gotten it, but it sounds good through the headphones.I'm using a squire strat, fryette sas distortion, now the fish and chips, boss me-50 all running into, for now, my vox vt20+, which is outputting to my headphones.

Seriously, this is a great pedal.

I use this pedal behind my dirt pedals for added flexibility and bringing out some more "brilliance" to the tone.
