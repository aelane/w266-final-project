This pedal adds the same kind of sparkle to your sound that you would get from using a clean boost on a tube amp. It's a pedal that I would leave on all the time once my tone is dialed in. This is a great pedal to put at the end of your FX chain. This is a good pedal for end of line tone adjustments. This pedal won't make a cheap 15 watt solid- state combo sound like a tube half-stack. This is a pedal that I leave on all the time, as it improves both clean and distorted tones. This pedal adds that "I don't know what" to your sound.I chased a sound for years until buying this pedal - what a difference.If you have great, top quality cable, quiet amps and pedal boards, shielded guitars, fresh tubes - you know the drill - you spend thousands chasing something you hear in your head - then you plug one pedal in and WHAMO!! - there it is!It was THIS pedal for me - just turn the knobs until "it" comes out of your speakers.A must have - especially if you are playing clubs, bars or arenas - you have a pedal board - and you are looking for that sound that is gonna finally push your sound out front - give your notes clarity during leads - make overdriven chords ring.I like this pedal - it's on my board - and it's never coming off. This pedal is very subtle, but to an audiophile like me it is absolutely essential. IMO, the pedal is really only for those folks who have no effects loop but still like what the BBE does.

This pedal does a great job of giving your instrument a more balanced and full tone.

I highly recomend this pedal for and and all musicians.

Essentially, this pedal allows you to get the most out of the tones your amp is already producing.The lo contour knob doesn't "increase" the amount of bass produced by the amp.
