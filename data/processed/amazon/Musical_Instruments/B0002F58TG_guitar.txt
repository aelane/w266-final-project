And I keep the guitar sitting on an "on stage xcg4" guitar stand. I can tune my guitar for free from using the program on garageband (a music recording program that comes on mac computers) and on garageband there is also a great guitar tutorial video lesson series which has been helpful. And inside that was my lovely new guitar. I bought this guitar about 2 years ago and I have played tons of different acoustic guitars from Taylor to Fender and more. This is by far the nicest acoustic guitar I have played. Additionally, this is my favorite guitar and I would recommend this guitar to anyone wanting to play acoustic. This guitar could very easily pass as one of the 1000 dollar guitars. The guitar has no finish which I prefer because when you are done playing your guitar is not covered with oil smears from your hands. I love Takamine for producing such a beautiful guitar at such a great value. This guitar will last forever because it was made so nice. THIS guitar is wonderful and sounds great. Even though it is only an $89 guitar, I will treasure this one as if it was $300. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. This is a great guitar for the money. I paid $69.34 for my guitar and bought it through Amazon.com from Streamline Audio Video. If you want a better guitar than this, you will need to spend a whole lot more. Otherwise you'll have to pay a guitar shop to do a proper setup. She is learning to play guitar and the classical guitar I gave her was just too wide for her little fingers to reach. If you are looking at this guitar, buy it! I recived this guitar today(2/8/13)and its perfect. This guitar is amazing!
