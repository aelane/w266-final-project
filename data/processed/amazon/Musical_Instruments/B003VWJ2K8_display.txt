It actually just dims the display as the battery is dying, and can last like that for months. It is easy to operate, has a nice large display that you can easily see and it's small enough to carry anywhere. The display is easy to read and easier to use. The display is very easy to read...better than the GoGo (although GoGo has a new improved display since I bought mine). Bright, easy to read display. Works great and love the colorful display. The display is bright and easy to read, and the graph has a lot of resolution. It also has an excellent display for showing you how sharp or flat you are. Bright easy to read display, adjusts to face any direction, so I can even use it with my Telecaster which has very little room on the headstock. The display is bright and the interface is very intuitive...you just press the button and start plucking strings.In addition, Snark's customer service was very friendly and helpful.Putting my two cents aside(that anyone who plays the guitar should learn to tune by sound, without a tuner, given one of the notes), I highly recommend the Snark tuner. The display is good, and the tuners work well. the display is bright and easy to see and he loves it.

The display is colorful and easy to read and hides neatly behind the headstock.

Accurate, easy to use, clear display, and much smaller than I anticipated, yet it's quite sturdy and attaches snugly to my guitar.

The display is easy to understand and is very accurate (confirmed by our guitar teacher's meter).
