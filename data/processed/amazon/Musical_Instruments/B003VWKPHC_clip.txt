It is better than most other clip on tuners though and the battery lasts longer too. Very nice clip on tuner for the price.I actually got this as a gift for a friend and they seem to really like it. (Where the clip attaches to the tuner - as in a multitude of other reviews...)This tuner *is* amazing... Recently I purchased and reviewed the new GoGo TT-1 clip on tuner. I never thought a clip on could be as accurate and dependable as my Boss. Just clip it on to your guitar head, and hit the string. All Snarks clip on the headstock and use vibrations there to activate the tuner. I have other, more expensive clip on tuners, but the Snark is by far my favorite. This is the second clip on tuner I have bought.

They are basically made of a clip that attaches to your instrument, a round frisbee shaped tuner, and an arm that connects the two.

It does, however, clip into the sound hole okay.It tunes the harp fairly well.

Just clip it on and ta-da!
