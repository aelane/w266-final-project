I really like these strings. While they are not quite as bright sounding as uncoated strings, they still sound better than many other strings, AND they last so much longer. They're clearly good strings, and I love the way they play and feel on my fingertips, but I can't get past the sound. It could just be about how the strings sound on my particular guitars, but in any case, I'm not happy with the sound and that's why I have a hard time giving them a solid five-star rating.I tried these on two separate guitars I play regularly, and wasn't terribly impressed with the sound on either. These strings softened the tone, which I wasn't looking to do. These strings made the guitar even more quiet, and there was a considerable drop-off in tone quality as well. They might have been cheap, old strings, because I couldn't tell that there was anything special about them. I like strings to either sound as good as other strings, or improve the tone and pull more from the guitar. These strings did neither for me. I've been thinking about trying the Nanoweb strings for a while, but I was a bit put off by the high price (they cost about twice as much as the uncharted strings I've been buying)  and the comments of some reviewers that the tone of coated strings is noticeably duller. If I didn't know that they were coated strings I certainly wouldn't be able to tell from playing them. You're probably breaking strings or losing them to metal fatigue long before they'd go dull from corrosion or contamination. I have tried coated strings in the past ( including Elixirs) and have never been very fond of them. I still don't like them as much as regular strings but because of the type of gigs I mostly do these seem to be a reasonable trade off. Well, MADE by Elixir and DEVELOPED with Taylor Guitars ... these strings were designed for the new 800 (Rosewood) series guitars that came out this year (2014) ... the promise is a &#34;bolder high end, fuller low end&#34; ... I am not sure how these strings will perform on guitars other than Taylor's but what anyone should notice is more volume and clarity from the treble strings ... that is what I notice most from the HD's compared to the regular ... These strings are really quite good, but I wouldn't call them perfect. The unwound strings are not quite as bright as I am accustomed to, but they still ring nicely. If the unwound strings were a tiny bit brighter, these would be 5-star strings.

I put these strings on my Guild acoustic electric.

I had used Elixer strings for several years on both 6 and 12 string guitars.

These are great strings, worth the money, and sound great.
