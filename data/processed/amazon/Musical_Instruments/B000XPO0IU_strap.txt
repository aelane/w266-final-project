Wonderful and inexpensive strap. This strap feels pretty good and feels like it would be more durable than the cheaper stuff. Very comfortable strap. This is a perfect strap for my guitar. This strap works fine for that. That being said, the strap is fairly soft and pliable, with that almost broken in feel. I suppose I could have unscrewed my strap locks to facilitate mounting the strap, but I didn't.The range of fit seems pretty good to me. Other than that the strap is of good quality.

I ended up using the strap on my Strat for the acoustic and this one is on the Strat.

This strap is strong and sturdy.

Even without strap locks I'm comfortable going crazy on stage.
