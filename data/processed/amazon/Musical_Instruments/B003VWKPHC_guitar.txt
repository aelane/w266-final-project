They still tune, but I have to hold them against the guitar. This attached to basically any guitar, or almost any object for that matter. I am a new guitar player, and this item has helped me greatly in quickly tuning my guitar. She has been using my guitar tuner which works okay but cumbersome. I will be buying one for every guitar case I own. I purchased this to use with my old Yamaha acoustic guitar and my ukelele. I had used one of these at a guitar shop once while shopping for a new acoustic/electric. I like leaving it on the guitar while practicing to just make minor adjustments if there's a drop-D song, or just tweak something that goes out of tune.Does exactly what it is supposed to do, and it stays out of the way. Maybe I should just change the guitar pitch to my off-pitch singing and I could finally achieve perfect harmony! It does what a guitar tuner should do.It simply clips onto the headstock of the guitar and easily shows you where your string is in reference to standard tuning.I do have an equally good tuner by monoprice that's about half price. I buy these and put one in each of my guitar cases. They also work well with acoustical guitar. Works well on my acoustic guitar and acoustic bass. It works for guitar and bass. I keep them clipped to each of my guitar heads so they are always ready if I need a quick tuning to that guitar...Good quality, accurate and not expensive...Highly recommended and 5 Stars. I teach classical guitar and have found this tuner to be one I go to the most, and I have a lot of different tuners. I leave it on my guitar all the time. I have several guitar and ukulele chromatic tuners. I use the Snark for both ukulele and accoustic guitar. I own 5 or 6 of them, one for each guitar, and I highly recommend them over ANYTHING else. Great for guitar, fiddle, mandolin, dobro, and other instruments that it can clamp to. My young guitar students struggled with other tuners but not this one. Correctly tuned this VERY OLD guitar for the first time in YEARS! She opened it up, got curious and tried it out on her guitar that prolly hasn't been in tune since...

It is bright, easy to attach to my guitar but there are some problems with it being so "fragile" at the base.

Looks ok on your guitar and it is not in the way.

They thought the guitar was fine before the tuner.
