These are super strings. It was used, and the strings were dismal sounding, so I bought these D'Addario EXLs. Having used heavier strings forever on my acoustic guitars, the recommended lighter gauge recommended for the electric don't like my "heavy-handed" approach to pressing down the strings. It will take some getting used to -- or else I'll simply move to heavier strings and leave the lighter ones to lead guitarists who know what they are doing. All of that said, the strings are pure joy to play. I have started to use lighter strings to keep the neck from getting fatigued. ...strings I use D'Addario strings on my acoustic and electric guitars as well they are great. So these are  pretty great strings.

I like that these strings come with a code that allows you to determine whether they are authentic or counterfeit.
