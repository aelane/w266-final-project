This pedal lives up to the hype. I have owned the Fulltone OCD in the past and this pedal is nearly identical sounding if my memory serves me correctly. The pedal also plays well with others-  I am getting nice lead tones by running a TS type of OD into the front of this one. The Joyo Ultimate Overdrive is simply a great pedal. I can clearly see why so many have stated that this pedal is so good. This pedal is currently plugged in, and I suspect that I'll keep it as part of my rig (unless I happen to get rich and find a nicer, boutique pedal, or get around to modding my other pedals. this is a great pedal I would suggest it to anyone looking to get a pedal that would do overdrive and distortion it is a little more on the gain side and has a fizzy characteristic not to fuzzy however imo. I needed a small pedal board and didnt want to put a lot of money into pedals so I gave the Joyo pedals a try and I am pleasently surprised. This is a pretty hot pedal! I did not think a pedal under 40 bucks could sound this good. A pedal does not make you play better, practice does. I do not own the Fulltone pedal that this product was designed to replicate, but you can search YouTube and see several comparisons and there is no audible difference. Aside from that, this pedal is quite awesome on its own merit. Many have decribed this pedal and there is nothing else like it at this price point! good pedal to add.

All you need to know is that this pedal is well-constructed and sounds darn good for 40 dollars.Joyo is a Chinese company that essentially has makes their own form factor (a heavy-duty metal box with an MXR-like button switcher), and then clones/mimics/copies circuitry of popular boutique pedals that cost anywhere from $100 to $250.

This pedal got some notoriety a few years back when an American company bought them in bulk, repainted them, and tried to sell them for almost $200.

I own that pedal, and I've done a side by side comparison on my pedal board.
