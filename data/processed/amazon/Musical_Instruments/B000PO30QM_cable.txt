I use this cable a lot, and it has stood the test of time. Great cable! This cable is quality, no crackling, strong connections and hard metal. I like this cable for it has an angled plug. Not too much to say about a cable. I was initially concerned when I first received the cable that it would not last. The cable is not as fat as I had hoped, however the ends are solid and sturdily built. This Hosa Cable is a very good cable and I even chose to use Hosa jumper cables between my over drives and effects pedals. The cable itself is thinker that ordinary guitar cable. If you need a well made cable in a short length, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend these. This cable is perfect for a kid who is going to his/her guitar lesson and has to plug in.I bought two of these for the home studio to jack in a guitar with a pedal or two in between. This cable seems top-notch to me. This a great cable, the length is perfect for practice, and I'd buy another. Quality cable, sturdy  user serviceable connectors, well constructed, and 6 months of daily use with no issues. I bought this cable, because my guitar connection is in the back. Glad I chose to purchase this cable. I will use this cable to connect my guitars to a portable amp. This is a great cable at a good price. This cable works for me in the tuner out jack of my amp. I noticed how thin the cable is, but the length is good for my needs. I  have played through the cable once and found it sub par compared to my other cables, which are professional grade and cost a lot more, but this is a cheap cable and sounds like any other cable of this caliber. I use this cable between my fender blues jr and a ditto x2 looper, it works great and the angled jack puts less stress on the cable and input jack The cable shipped fast, and I couldn't be more pleased. This little cable gets used on my practice amp. This is actually my best cable and I think I will soon be upgrading my cheaper cables to these

The shorter the cable, the better for studio use.

If you need a longer cable, buy a longer cable.

Don't buy what is advertised as 5' cable and then write a negative review when you really needed a 15' cable.
