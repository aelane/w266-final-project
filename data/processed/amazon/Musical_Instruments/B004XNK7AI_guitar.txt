Got this to tune my guitar without relying on Rocksmith on my PS3, and to double check against it. I have several of these for my guitar, fiddle, and mandolin. If it can tune that, it should handle your guitar or bass FINE. It has already pulled up and I only put it on and off my guitar maybe 3 times so far. I am my own guitar tech, as well as for a friend, and I can set the intonation perfectly with this thing.Get a Snark and you will be happy.Edit - I don't like to use this with my PRS as the headstock has very little room to clip this to. While adequate, I wanted the Snark because it was made specifically for guitar and the clip-on feature would counter my laziness in finding the tuner.The snark is great, and the price is amazing. You will know exactly how sharp or flat the guitar is or if you want to try alternative tunings like drop-D it is so much simpler than with the Korg.No metronome but that's what I'm keeping the Korg for. I have many young guitar students and the Snark is the first tuner they have no trouble using. I've been playing guitar for over 25 years and been through many different style of tuners. I can actually tune my guitar while having a conversation, even with the TV on in the room!Pro's:- Vibrant , easy to read display- No need for cords, chargers even when used on electric guitars/bass.- Simple one button activation- Lightweight - I leave it on my classical guitar all the time, especially after restringing.- Auto Shutoff (also can manually shut it off, just press the one button a second time)- Works for Guitar and Bass (both acoustic and electric) and violin - Also works on my Ukulele!Con's:Wish I had this 20 years ago!Bottom Line:This is a no-brainer.

I decided to adjust my guitar intonation with the Snark (no one would ever do this...this was a test) and it was very close to my stroboscope.

These are cheap enough to buy one for each guitar so I don't have to move it around as I change guitars during performances.

It's fine for guitar or banjo
