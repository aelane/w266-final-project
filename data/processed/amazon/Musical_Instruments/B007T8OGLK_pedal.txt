The Joyo pedal looks kool and has some kool features but those are the main pros. If you go this pedal and didnt have a noise suppresser you'd be up the creek. Although it is a fuzz pedal is it does "fuzz" things then that's why I give it 4 stars. Joyo I like your other pedal but this one makes me want to punch your entire company in the mouth. To me this pedal is pretty nice but sounds a bit compressed. Don't get me wrong, it's a pretty cool pedal but it's not as nice to my ears as my other two fuzz pedals. This is probably my least favorite Joyo pedal. But darn it, this is one amazingly nice pedal when I consider price. This pedal provides the classic octave distortion I sought after. Having said all that I could see this pedal really shining with a punk sound where bar chords are in abundance. I've used this pedal to put some growl in my bass, kind of an E.H. Bass Balls sound. Every pedal that I buy of joyo amaze me.

This pedal creates fuzz and can raise a note an octave.
