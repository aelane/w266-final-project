It is easy to use, easy to put on, easy to adjust the tension, and lightweight. It has adjustable tension and it fits on the neck in a different manner. I backed off the tension as much as possible, set it on the neck, made one adjustment and it was perfect. Since I can adjust the tension, I have no worries about it pulling strings sharp.I only wish it was a bit shorter for Ukulele neck widths! It has an ingenious but simple tension adjustment knob. Once adjusted, though, the downward tension on the strings seems to work well with no fret buzz. I like the adjustable tension of this capo, I don't think its as easy to put on a "Kyser" capo of this style, but once on the neck, the Planet Waves NS Tri-Action Capo moves easily, and has even pressure across the fingerboard, a result of the adjustable tension I surmise. I also appreciate the even tension across the strings. But at the maximum tension, this capo has a stronger grip than the Kyser, which makes for a buzz-free playing experience.---The Planet Waves Capo definitely gives the Kyser a run for its money. The adjustable tension is a great idea and the open/close lever is designed in such a way that it sits behind the guitar neck and won't get in the way of your hands (unlike the capo I had before this one). Initially, the Planet Waves' Capo required me to play around with the tension and placement on my instrument which caused me some concern at first.

However, because of the adjustable tension, you do need to adjust it when moving to a different neck thickness.

There was ample tension E-G but B and E were buzzy as all get out.

Not expecting much, I adjusted the tension.
