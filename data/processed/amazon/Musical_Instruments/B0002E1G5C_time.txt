It works as it should and saves time. Next time I place an order, I'm going to get another one as a spare. It is very solid and will last a long time. It cuts your changing time down drastically. This was the first time I've ever used a string winder and cutter. Huge time saver and works as promised. It saves time when restringing a guitar. great little time saver with all that is needed to restring in one compact device..It works well, pretty good buy.
