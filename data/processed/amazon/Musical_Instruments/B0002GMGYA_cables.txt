If you need cables, these work great. I have more expensive cables but rather use these. These cables are just what I hoped they would be. Simply, these are great cables. Once I switched to these cables I never use anything else now. Even if you insist on using the more expensive cables, this is a great one to have as a spare. I own several of these cables in various lengths and am very pleased with the quality and performance of them. not stiff or difficult to work with like some other cables tend to be.And a lifetime warranty on the cables is a great addition at this price. More durable than the cheap cables you find online and less expensive than the 'boutique' cables.. Great working-man's gear.
