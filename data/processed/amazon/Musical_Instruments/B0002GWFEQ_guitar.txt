I buy one of these for each guitar. good if you dont want to have to drill your guitar for a stud mount. My new guitar had only the back strap connector.You can put out over $20 for a button strap holder but for under 5 bucks I decided on this.Attach short end to strap feed long end under strings on guitar head.You now have a quick release strap holder.Very well made & strong! I t holds your guitar very securely and does lease the guitar at the neck extremely fast, so y don't have to life it over your head. I bought this for an accousic guitar, then I had to have one for a mandolin, and now I also have one for a square-neck dobro. Some accoustic guitar manufacturers cases that come with the guitar don't leave much room for a leather strap. I have acoutic guitar that never felt comfortable to me. It makes it very easy to attach or detach your guitar strap to/from the headstock of your guitar or ukulele or other stringed instrument.

I just put it on my Baby Taylor guitar strap.

I was pleasantly surprised with this "Guitar Quick Release System" is working good with my acoustic guitar.

And because of that I did purchase 2 more for my other guitar and for my friend one.
