Cool tuner, I have this on my pedal board and it works really well, very easy to seeand is true bypass which is nice when it isn't on.... This is a great little tuner for guitar. Wow, I'm really impressed with this tuner. This tuner is wonderful. I like the tuner and I'm definitely keeping it, but the "polyphonic" aspect of it is pretty useless. But the tuner works great in the single string mode, and I also like the drop D setting and the easy way to switch between the 2 modes. The tuner works great, and that is its saving grace after a kinda gimmicky sales pitch regarding the polyphonic setting. So I set the tuner to the E flat setting as explained in the manual, then I tried to tune.

So while this tuner is great if you want something that looks nice and doesn't take up space on the pedal board, stock it just wasn't a truly great tuner.However, that was before a firmware update.

So now you have a small, attractive tuner w/ true bypass that actually works.

It's not a bad tuner, seems well built but unless you play so poorly or loud that tuning precision doesn't matter I'd go with the Korg Pitch Black (which is what I was using in my home studio - well back to what worked!)
