This strap replaces another one just like it which I use with an acoustic guitar for giving lessons. But this strap works okay with it. I have a Taylor 710ce and this strap had to be forced over the top connection near the neck of the guitar. Good basic strap. The strap lock was well thought out and seems to have no weak spots. get strap for the price, does what it is supposed to do and is comfortable too. (you really can't ask more than that from a strap) it feels fine,and if you have a bedazzler you can write your name on it...me, not so much,i'll just leave it hang!! I bought this strap for a ESP EC-1000 Les Paul style guitar. When I got the strap I was impressed. Good strap for sitting down or playing standing short gigs with a light guitar. Bought this strap for my acoustic guitar however the neck button was to close to the neck for the wide locking device at the end of the strap. Nicely made and works well to retain strap to guitar. Pretty basic strap, but durable and works for me. If you want a strap for $5 you can't expect the moon. This strap seemed a little awkward at first, but after a rigorous six month evaluation it's become my go-to strap.I currently have it locked to a Fender Strat and experience NO problems with the strap ends rubbing against the body of the guitar. Although the strap ends are light plastic, they've held up well. I wasn't all that happy with this strap connected to a Les Paul. This strap is not a bad one, but it just did not fit my guitar, so that is the only problem. It's a strap. It costs $5 or less delivered...what more could you ask for in a strap??? And I certainly wouldn't keep this strap on a guitar when it's going to be carried in a gig bag. its not the best strap but, for what i paid for it, its well worth it. This is not my first Planet Waves locking strap. The strap had a small stain.

The strap itself is plain, but it highlights the beauty of my guitar.

I have an acoustic-electric Ibanez but the strap wouldn't fit, however the strap wasn't purchased for the acoustic - I was just trying it on all of my different guitars for reviewers sake.If you're considering buying this, just do it.

This strap is perfect for those needs.
