CRAP these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bends unless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy Ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of Ernies I didn't even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right....................never again These are great strings! These strings are okay, but nothing special except for the price, which is a factor when changing twice a week. This doesn't mean that these strings are bad, it just means I might prefer Brand X Pure Nickel on one guitar because they're darker and Brand Y Steels on another because they're brighter and Brand Z on yet another.So give these a try and if you prefer them it will be best to check on price by the case of this or any string that you prefer because they should be changed twice a month at least, if you want your instrument in top shape.

Sadly, these D'Addario strings are really only good for about one or two weeks of playing.I've tried a variety of strings, Ernie Ball, Elixir, and D'Addario, on my guitars and the way I play, the Elixir's just sound and play the best to me. The strings come in a cardstock outer box, with a single plastic package inside.

I bought these strings at a local shop for a Fender Telecaster on reccomendation from the guitar tech.

Their strings are of uniformly high quality and excellent consistency, the price is right, they're color coded to make string changing easier, and they come in an air tight plastic package that keeps them from corroding even after sitting in a guitar case or a year or more.
