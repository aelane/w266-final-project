I own HUNDREDS of picks. You can't go wrong with these picks if you enjoy a full size pick. They are still usable as decent picks. However, now Im playing my Godin 5th Ave and suddenly these picks are perfect. Ive gone back and forth trying different picks with my guitars. These picks were no different from picks without the &#34;gator grip&#34; IMHO. If I were perfectly satisfied with these picks I would never buy any other picks. For now these are my preferred picks but I will keep experimenting with other brands and types of picks in search of that elusive ideal.

My favorite picks for the last ~8 years are Snarling Dogs Brain Picks - they're nylon picks that have a raspy "cat's tongue" surface that makes it super easy to grip.I've also had a few of these Gator Grip picks for a few years now and I like them quite a bit, but they're not my favorite.

These picks have a matte finish which makes it easy to retain your grip on them.

I've been using the Dunlop Delrin 500 2.0 picks.
