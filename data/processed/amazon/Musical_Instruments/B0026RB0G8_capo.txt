This capo will do the job, if you can squeeze it open. This capo works fine, its strong and fits great on my Spanish or Steel string guitar, I wouldn't ask for something more I received this capo yesterday and it works perfectly on my acoustic guitar. I chose this capo because I was just starting out and needed one for certain songs. This was a cheap capo, but it does its job well. Some say "this capo work bad" I have to ask "are your guitar is good enough to use this capo?" or "are you know how to use capo? This capo is worth the price.

This is a really strong capo.

This capo will not work on a guitar with a thicker neck, for example a les paul or most acoustics.

I bought this to have a capo I could just leave clipped on my acoustic's head for use when needed.
