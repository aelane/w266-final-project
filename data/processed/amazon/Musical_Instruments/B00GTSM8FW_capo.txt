The G7 capo goes with my Takamine New Yorker, and this Planet Waves goes on everything else. I had considered anther capo which came with a tuner for certain applications. The capo itdelf id wuite capable as it is a spring attached capo with a micro adjustment screw/spring which can be helpful with guitars that go sharp when a capo is employed. If you're looking to buy a capo i'd recommend this over a Kyser. Regardless of capo tension you should position it as close to the fret as practical and, unless you're avoiding playing that first fret (or use a low-thumb classical fret hand position) you're always going to feel some part of the capo against the leading edge of your hand. The older Planet Waves capo is still available so it comes down to preference.To top off the confusion, the picture on the front of the cardboard card the NS Artist comes mounted on shows a similar capo positioned in a way that's impossible with this capo! All in all...not a bad capo. I don't particularly care for this capo and will likely not use it for much stuff. I'll stick to my other NS Planet Waves capo or my old faithful Kyser. I hardly ever use a capo, but if I need one, I am glad to have this one. The Artist capo also has an adapter that allows The player to attach one of those small clip-on tuners directly too  the capo. Assuming that you don't use the capo constantly, why would you want to clip the tuner to the capo instead of to the guitar's headstock? I can play right up to the capo without my left hand hitting anything on the underside of the neck.I really like that fact that it's adjustable, and this feature comes in really handy when moving it from guitar to the tenor banjo or mandolin. This also lets you move the capo further behind the fret so it's even less in the way of your hand, a very useful feature which most other one-hand capos can't offer.It's an easy on-in-seconds design that is as slim and simple as it gets. The capo also has a little pick slot, which will comfortably take up to about a .73 mm pick. The capo has a slight curve that works well on any curved neck. While the capo's grip is good, it still needs to be fitted right behind the fret. This is the best capo we have (out of three). The capo is pretty good. Planet Waves NS Artist Capo is as near perfect a capo that I've ever come across.

So most capo's work with 10's and on up because there is a lot more tension on the strings.

When using this capo put it closer to the fret, rather than in the middle between two frets.

The capo has a micro-adjusting knob, but it is into as consistent with acoustic guitars, such as my Seagull that have non-standard width fretboards.
