I can crank the amp or keep it quiet, and there is no tone changes done to my effects. This amp puts out a wall of clean sounds that can put you down!My Vox may be a better recording amp, but this is a better gigging amp every day of the year. Moreover, the amp is loud if you choose to make it so, and even at high-gain settings it has ample headroom.If you want distortion, this is probably not the amp for you. This amp has tons of power to spare. Remember, this amp is NOT for metal. All in all this amp was a good buy and I recommend it to anyone in the market for a solid state amp in this price range....But this wouldn't be a very good review without having some cons. With another amp sitting on top of my Frontman 212r, the power switch is even harder to get to.EFFECTS LOOP IS ON THE FRONT?-The last thing I want to see on or around my rig is messy wires everywhere. I know because when I first got this amp I went to pick it up and I immediately stopped myself because I could feel it about to break.---BOTTOM LINE---BUY if...-This is the best amp you can afford-This matches the sound your after-You need the 100 Watts to be loud enough for a drumset-You want the Fender name and sound without the huge price-tag.DONT BUY if...-You play metal/hard rock-This is your first amp-You only plan on playing at bedroom levels-You can afford a tube amp

If you fingerpick, this is your amp.

This is the amp!But, if you follow the darker side, keep looking...

Exceptionally clean, and the amp provides controls to allow you to contour your sound, which helps significantly when running keyboards through it.
