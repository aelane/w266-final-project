He loves it and now has an electric guitar and wants another stand. yes this is a great guitar stand nice cushion has a lock strap I'm very happy don't mind standing my les Paul custom pro guitar in this baby This is great if you have to put your guitar down but don't want to put it in its case. Once I got it put together, and placed my beloved guitar in the thing, I got happier. It looks nice and holds the guitar safely (padding protects the guitar finish). Seriously, the tubular guitar stand has been around since dirt. It holds your guitar up. This is my first guitar stand and I have to say I am pretty happy with it. This is a no-nonsense cheap guitar stand. This is perfect for your Fender Starcaster or screaming pink Hello Kitty guitar. I picked up another one of these for a new guitar and I'm very impressed. But it keeps my guitar handy and does the job I wanted it to do at a low price. I'd recommend easing your guitar into place and making sure it's secure. If you just want a basic guitar stand to keep your guitar safe whilst at home. most guitar shapes and sizes fit on this guitar stand,it is easy to assemble and theres really not much to it but the fact that its a guitar stand,nothing special about it.

I really like this guitar stand, it was worth the extra money.

It securely holds my acoustic guitar and leans back a bit so you can clearly see it.

Bad because if you just toss your guitar onto it the way I do, sometimes it just swings around annoyingly.
