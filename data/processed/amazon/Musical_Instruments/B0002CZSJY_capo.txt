It's a capo... nice fit... yet, sometimes I wonder if it fits too tightly, as when I use it, and of course the strings are tighter, sometimes I feel that playing with this particular capo makes my strings too tight...yet, it is a capo, structured very well. I wanted a capo that was simple to operate and wasn't too expensive - and the Kyser Quick Change Guitar Capo fits the bill nicely:[Update 7/25/10: My Orlando guitar was stolen. [Update 7/25/10] I've had this capo for almost 3 years and it's still working like a champ! It's the same capo Colbie Caillat used inBubbly!---The Kyser Quick Change Guitar Capo is excellent! Easy to use capo. I use the capo for my guitar and it sounds awesome. I like to put the capo on the first fret and when I play a song I made, it sounds really really good. The capo is very easy to use as well. I really like my capo, the blue looks good with my light natural finish accoustic, and it works as it should. This is the best capo around and works great. The capo itself is really good. This capo is awesome, it looks and feels very nice and premium, it works on all of my guitars not much more you can ask for.
