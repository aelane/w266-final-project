This is a fine guitar, but it isn't amazing. My guitar also has a weird V shape on the back of the neck where the wood grain doesn't match at all - I'm guessing that it's a joint that has been glued together. The guitar is too small for me to comfortably play it without a strap, even while sitting. It's great that this guitar has all the knobs and switches that &#34;real&#34; Les Paul guitars do, but from a practical standpoint it is rather cumbersome to have separate volume and tone knobs for each pickup. Though this is a fine guitar for the price, I'm not sure that I would make the same choice if I were in the same position again. I have been playing guitar for over 30 years. I cannot begin to tell you how much I love this guitar. It is a solid, well built guitar. I would perform live with this guitar in a heartbeat. You cannot find a better guitar for this price. I am extremely impressed with this great guitar. You can bet, when I add the next guitar to my collection, it will be another epiphone. I'm sure this can be easily fixed by any guitar tech and it will continue been the sweet-tone machine it has always been. This guitar is extremely well made and put together right. This is one awesome guitar! I am very happy with the guitar. Anyway it all worked out as the guitar is very easy to play, free prime two day shipping, no sales tax, and saved about $80 in gas it would have taken to make a trip to buy one in a store.

A guitar tech told me it's the best guitar out there under $500.

I have been playing guitar since I was 6 years old (over 3 decades) and I must say this was a very pleasant surprise.

This guitar has a very sloid feel, and came set-up perfectly right out of the box.
