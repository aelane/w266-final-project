This is a really nice strap. My second favorite strap is one just like this except without the grommets. Excellent strap. this guitars strap can work in any guitar, from a really light  guitar as a bird of prey to a  heavy Warlock NT Besides it being uncomfortable at first, it's an awesome strap and I would recommend it to anyone that has a guitar :) This is a sturdy strap with a nice pattern and double-leather ends. The BC Rich has both of its strap mount points on the rear of the guitar, so when I adjusted the length to a comfortable position, the adjustment buckle is now on my neck and shoulder rather than on my back. as I said on my last Dunlop strap reviewI love the Dunlop Guitar straps not expensive strong and sturdy just a great product I have 4 or 5 of them.when I buy a guitar I buy a Dunlop strap and Strap locks always to protect my investment.

This is a really nice, thick strap.

It is a very comfy strap and prolly wouldn't break if you had a knife to it.

It's the best strap money can buy.
