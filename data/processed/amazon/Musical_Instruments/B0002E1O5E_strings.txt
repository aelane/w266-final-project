Elixir strings are my favorite choice of strings for all 8 of my Guitars. Good strings for my electric guitar.I liked the product a lotClean sound, easy to change and much more. Elixir strings are very nice. Totally awesome strings. I've heard other strings are great too, but I highly recommend everyone try these if you haven't. I'd pay double for these strings all day. I would usually replace my strings every month, but I've started leaving them on for up to 6 months. These guitar strings are very nice and I love them.

So much for Magic Elixir Tone.Don't get me wrong, I really do want to love these, as I hate changing strings, but geez guys, how about some quality control?If I'm going to pay triple the price, then is it crazy to expect triple the quality?

So that's four broken strings in less than 20 hours' play.

I liked my Elixir strings on my acoustic, so I knew that the ones for electric would be worth the extra money (as compared to non-coated brands).
