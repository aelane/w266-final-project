Just to keep picks in my guitar case. I think i putted about 7 picks in it, but hey, it works and i would buy it again.I forgot to say that there is double sided tape on the back if you want to put it on your guitar (thats what i did, it looks good and durable).Also, It's Cheap!!!! You can transport and organize your picks without making a mess inside the gig bag. Can hold up to 11 picks of .50 thickness. Easy to use - it was easy to put the picks in and to take the picks out of it. It holds my picks. Fill them up with your favorite picks and no more searching for a pick. Little hard to put picks in but OK Holds my picks but if i move it to another part of my guitar it tends to have trouble sticking unless i force it on the guitar They were always losing their picks. All of their picks fit snugly in it and it has adhesive on the back of it so it stuck nicely to the guitar. I keep a few picks in it for easy access and I always know where to find them. I just use the excess picks I put in a ziplock bag. NO MORE misplaced or lost picks!

I lose picks so easily I needed a pick hold.

Unless you keep it full of picks it will rattle.

So I push one or two extra picks partly in the holder to stop it.
