It was the strings, and I'm very glad I replaced them with these strings. Don't panic, strings marked A/D/F#/B CAN be used just fine for G/C/E/A tuning... Addario strings are ok.. Not the best, not the worse strings, but an improvement. Bought these strings as a replacement to ones that came with my ukulele (the originals only lasted a week). Great strings! Not much to say really other then they are good strings and work. These rather inexpensive strings are not aluminum wound, but are silver plate wound - no health problems possible from strings makes them the best.

That being said: I replaced the original strings on my newMahalo U-35PK Sparkling Soprano Ukulele Outfit in Pinkwith these.

These are great strings for such a "rare" instrument.

These strings sound full and warm on the instrument.
