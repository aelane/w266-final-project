If you're into 9 gauge strings I recommend these, but I'll stick with 10s and 11s. I normally get Elixir strings, but these sounded too good to pass up. He loves these strings. Great strings with a good feel to them. Most name-brand strings are just fine, but some are markedly different than others. These strings seem less 'cutting', even after a couple of hours of constant playing. I don't go through strings that frequently (I'll change on each guitar every 2 to 3 months) so it's not a big concern for me. I've used D'Addario strings for years and they never fail me. As they are extra light strings, they serve limited purposes but as for tone quality it is very smooth and clear. I stretch new strings out of habit; I don&#8217;t like the constant slipping as they settle. I stretch all six strings in about 4-5 segments up the neck, retune, and hope for the best.There&#8217;s no whammy bar on the Artist and, for the first few days, I did a lot of blues bending to see how they&#8217;d hold up - the NYXLs stayed in tune very solidly with only minor tweaking as to be expected with any strings.I chose a darker-sounding guitar than a single-coil Fender, hoping the supposed brightness of the NYXLs would be more noticeable. They cost no more than the strings I normally get, but the tone and feel is totally different. I know the strings that I like and I tend to stick with them. These are *outstanding* strings with great durability, playability and exceptional sound. I mean, D'Addario strings are fine and all, but that's it, they've always just been your average basic string to me. These strings really do feel and sound great. I never thought I'd be praising D'Addario so much, but these strings really do deliver. I've been using D'Addario XL strings on this guitar for a while, although it's the EXL140 (slightly larger bottoms). But why not give these lighter strings a try? Pretty deluxe strings for the price here on Amazon. Doesn't happen when I pick up my other electric that don't have these strings on it yet.

I've used their strings for electric & acoustic bass, electric and acoustic guitar, Irish bazouki, mandolin, Irish tenor banjo, 5 string banjo & even used their octave mandolin strings on my Serbian brach always with stellar results.

When they said these were deluxe premium strings I knew it wouldn't be hype.

I usually change my strings every other week when I'm playing regularly so I'm already passed my regular limit.
