I like the leather ends and it adjust easily and stays put. The leather ends are VERY stiff and VERY difficult to use. It has excellent leather ends with slots cut into the leather to put over you guitar buttons (not-included). But I work with leather and I found a nice piece of rawhide lace to serve this purpose. I say rubber like because they seem more like a synthetic leather but with more flexibility. I also like the leather ends, because they dont shift and move around quite as much as my old plastic-ey one did. The soft yet thick leather ends will really protect the finish. I was surprised how well made the leather harnesses are and I have had no issue with them stretching on the strap posts of my Dot Studio. The leather is real thick and stiff which make is very unlikely to come off your guitar.

It's very nice and durable, though the leather on the ends was really tough to get around the strap holders on the guitar since the strap is really heavy-duty.

Well, you get what you pay for - leather looking paper wouldn't hold guitar.

The leather eds are nice and thick so the hook wont slip off the strap pegs.
