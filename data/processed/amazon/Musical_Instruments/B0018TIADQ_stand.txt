Looks really nice when you have an electric or acoustic on the stand. This stand is made of quality products. Padding on the stand also ensures that your guitar stays protected. Great stand for the price!! Is a good stand. This seems to be a nice, rugged stand. This is a very well-built stand. Great stand, durable, folds down nicely and really does the job! The stand arrived very quickly. Now with this stand it sits front and center next to my computer. When I got the stand and opened it for the first time and tried to put my Fender Jazz bass on it - lol - no way. This stand is exactly what I hoped it would be. It is all I want or need from a stand. Its a nice stand....cheap, but should suffice. great stand well made safe for ur guitar and practical w safety cord on top . Works great as a stand for the Elec.Guitar. I bought this stand for my sons first guitar but I may have to order myself one as well. I was amazed how much better this stand was then the one I had just bought at Guitar Center for the same price. This stand is built much better. I purchased this stand for my electric guitar and used it for a couple of weeks before the weak weld broke on the neck holder at the top when I placed my guitar in it. The stand might work fine if you don't fold it up regularly and if you leave it set up- but If you need portability and durability- I would definitely purchase a better quality stand. This stand really is pretty tough. I have found the stand to be very stable. I've used this stand for about two years now and it held up great. I use this stand to put my acoustic guitar on it. Good little stand to hold your guitars. All in all, unless there is some specialized stand need, I would first come to Musician's Gear.

I feared that this stand was not big enough for my guitarr&oacute;n which is at least as big as, but much thicker than, a cello.

The stand is fully as steady as I had hoped it possibly could be, especially given the price.

Amazing.Anyway, I gigged with this stand today and had no problems at all.
