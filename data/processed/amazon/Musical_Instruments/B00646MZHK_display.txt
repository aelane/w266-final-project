The display is much more readable and after several months of use display is still bright. So the display is very readable but not as accurate as prior display screens. The display is so nice, the quality is amazon, and this thing is beyond accurate! Response and visual display are awesome. I was hesitant to purchase this, as I really like the display of the previous models. The display is good sized and easy read (without my reading glasses) and the tuner responds quickly and accurately. The Snarks are dependable and have an easy to read display. The display is very readable but you have to be looking atit from a near perpendicular angle. The display is a little brighter, but I think the battery life is a little less than the originals. It has a nice bright easy to read display in any lighting situation and makes tuning a breeze and not a hassle (just as it should be - I've personally always hated those Boss pedal tuners). I've been so impressed by how easy this is to read, that I'll probably buy one for myself now.Other than a great display and accurate tuning... this is made with a move-able arm between the tuner and the clip.

The display is bright and easily readable and can turn any which way you like.

Turning it on though, the display is quite different.

I feel the display is an improvement - easy on the eyes.
