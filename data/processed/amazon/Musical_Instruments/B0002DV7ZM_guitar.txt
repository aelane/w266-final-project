It has cushin/ padding so my guitar is safe - it's small but stady. The guitar inside the bag fits perfectly too. it is light, non obtrusive, holds the guitar well, and it is portable when Mr. Highly recommend this for the guitar player. Easy to put together and holds my guitar very well. I haven't really used this guitar stand because I have been keeping my acoustic guitar in the case so I can keep the humidity nice adding water to a sponge I cut and placed into a plastic bag that I poked tiny holes in with a small nail. This little guitar stand works very well. Holds my guitar perfectly. Extremely lightweight, compact and portable, it folds up really small so that you can carry it in your guitar case, gig bag or tuck it in the back of your amp, When I get another guitar, I will get another Fender stand to go with it. My guitar doesn't fall down anymore.

I highly recommend it.My guitar teacher suggested that I keep my guitar(s) out because he said that if I kept it/them in a visible, easily-accesible place that I would practice more, even if it was just a few minutes and he was absolutely right.

I thought it might not be tall enough to hold my guitar securely but it does.

Perhaps it might be too light for a very heavy guitar.
