good cable doesn't tangle very good ends I've kinda forgot I even bought this, it's just another cable in the mess of cables I already have! Just a good, basic, cable. This cable is great for XLR microphones or DI-boxes. the cable wire is rubber coated and is easy to roll and store, the wire is very thin. I;ve ahd this cable pair for more than 2 years and have had no problems with them at all. It's a mic cable haha. It's a great cable for the price.

cable works perfect no defects, cystal clear sound, constructed well, use them in the studio, no noticiable problems, do not know how road worthy they are because I am a studio rat and not performer.

It is a  nice cable for the money seams to be made well.
