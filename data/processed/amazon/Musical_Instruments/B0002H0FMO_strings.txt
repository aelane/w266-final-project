These strings fill and fit the acoustic spectrum nicely. I started experimenting on strings, I'll try using bronze strings. I decided I would use bronze strings for my acoustic guitar for most of the time. The strings are well made and I've never had an issue with quality. 80/20 strings "blend" really well on my cheap Jasmine guitar. Phosphor Bronze strings are required to give that old box some snap. I love these strings...they sound awesome on my acoustic. Not strings recommended for beginners, due to the bigger gauge. I can't handle #12 strings and the sound of #10 is terrible. I prefer #12 strings for finger picking but they hurt my hands.

I bought these strings to replace the strings on my Hofner acoustic.

These strings I put on my Taylor GA4E.

These strings fit very nicely for a acoustic guitarist that is playing with a bassist and supporting instruments.
