I purchased this amp locally and initially, I thought it was pretty cool as it was my first modeling amp; lots of potential for a limitless variety of sounds. This was my first Fender amp as well.The presets were neat and all, but when I played around with some of the "standard" models (just the amp model, no effects) just to see how it's clean sound was, the amp just hissed as if I had the volume cranked with a distortion pedal engaged at max. You may get an amp that doesn't have these problems, you may not notice the sounds or you may not even care; let your ears tell you what sounds good.This amp has a lot of potential for great sounds, and it would have been nice to have faithful modeling of some great vintage amps, but in my opinion, technical issues have made this amp sound like complete garbage. I can't say enough good about this amp. He loves it.Great amp. The Classic Vibe 60's Strat really impresses me through this amp. I am really loving it!This amp can play really really loud with it's 100 Watts, but you can also play it with great tone at very low volumes. This amp is perfect for me. The amp models are great, and the factory installed presets are a great variety of usable sounds. After buying it, I have listed a Tube amp and several effects pedals that I have loved because I no longer will play it.There is no better modeling amp for my needs!

It is not nearly as heavy as I would expect a 100W amp to be, but seems well put together.ControlsThe III comes with a 2 button Foot Pedal which feels very solid and works perfectly.

This amp has a lot of great character and you can make it bluesy or really make it heavy and bold to play metal, thrash or whatever.

They ALL sound very cool on this amp.
