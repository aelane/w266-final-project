Snark tuners are great! I've heard about the Snark tuners before, and have seen them once in awhile, but while skimming the music side of Amazon I finally picked this up...and it works GREAT! I own a few tuners, including a Boss Tu-70. These tuners are amazing! They work better than tuners costing ten times as much!You don't have to be a rocket scientist to use it. I bought one of Snark's "Super Tight" tuners and found it to be less then advertised. I own several of the Snark tuners. There are other tuners by Snark that are more sensitive to lower ranges and higher ranges, so check out what suits your needs. These tuners (including the red version) are the best. I have many tuners, from expensive Peterson and Boss, Korg, Seiko, Quiktune, and many other brands, from standard tuners to a few different brands of clip ons. I've bought quite a few tuners over the years. Who doesn't love these tuners? I bought this because I got tired of looking up by-ear tuners online. These Snark tuners are ruggedly designed and really do the trick.

I have always hated tuners; I would rather use tuning fork on the A string and go from there.

Most tuners are too cumbersome and require large batteries or external power(pedals).

These tuners are so convienient and I have yet to see a musician I show these to who who doesn't appreciate it's simplicity.
