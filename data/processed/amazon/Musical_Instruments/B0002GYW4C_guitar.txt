I keep it in my guitar case and use it often! This sure wipes down any guitar to get finger prints and such off. Do NOT use these to polish your guitar. I use it dry to wipe down the acoustic guitar strings after each time playing and the tone lasts much, much longer. It helps to clean the guitar. I have an eletric acoustic guitar and it was a good choice to buy this! I will bekeeping it in my guitar case just for this particular guitar finish and use each time I am done playing. Big and wide enough to handle any guitar. Works great for polishing and buffing guitar finish. It began to tear on my guitar strings. It doesn't scratch the guitar and works great!

My guitar always looks brand new after using this cloth, and I use the thing almost every day.I got on this rant bc I came here to replace mine after giving it away to a friend who fell in love with it.

Now to thereview.My guitar has an Ebony hard lacquer finish, meaning very glossy and shiny.

Since then I have beenable to keep the guitar polished and clean using only the 'Planet Waves Microfiber Polish Cloth'.
