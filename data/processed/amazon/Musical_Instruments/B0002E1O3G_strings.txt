Love these strings. I use them exclusively on my Gibson LP Studio Deluxe because it seems to corrode ordinary strings quickly. Need some strings and was ordering other stuff so bought to piggy back on shipping. that is supposed to last longer than average strings. Yes, these strings are amazing. They do, however, seem to take a little more breaking in than other strings...but it's worth it. I occasionally use other strings for fun, but these will always be my go to strings every time. I have been using these strings for the last 7 years. I will buy these strings until the day I die. I bought these strings after buying some Elixir strings for my acoustic, which I was pretty happy with. I convinced myself that it was these strings that were causing all my problems, and I was right. I did feel like I could move up and down the fretboard easily with these strings, but the lack of sustain and tone have forced me to stay way from these electric strings permanently. I now rub down the strings thoroughly after each session playing them, but this stil happens.Then I happened across these Elixir nanowebs. I no longer need to rub down my strings so thoroughly, and they stay rust and gunk-free for 2+ weeks (of regular playing). With regular strings, you can tell the string is near the end of its life b/c it looks really bad. Pricey as far as strings go.

These are the best strings ever.

With the Nanowebs, they sound AND feel like regular strings, but last forever.

I really like these strings, because I have sweaty hands that tend to make the strings on my guitars corrode and rust very fast.
