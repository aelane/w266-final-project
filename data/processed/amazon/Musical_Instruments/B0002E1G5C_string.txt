It winds well and can cut off excess string thereafter. I won't rant about a string winder.. The string cutter works great, one squeeze and any size string is cut cleanly. I just wanted a string winder at first but thought this one was kinda cool and reasonably priced too. I didn't expect the string cutter to be as well as it is. Primarily purchased to have a string cutter in the guitar case rather than going to get one from my tool box.Found the pin puller did not really work for me, so put my old string winder from 20 yrs. And the string winder itself also works well. The string cutter is very handy. The string cutter works better than expected. I've only used the string winder so far, but it works well so far. is fast to tight up the string and it has a cutter if you (like me) don't like the extra hanging from the guitar like cat mustache.Recomended! I broke a string on stage and instead of having a big floppy string, with just a quick squeeze it looked good. It is a string winder, what more can I say. You never know when you have to replace a string and this is a convenient helper. The string winder is a little awkward. Built-in string cutter and bridge pin remover is a plus. I used to just coil the string ends at the adjustment keys, but this trims steel and nylon with ease. It cuts the string and winds the pegs much easier than one could do by hand. I hope it goes away with use.The string cutter works like a champ. They don't cut the string they shear it off. Also, with the string winder I also purchased accoustic guitar strings and requested regular shipping (free shipping) which promised that the items would be shipped within 5 to 7 days. I purchased this before I have ever changed a string. The string cutter is too bulky to use in most cases so I still need a set of snips when using this thing. Simply one of the best string winders I have ever used to date and I love it because I having large hands it really makes a difference. Not forget the added string cutter and peg puller to boot. So I bought this to replace the original string winder I had that doesn't have a clipper on the end, and it turned out great. The string winder with a string cutter and pin puller is an excellent design. A string winder and cutter ! I've had string winders for years, but never a multifunction one like this. The string cutter works well, and the peg puller does also. It's a great string winder, and it is so nice being able to wind and cut the string with the same tool. Works well enough as a string winder, but I was really lookin for something to pull my bridge pins with and for me, this did not work well at all. I like this string winder, and it is convenient having the wire cutter there too, but the &#34;bridge pin puller&#34; is too small, and doesn't work on my instruments. I really like the string cutter built into the frame, and the peg puller is my favorite feature.

For about $8 you get a string winder, string cutter and an acoustic peg remover all-in-one.What more can you ask for?Mine shows no sign of wear or defects after about a year of use.I have nice wire cutters, etc (I'm an EE) but it is much easier to grab one tool instead of two or three.As for quality, it has an unconditional guarantee, see above.Planet Waves -aka D'Addario- is a well-known name in guitar accessories.To the reviewers complaining about the tool breaking, try using your warranty instead of whining.No manufacturer has a perfect run forever, but at least in this case you have not wasted your money.For the record, I do not work for D'Addario / Planet Waves - but I would not dismiss a job off-hand if they offered it  ;-)

The string cutter is a great feature and appreciated, works well regardless of string composition type,...stainless, chromes, core-types, etc.

I bought this mainly for the string cutter, although it has a peg winder and a bridge pin puller as well.
