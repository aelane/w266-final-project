The Snark SN-2 is much more accurate, but its LCD display is not very bright, and has a narrow field of view. The display is bright and very intuitive to the way we visualize sound, that is what makes it so useful. Bright display, easy to use, works well and cheap. The display is very easy to read...better than the GoGo (although GoGo has a new improved display since I bought mine). The display colors are bright and easy to read. The display is bright and clear, easy to see in the dark. The display is bright and easy to read, and the graph has a lot of resolution. A multicolored display shows if you are sharp or flat. Works well - but be careful when swivelling the display as it can easily break one of the four tabs it clips into. The display is so easy to read and tuning is easier than ever. The display is better than most I've used (dating back 30 years). The display is nice and bright as well.

LCD is bright and clear, and needle-ish display works as expected.It worked very well on violin too.

The Korg was durable and fairly accurate but the LCD display wasn't lit making it tough to read in low light and the needle seemed to jump around sometimes for no good reason.

The display pivots to any angle.
