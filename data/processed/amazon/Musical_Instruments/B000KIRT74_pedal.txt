The most diverse pedal I own. I was happy with the Boss, but I decided to try this B. pedal, and I'm glad I did. It does add sustain, but it can't compare with the B. pedal's effect, which implies a power barely held in check, just exactly what I was after. What can I say that you haven't already read about this amazing pedal? If you thinking about buying the other green overdrive pedal you can save big green with this pedal. This is the first pedal, I've had to actually read the manual, in order to figure out how to install the battery! I love this pedal. Typical Behringer pedal with plastic case but a really good sound. The pedal works as described. You have to take the pedal off to access the battery. That being said, I don't feel concerned at all that this pedal will suddenly break on me; don't be too rough with it and it should last a good while. The pedal arrived and I spent an hour playing with it on the starcaster. Then I ordered this pedal and three others (graphic equalizer; MXR carbon copy delay; T-REX reverb)  I figured that I would find a good tone for both blues and other music from something within this combo. I found that when I plug this pedal into my old 8 watt Peavey Rage, I get better tone and volume than either of the two new amps using them alone or with any combination of the four pedals. I still might keep this pedal though, cause it's easily the next best thing to the VHT Special 6 tube amp.

What I love about this pedal is the TONE knob.

This pedal is based on the famous Ibanez TS-808 pedal.

But considering that Behringer is offering this pedal for [...], it's clear that in order for Behringer to offer such great tone at such a low price, sacrifices in build quality had to be made.
