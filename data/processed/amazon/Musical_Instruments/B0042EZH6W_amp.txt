This amp looked suspiciously cheap and, although the reviews were great, still was concerned whether it would be good enough. This amp is a ton of fun. It is a fun little amp for both pros and beginners alike. I can record directly from the amp into my PC Mixpad software program. I downloaded and linked to the amp, there I saw you can make a lot of changes that can't be done with just the knobs. I expected the amp to be received and check out and only then a exchange amp sent to me. This is really a great amp for the price. This amp will help you figure out what tones you like for the music you want to play.I considered various new/used amps in the same price range, and I'm extremely happy I picked this one. Bought this amp probably about two years ago. The amp has 3 levels of 8 presets each, for a total of 24 unique presets, ranging form heavy metal distortion sounds and reverberating clean tones. The amp includes gain, a volume and separate master volume knob in addition to bass and treble knobs. A great amp for practice and beginners. All I wanted was a warm up amp with real tone, and this is that and plenty more. And this amp is so accurate that I can.Above all, this Mustang is MUSICAL. For a small amp that's a real feat, but for 100 clams it's a near miracle. Great little amp, just not for me. This amp is awesome! The amp itself has 24 presets (as advertised) & are shown in 3 different colors (Red, Green, & Orange)  and you can totally customize the presets. I bought this amp along with a Epi Les Paul 100. Each of the 9 amp models has been pre-programmed with three different presets (meaning a professional put three different combinations of effects on the amp model to showcase its best sounds).When you select a preset, like the first metal 2000 for example, the minute you touch the "gain" knob, the gain that was programmed for that preset now becomes whatever level you set. Great little amp, but get a tube amp if you're serious about playing guitar. I just sold my Fender Super Champ XD and wasn't going to get another amp because playing in my apartment with neighbors, I just cannot jam the way I'd like to...I really liked all the above named amps but they really didn't give me the options of cranking it without disturbing my neighbors. I mean its only a $100 amp so it cannot be compared to the real deals, but it does stand up pretty nice. This little amp is amazing. I've only had this amp now for roughly a day, but stayed up a good part of last night playing. Absolutely more than enough amp for your practice and small-event purposes. But it's nice to know this amp can deliver, either with or without the additional FUSE software, such an incredibly diverse array of sounds should the need ever arise. First and foremost this amp is AMAZING. The amp gives an audiable POP when powered down. All in all if you are looking for a great small amp this will give you $1000's of dollars worth of effects and amp models all for under 100 clams! This amp is packed with features. Great little amp to mess around with. When I bought this it wasn't the amp I wanted but because of budget and reviews I picked it. The Princeton amp emulation is SWEET.

I bough this amp for my 9 year old son who is learning guitar for his Christmas present.

I am actually selling my nice Tube amp and using the Mustang as my only amp for now, and I feel like I am not missing out on any features or downgrading my sound at all.The value of this amp is amazing.
