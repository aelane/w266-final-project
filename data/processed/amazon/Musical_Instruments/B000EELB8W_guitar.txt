Now i can see how guitar stores keep them looking so nice. If you want a nice looking guitar for the stage or display, this stuff works. I'm not very diligent in my guitar maintenance, so this bottle should last me for years. Smells nice and makes your guitar looking new! I like this cleaner - it's gentle on my guitar finish and it doesn't smell bad either. This has got to be one of the best polish ive ever used on a guitar?Going to also last for a long time, cause just a small amount goes a long ways. Once you put it on initially, you can simply buff your guitar with a dry cloth for the next two or three cleanings and the shine comes right back. It's cleaned and polished pretty my Taylor guitar pretty well.

Also I use it on my guitar neck and fretboard and keeps it smooth and shiny.

This is the best guitar cleaner and polish I have ever used.

My guitar polishes up really nice after wiping it down with the dunlop 65. nothing to complain about.
