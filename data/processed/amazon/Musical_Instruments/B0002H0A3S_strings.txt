I use these strings on most of my acoustic guitars, except for the smaller Takamine New Yorker and A&L; Ami (I use the D'Addario custom lights). These strings are quite durable and long-lasting. There are coated strings that will last longer, but I don't like spending so much on strings. I've use these strings for years. I play often and like to change strings often. I replaced them with Elixir nanoweb coated strings and they also sounded good, but the finish was wearing fast. I may just change the strings completely again to see If I just have some dead strings. These were the same strings originally strung on my Godin Seagull, and I absolutely love their sound, feel, and durability. I love the strings and their price, definitely will stick with this brand as well. You don't have to worry about mixing up your strings. These are the only strings I use on my acoustic/electric. I haven't tried many different strings. I have used the strings (D'addario EXP) that came with on my Takamine GS330S, and it's been good for year+. IIf the strings break, I will try this one GS330S as well. After the strings were set and "stretch" for few days playing, it stays in tune. The strings were set for more than 6 months, they still are playable, and the sounds are okay on kid size guitar. These are the only strings that hold up well to the tension of an open &#34;A&#34; tuning. I highly recommend these acoustic strings, they are also available in light or heavy guageif you prefer. It is fine strings,i couldn't really find difference between martin m140maybe its just me, i expected more than that!its just regular strings Right now I am experimenting with different strings so I cant say if they are better than others. These are the strings for Takamine guitars. I prefer the light strings but you have to allow them to stretch a little or you might break on when changing. I really believe in these strings. I guess they think you need big, think strings to produce volume....not so. Some say thin strings break easily, but you should change strings often anyway. But after changing the strings it sounds like an expensive Martin. have to reorder soon  great strings for the money. I tried these strings on my Zager guitar. Arrgh!Same great strings and tone, but now you have to unwind them from their &#34;pairs&#34; and lay them out two-at-a-time...kind of aggravating, but NO FRIGGIN' WAY WOULD I EVER USE ANOTHER STRING! While these are not my very, very favorites (strictly because I prefer a slightly lighter gauging on light strings), they still do just fine--much better than some other brands I've tried. Good-sounding and playing all-around strings. these strings are great with my acoustics-however, lately i've been using electric strings instead. My favorite strings for 30 years. Have used D'Addario strings since the late 70's. far as i can tell, good strings. Good strings for the price, nice ring to them. These are the best strings I've ever put on my guitar, I play a really nice Morgan Monroe Creekside and these strings give it the fullness it deserves. Excellent strings. The strings last a long time, in my opinion. The strings were hard to slide, un-slippery, and changing barr chords made so much squeaks I didn't like. I've used these strings for longer than I'd care to admit. I put these strings on every acoustic I own. You can't go wrong with D'Addario strings! I played with light acoustic strings for a long time. Great strings, fully recommended. I prefer placing electric strings on acoustic. These strings are both smooth sounding and easy on the fingers. I switch acoustic strings 3-4 times a month on my 2 main guitars. These are my go-to acoustic strings. The strings sound great on my full size acoustic - nice bright, but warm tone, full bodied sound - but not so great on my 3/4 size guitar. The E and B strings never have enough coating, but still. Even the light strings don't sound tinny, which amazed me compared to other big names. Always buy D'Addario strings for my 7 guitars. Those strings stay tuned longer and will last me a little longer than others I have tried and believe me when I say that I tried many other types. good strings These strings aren't even that expensive, actually they're only a few more dollars than the usual cheap strings I put on my guitar. The strings are high quality and they feel so smooth under my fingertips! I gave these strings a try, but I don't care for them that much. I put these strings on my Martin guitar after receiving my new DVD from customerservice@peghead.nl entitled "How to Play Fingerstyle Guitar" by Eltjo Haselhoff, whose preview of this GREAT DVD I found on YouTube. I really like these strings. For me these strings bring it all together and are my string of choice for all 12 acoustic electrics I use to play what I consider rock ballads using my strumming-style of play.I love the feel and tone of these strings for my style of play and my equipment set-up. Yet, I seem to manage to break the high E & B strings on a regular basis (by playing, not by over tuning). I change strings frequently so I don't think this is the reason they are breaking.Overall, I am willing to put-up with what I believe to be some premature breakage (especially with the G string), for the other qualities that draw me to the EJ26 strings. Great strings and the best packaging. I use these strings on my Ovation Legend, for acoustic leads. These strings get a workout, and I change strings when I start to lose sustain. These strings are what I use on all  of my acoustic guitars. Terrific strings for the price of cheapies. I needed to replace the strings on my acoustic, and chose these D'Addario's based on price and the favorable reviews given them by other users. In short, these strings make playing so much more enjoyable, I wish I'd gotten them from the start. I replace my strings about once a month with casual play and proper maintenance so why run to the store or pay for shipping 10 times a year. The strings are great, priced great and was on sale which made it even better. They last pretty long for non-coated strings and play nicely, too. I recently acquired a Guild six string that I strung with my usual EJ16 strings, however, it just wasn't playing or sounding as good as I knew it could. I have been using these strings for years and have been happy with them but the last couple of sets have lost the tone completely on strings 4,5,6 within 3 days of installing. Some strings sound dull right out of the package. These strings are brilliant, bringing out the full tone and maximum volume from the guitar. These strings are medium-mellow, just enough to allow one to enjoy the sound without falling asleep. Thicker strings are often more difficult to play and can even damage some guitars. These strings are just right-- especially the 53mm E, which provides the proper amount of bass without overkill or difficulty in strumming.SUMMARY:  These are excellent strings, which doesn't surprise me since I've use D'Addario classical guitar strings for years. Martin and GHS are both good strings, but somehow D'Addario just shines.Thanks to Amazon enthusiasts who helped me decide to give these a try. I love the strings so far, just put them on my Jasmine by Takamine guitar today (2-20-14) and they sound amazing, very bright tone, I will be using D'Addario strings from now on, very pleased with them. These are great strings.

These strings from D'Addario are a personal favorite of mine.

I love how they color code their strings on the "ball ends".

To me this makes it much easier when changing strings.
