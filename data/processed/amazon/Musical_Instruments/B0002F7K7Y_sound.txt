They have a really full sound, bright highs, and they bend like crazy. They have a clear, bright sound that great for picking and strumming. Pretty good sound quality, and i like the idea that they pack the strings in a moisture-resistant package to prevent corrosion. The sound and feel are perfect, and I find that they last much longer than more expensive coated strings. I think I might try 9's on the Sheraton but even as is they play (and sound) very good. The sound produced was very similar to that of the more expensive strings that previously were on the guitar, which leads me to my closing point.Overall, I was very pleased with the performance of these strings and when you consider the fact that they only cost around $3,  D'Addario EXL110's will be put in my "Best Buy" category for future purchases. They have a clearer sound, and seem to hold their tune better than most.If you're looking for acoustic strings, you can't beat the phosphorus bronze for warmth and clarity. Nice sound for a nice price... Great for bending and awesome sound.

Their new sound is quite bright as advertised, but has far less of what I call `new string jangle', which is fine by me.

Finally nailing a sound and feel you've been chasing after for years makes it all worth it.

The best sound I got was on my strat.
