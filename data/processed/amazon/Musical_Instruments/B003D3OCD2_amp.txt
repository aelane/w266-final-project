I did not think that an amp this size would sound good. THis amp is LOUD...VERY LOUD!!!!! All in all a super amp. Well this amp does have it's pros and cons, however the cons are overshadowed by the pros.Pros:1) Small!!!! Solos just sing on this amp. It WILL overheat the amp and start acting weird. How does an amp just come down half price over night? Not sure if this amp deserves the 5 stars it is getting, and certainly not because it can bludgeon someone to death in an alley. This amp can easily cut through drums, even in the close confines of his practice studio. That means that you can use ths amp as a head by turning the 6.5 inch internal speaker off, or have it active with a cab as a set of external speakers in addition to the internal one.Plugging phones into the headphone jack will NOT turn off the internal speaker. I bought this amp for a couple of reasons- I wanted a combo that was light in weight, easy to move,store, and carry, and also was clean sounding and slightly loud. It is definitely a clean, noise-free amp at moderate sound levels, and I can add effects through my Line6 Pod Pro if I want to, like more drive, reverb, etc.. As far as durability goes, I've only had it for a day, so I can't say. I've played through the amp for a couple weeks now, and it's great.

The amp has limited gain available to give you traditional tube behavior.

I was amazed at how small the amp was when I first purchased it - tiny.

I would recommend this amp (obviously I gave it 5 stars).
