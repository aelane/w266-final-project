This 25' cable gives him flexibility to move around and it is sturdy enough that it can take being stepped on and pulled around.The cable works well and is a good value for a decent quality cable.Highly Recommended!CFH This is good cable. Grade A+ cable at a very affordable price. Pretty crappy cable. Like my first Hosa cable, this is a high quality item. This is a good solid cable with no problems. Hosa cable quality can be all over the place, some of their products are good (sound good, reliable, long lasting) and some of their products are not good (affect sound negatively, break prematurely, short useful life span).These guitar cords are actually quite nice, they feel good (gooey soft rubber jacket like Mogami), they sound good and so far they are working reliably, the rubber jacket is about .25&#34; in diameter (by eye) and there is a short heat shrink overwrap to add strength where the wire enters the plug.I bought these when I needed cables fast for an internet concert, we had lots of pedals and signal splits to connect up. It's a cable, no frills, tangles pretty easy and due to it's design it might rattle a little when you move around but it works like it should I never really considered a cheaper cable, I was always taught to get the best I could afford. When this showed up in a cable search on amazon, I jumped on it. This cable disproves the notion that you get what you pay for. Let's face it, a cable is a cable is a cable. I replaced a lighter cable with this one and I was surprised at the difference in the quality of the sound from my amp. I was looking for a long cable to perform live with my band and i'm glad with HOSA quality. Good cable, as good as any expensive brand. I've only recieved one bad cable out of around 50 or so.

I didn't expect this cable to be so thin.
