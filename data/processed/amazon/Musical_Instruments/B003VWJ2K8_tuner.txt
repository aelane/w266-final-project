One of the best tuner's out there!! great tuner! I've had the same tuner for years. It tunes better than any tuner I've ever used. This tuner really opened my eyes to how much even being a little bit off can change the sound. But the tuner was a snap to figure out and I had my bass tuned in less than a half hour. Awesome tuner ! It seems to me that this tuner works by sensing vibrations of things that it is in contact with. This Snark tuner is a very clever gadget that is simple to use (even for my children) and works well. This tuner clips on easily to all the instruments I have, shows pitch quickly and accurately. I bought this as a second tuner for gigs. Even though I have a tuner in my pedalboard setup, and one on my iMac via MainStage 3, the Snark is indispensable. Way better than digging out the tuner from the case in the closet, finding a expensive 9 volt battery, selecting a note you want to tune and  waiting for a needle to stop moving on  my crappy old tuner. Now the Snark comes along and the Boss tuner (reliable and true) sits in the bag with other accessories I use, but it has no need to come out. Great little tuner. this is the 2nd tuner like this that I have purchased. I think it's the best tuner I've owned and it really does an excellent job. It's fast and easy just like a tuner should be. My old monochrome digical tuner had a needle that would jump around making tuning difficult. Very good tuner and I love that it attached to the instrument and you can leave it there. I purchased this tuner for my 9 year old who is beginning guitar and it is 100% accurate and very easy to use. You can read about what this tuner does and does not do in the specs section or from other reviewers who tend to review specs instead of how they like or dislike something. This tuner, the SNARK, fits on my Godin's small headstock with no problems. I love this little tuner. i love this tuner so much! The GoGo is awesome and instantly became the only tuner I use. The tuner workss as advertised. The Fender tuner in my opinion, and for my needs is more accurate and easier to see due to the fact that it gives a nice green color once you tune up. This is so much better than my Intellitouch tuner and cost less than half of what I paid for the Intellitouch. I had never owned an electronic tuner before, but have used the large models and the iPhone apps. It's a great little tuner! This tuner can be adjusted to be very easy to see when you tune your instrument.It senses the vibrations of the string through the neck and head, so the sounds of other instruments do not effect the tuning.Very light, so I leave it on when I play...and it turns itself off when I forget, so it doesn't unnecessarily drain the batteries.Inexpensive so can afford three, one for a banjo, one for a bass and one for a guitar to keep in each instrument's case. This is one tuner you won't want to be without, and, the only one you need. That being said, This is the most user friendly little tuner I have ever owned. I really like this little tuner is is maintenance free, small light and easy to use. This is a great tuner for the price it looks slick and is a quality.product whether.u r a beginner or in a band this tuner will meet all of your needs. This tuner works great, easy to attach, turn on and adjusting the guitar to each individual string, is as easy as one two three. This tuner will tune chromatically, so you don't need to buy a special tuner for that. I chose it over my other chromatic tuner the night my daughter was to play guitar in her school's talent show. My other chromatic clip-on tuner had some trouble with the D and low E strings but this tuner seems to give me a pitch quickly.I like this tuner a lot and highly recommend it. This tuner gave me problems at first because I did not know how to use it. This tuner works really well, i bought one a few months ago and it's super precise. This tuner is nice , inexpensive and very easy to use. I highly recommend this tuner. Solid tuner, more accurate than I anticipated and very easy to use. This is a great little tuner. But this is excellent for what it is:  an easy-to-clip-on tuner that can be used on any instrument. This tuner gets the job done but the part that connects the clip to the tuner is very weak and can break off easily. Very accurate tuner BUT it broke within the first week I used it. I have a more "sophisticated" tuner and the Snark works faster and is much easier to use. At first I was skeptical of this nifty little tuner, but since I've been using it for the past few weeks, I've yet to have one complaint. I have a built in tuner, but the Snark is so easy to use and inexpensive, it is a great deal. Admittedly you can do this with with a jack-in tuner without the jack-in part, but the results aren't always that good, and you have to fish around for the tuner.The whole turn the amp down, unplug from the amp, jack into a tuner, unplug from the tuner, plug back into the amp, turn the amp up process every time something sounded a bit off always soured me and brought down my enthusiasm while practicing/playing the guitar, but those days are over. This tuner is perfect it sits nicely on the head, swiveling head, visible from wherever you are. This tuner is great, and it being so low price makes it even more better, standard shipping took 2 days to reach me in Mass. The tuner comes with a 2032 (circle) battery, and its as simple as pushing the power button and strumming the guitar strings. Its a nice little tuner, and my guitar is sounding great. Purchased this Snark tuner after reading a few positive reviews and decided to give it a try. This tuner is easy to use. This tuner is and I am very happy with this purchase. I tested the Snark against them, my Korg tuner and my Android App tuner. Sometimes you just need to whack the tuner a bit, and it's okay. I also have the NS Micro, and that's a better tuner. The chromatic tuner is extremely easy to read and incredibly simple, and it automatically recognizes which notes are being played and adjusts to the note as you tune up and down. I've had this tuner for about a month now and it hasn't failed me yet, though sometimes it can be a little stubborn and slow with determining when a note is being played and it does have a habit of being right on the mark one time, then if you pluck the string again, it will show it's off tune by a quarter-step or so. Having the tuner respond this quickly makes tuning go faster and easier. A great little tuner. But I would use no other tuner on stage. Awesome little tuner, very accurate and I can store it almost anywhere. this tuner is awsome,it tunes very acurately and i would recommend it to any guitarist or who ever needs a tunner. If looking for an inexpensive tuner look no further!

Good tuner, unlucky with two lemons I guess.

I would say it was the best clip-on tuner I've had a chance to use, except that it broke the first time I carried it in my gig bag to a rehearsal.

The tuner itself is great, but the product fails because it broke in 5 minutes.
