The amp is now capable of being used at small gigs. I've been using this amp for a few months and I'm very pleased with the overall quality and performance. The amp has two shades or flavors as I call it. The amp itself hooks right into your USB connection such as Gargeband or other recording boards or software. The amp is all tube and sounds better the longer you leave it on... I have used this amp on smaller gigs without any problems. If your looking for a studio/home/1st amp you can't go wrong with this guy. You can make this amp sound many different ways and with an FX chain in front of channel one (how I run it) the sky is the limit. right now this amp doesn't need to be tweaked for me...I loved it right out of the box! With this amp everything is built in.Fifth, unlike a lot of tube amps, this one gets very quiet. The amp weighs in at 24 pounds and is extremely portable with the handle on top.

However, this is both my first Fender amp, as well as my first true &#34;tube&#34; amp.

The amp has TONS of high-end sparkle, but some of the settings only start to open up if you increase the volume (true of many amps).

But, again, the amp is plenty loud and full-sounding for its size.
