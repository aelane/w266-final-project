When I bought these I was looking for pop filters to use with a pair of condenser microphones to help keep the wind pops from ruining a recording. It works as a pop filter should and is a huge upgrade over my make-shift panty hose pop filter. Granted, you can make a make-shift pop filter using a hollow ring and nylon. As a pop filter it works perfectly and I was not able to hear any clarity loss or sound coloring. Just pop filtering through black pantyhose !! The "pop" sound is completely removed with the filter. I can't do that anymore with this pop filter on it. This should be the last pop filter I have to buy for a long time. This is a decent pop filter. Other than that, it's a decent pop filter but not for the price. When you record singing, you need this to prevent the pop sound. I love this pop filter! Very sturdy and awesome pop filter.

Yes, you can make your own pop filter at home, but you don't want to.

I don't know how it compares to other pop filters though, but this one seems like it works for me.

It's a pop filter.
