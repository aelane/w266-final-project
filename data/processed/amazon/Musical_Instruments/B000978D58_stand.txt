This stand surprised my. I was waiting for a flimsy stand to arrive when I ordered something that seemed like it would be for budget price. This stand holds it very sturdily, and with the boom feature, it can be set up in just about any position I would ever need.If you have a fairly lightweight mike and just need something to set and forget, this is a decent stand.And for less than $25 bucks, it's a bargain. This is a pretty good stand for the price, I ended up leaving this one in the rehearsal room as I prefer the telescoping booms. I really like this stand, I even bought a second one after giving it a try. Very good stand especially for the price. If you're looking for a mic stand, buy this one- you really can't go wrong. I am totally satisfied with the stand. I needed a cheap mic stand that didn't break the bank. Great entry-level stand! It is a euro stand so it has 5/8"-27 threads. This stand is probably one of the most popular among smaller bands, jammers and home studio owners because I run across them everywhere. This stand is versatile enough to be used at almost any angle. I like the stand. this stand i very good just wish it was a bit heavier for helping it be more stable when using a heavy mic. Got this stand to mount a Studio Projects C1 condenser mic. The stand is very stable and works well. Good stand, solid components, easily adjustable and the boom is good length. I actually use this stand for more than holding a mic.I use it for video and photo purposes: Holding light reflectors, flagging, speedlights, etc.It's heavier than it looks and cheaper than those stands specifically marketed for photo. This mic stand does everything it says it will, and is adjustable in every conceivable way. It is after all a cheap Chinese stand. This stand (it just arrived in the mail) will be durable in the years to come with my music I can tell. Awesome stand and I would recommend to anyone!

This stand is very flexible in the way it can be set up.

This is a fine stand for the price, but I was honestly surprised at how light it is.

I do use this stand, but I wish I would have sprung for the heavier duty version and probably will in the near future.
