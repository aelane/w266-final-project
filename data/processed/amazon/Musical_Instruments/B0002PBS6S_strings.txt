the lower strings retain the depth and sound of my usual strings. I'll try to review the strings and not the instrument but that's kinda hard for me to do. The lower strings have a wonderful rich tone, they're fairly heavy but easy on the fingers. The high strings will talk to you. I lke these strings very much. Alright strings. I've always used Ernie Ball strings. the only strings I get are Ernie Ball strings. Ernie Ball knows how to do strings

After using D'Addario strings I've try to Ernie Ball strings.

the high strings are thinner and thus much easier to play and bend.
