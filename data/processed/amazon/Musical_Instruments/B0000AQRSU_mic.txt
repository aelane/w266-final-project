He had a different Shure mic and it was totally flat compared to this particular model. It is not a bad mic for the price ( If you want a real good one with studio quality mic it would cost over 600 bucks) but it is no comparison to a studio mic since I have worked in a recording studio. This mic is quite good for its price. This mic can be turned up louder than almost any other mic without that annoying PA squeal. Great all around mic used for vocals. When I borrow a Shure SM-58 mic from someone, the difference is instant and dramatic--it's a far more efficient (i.e. The former mic is a little more ostentatious, but it's also slightly more adaptable, and the screen can filter out a certain amount of wind noise and unwanted non-musical sounds. The mic is well made (heavy on the &#34;mic&#34; end), but I have yet to try it with my pop filter and multi-track studio.

The SM-58 is a very good vocal mic and for some people probably the best choice.

This mic does not pick up well from much over 8 inches away.

The live vocal mic that works best for me is the Shure SM-57 with a windscreen.
