The picks came before the estimated delivery date in a clearly marked package. All 12 picks were there. I love these picks. The picks were exactly as described. He is very pleased with these picks. We will be purchasing more picks in the future. I bought these picks because I liked the color of the picks.These picks surprised me with how good quality they actually are. Recommend these picks to anyone that plays guitar. These picks far exceed my expectations, I mean how good could a pick be anyway? Love these picks, pretty much the only ones I buy now, nice and flexible,great for picking, great for strumming. I love these picks. Good picks! Bought these picks for the impending Strat I'll buy, already have 3 sets of Fender strings, I will be ready! It didn't kill me not to have them - I have a million picks, I just wanted to see these in my hand.That said, I will definitely buy these again in the future and go for the different colors.Great price, great picks. I got all 12 of my picks in a plastic bag divided in half with 6 picks each. These are by far my favorite picks. These picks hold up well & that says alot because I am not easy on picks if any kind. these picks look really pretty, like seashells and they last pretty well. the thin picks are pretty thin which make them nice for acoustic strumming and whatnot- but i would recommend mediums at least for the electric guitar. The picks were reasonably priced and shipped via "prime", so I found them to be a great value as someone who only plays casually. These picks are exactly the right thickness and they play well. Hard to believe that I need to review a Pick but I really like these picks. Fender 351 Picks are some of the best picks money can buy.I have used these picks for years now and I just love them. I needed picks, so I ordered an assortment.

but the picks takes a little getting used too there VERY slippery at 1st i thought it was just me but i lended a couple to a few friends and they had the same problem but overtime you develop a better grip on them and can alternate pick, sweep pick, tremelo pick, tap with the pick better.

These are good picks and you have a good selection of colors instead of the dunlop that are color coded and your stuck with no choice.
