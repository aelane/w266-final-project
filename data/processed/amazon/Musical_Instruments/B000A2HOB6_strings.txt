and researched strings for it, and I read a comment from one person who said the lights would have slight buzz, and the mediums put too much pressure on the neck and he said the "Light- Mediums" were a happy medium and a good balance.When I got my Martin D15 M, I cleaned it up, and then restrung it with a set of these "Light -Mediums". The treble strings bend pretty easily. Lastly, and certainly the least favorably, once tuned up, the strings sounded terrible! I've never heard worse strings. I'll never buy their strings again. I would definitely buy these strings again. The lower strings (E, A G) just don't slide as easily until there is some buildup in them. Since there are two strings to an envelope, it seems I too easily get the strings reversed on set up. Overall good strings and I'll probably buy them again. But when it comes to guitar strings, most of the range goes from extra light to medium. love these strings, but I have always been and still am a fan of Ernie Ball, they just sound better, bend easier and have a longer life span, but Martin are very good too, I just prefer Ernie Ball, but they were sold out and I needed strings fast.

They are basic standard traditional strings.

Mostly fresh strings sound good on a guitar.

Leaving strings in for an extended period - Elixirs or other coated strings are probably a better idea.There is no such thing as a perfect guitar string for every guitar.
