May be you need to get acclimated to this pick before you can fully use it effectively and for long duration. The pick feels great in my hand and plays really well. This is not a pick for windmilling guitarists. This is a pick for the precision player. It's a very stiff pick, with just enough give to keep from sawing your strings off.The picks are first-rate. To me, this is a pick to pick notes and leads. I prefer a standard pick for that. A very nice pick, both in feel and texture.

I will never switch from the pick.

A Jazz III- sized pick (smaller than a common-sized guitar pick) that works better for me because the grip nubs make it easier to keep it in the proper angle/position

I used to lose a pick every other day.
