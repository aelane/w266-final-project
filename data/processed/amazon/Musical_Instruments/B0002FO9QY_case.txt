I think the case probably pushes the arm down a little bit even in this position. I found the Gibson case to be identical except for the color of the lining and the logo on the outside of the case. My Gibson fits perfectly in the Epiphone case. The case is very heavy and is actually heavier than the guitar. Regardless of who actually makes the case, it has to meet Epiphone's manufacturing standards so it's got to be good. This case will fit The 335 Dot, Casino, Sheraton and the Gibson ES335. This case was not intended for the Emperor II. It's a great case and will protect your guitar, but it's not designed to be thrown from a rooftop or run over by a car. This Epiphone Hardshell case is a real bargain! I feel totally secure keeping and transporting my Sheraton II in this case and unworried about it breaking apart or popping open, etc. Also, when you close the case , instead of folding in on itself it tends to stick out the back of the case, necessitating you manually pulling it into the case before fully closing. Overall, I am extremely pleased with this case and my Sheraton II is happy to have found a long term home. great case for my Epiphone Sheraton II! This case, however, fits my Dot Custom like a glove.

When my case arrived I feared it was too small to hold my Epiphone Dot.

But, this case fits my Dot like a glove.

The case is sturdy enough to protect my guitar from knocks and dings while the plush inside pampers the guitar's finish.
