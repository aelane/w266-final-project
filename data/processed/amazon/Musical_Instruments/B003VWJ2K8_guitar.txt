I have been playing acoustic guitar and banjo for years and tried several tuners. I use this for my acoustic primarily, but sometimes for my electric guitar. I have three of them so I can keep one in each guitar case. Also, don't leave it attached to any fine guitar, because it, like capos, can permanently damage the finish of  a really fine guitar. I thought this was the coolest guitar gadget. I moved from a guitar to a harp so I am tuning many more strings and this is very helpful! His guitar instructor also commented on how accurate and simple to use. He connects it to his electric guitar with out amplification and gets a tune and can be connected to the amp. It's easy to clamp onto my guitar head, and the frequency/not readings are quite accurate. It's incredibly easy to use and very handy when re-stringing a guitar. A must have for any guitar player. I put one in each of my guitar bags-can't live without it. When I attached my guitar to a Boss Chromatic and clipped on the Snark, it was spot on. I had been tuning my guitar by ear and thought I was doing a good job. After I used the Snark my guitar sounds so much better. It functions flawlessly and makes tuning my guitar quick, simple, and fun. You just clamp it onto your guitar and it picks up the vibrations, showing you when you are sharp, flat, or dead on. It does know when your guitar is in tune! These are cheap enough to buy one for every guitar and keep it in the case. They both work really well with my Taylor guitar, and my Fender Strat. I teach classical guitar and one of my students came in with this tuner. I can use it on my guitar as well as my guitarlele which is tuned a 4th higher than the guitar. I needed to be able to tune her guitar accurately and quickly despite all the noise in the large room. You have to attach it to the guitar in order for it to work, which is pretty cool. It really put yout guitar in tune. Fantastic for positioning it anywhere on the guitar. I would recommend this to any acoustic guitar player. Even my young guitar students, who have had trouble learning to tune using other tuners that I love, have no problem tuning with this tuner. I had to tune my guitar and I bought this. I have a guitar with a built in tuner that just doesn't seem to be perfect on pitch. I used to tune my guitar online....

Started to take guitar lessons locally to balance out the DVD's and books, and my teach used a clip-on tuner and my interest went sky high.

Tuning a guitar is difficult for a novice.

Only buy this if you intend to use it with a guitar.
