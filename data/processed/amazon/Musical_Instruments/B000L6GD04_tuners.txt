When I first installed these tuners my guitar would still go out of tune. If you have never used these tuners before , you are in for a treat! These locking tuners are perfect for any Strat or Tele. I have an American Strat and an American Tele that both came with fairly decent non-locking tuners. I've swapped out the tuners and have never looked back...the only question is what to do with the non-locking Fender tuners I have now! If I had to do it over again, I would probably get Wilkinson locking tuners which are much less expensive and a lot easier to install. I ordered these tuners for my Fender Blacktop Stratocaster (MIM). BUT, back to the tuners ... they just made this guitar perfect with holding tuning. But locking tuners are not really for that purpose.FIT AND INSTALLATIONRegarding fit, these have 2 little pins on the backside. Be aware different tuners also have slightly different holes bored for the main peg hole.Typical neck bores for tuners (by brand) are shown on the warmoth site at [...]These are the holes that warmoth uses on custom necks when fitting tuners of various brands:- For Fender/Shaller tuners, its a two step bore, with the main portion being 25/64" and the rest at 11/32".- Vintage style tuners use 11/32"- Gotoh and Grover use a two step 13/32" to 11/32"- Sperzel uses 25/64"- Planet waves uses 13/32"Of course, if you are mechnically inclined, have the tools, and don't mind potentially drilling additional holes in your neck, you can almost fit any tuner you want on any guitar. These are very nice, solid tuners, especially for the price.They do add a little noticable weight to the headstock, but it's not a problem. These replace the OEM tuners exactly without requiring any modification of the headstock. I now have these tuners on an American Strat and an American Tele. The tuners arrived today.

Placed all the tuners in the headstock lined them up with a straight edge and just pressed each tuner very firmly into their hole (with the locking part screwed in tight so as not to damage them) and  very lightly and carefully tapped them with a small rubber mallet to mark my drill points.

Unfortunately, these tuners require drilling to fit my Squier Strat.They look very similar but the two pins are approximately 1/16th of an inch further out from the shaft so I'm going to have to drill new holes in the headstock to use them.

SUMMARYIf you aren't using locking tuners, you're wasting time when you restring.
