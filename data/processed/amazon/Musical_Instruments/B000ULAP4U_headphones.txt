These headphones are amazing! I used my old headphones for listening to music and for tracking in my recording studio. However, when I compare them to my other headphones (Sennheiser HD595's) I find that these are very, very inferior. I think closed-style headphones are just not up to the task of reproducing high quality classical music like open style headphones.I use these at work now. My main headphones before were HD-280's, which I thought were pretty good, until I got these. I am completely blown away with these headphones. Nicer headphones exist, true, but these are the best in their price range in my opinion. This is where these headphones are better than studio monitors, unless you have a well treated room with a good sub. I therefore use these headphones to adjust bass, in relation to the reference songs. But I still think they're the best headphones for mixing and tracking under a couple hundred. These headphones have a very open sound, smooth midrange, excellent detail with out exaggerated treble and very solid, and perhaps a bit emphasized bass.They are extremely comfortable, well made and easy to store. These headphones are wonderful to wear.
