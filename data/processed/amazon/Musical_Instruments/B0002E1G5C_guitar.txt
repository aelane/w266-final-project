Perfect for re-stringing your guitar. It's so much easy to deal with your guitar using this string winder and cutter! I've been playing guitar since the late sixties, and have to say, this string winder and cutter is fantastic. Very useful when restringing a guitar. I have one of these in every one of my guitar cases. Well no, but  it does slice guitar strings in half and it will pull bridge pins and wind/unwind guitar strings, though.If it had a flashlight, tuner and fingernail trimmer it would be perfect, but engineers are mortal and I couldn't put a tool the size of a watermelon inside my guitar case (at least not without coating it with butter first).Its plastic and steel, it will break eventually as everything does - imperfect world, re &#34;breakfast club&#34; bolts fall out, doors fall off, but til then I'll enjoy using this. What a great multipurpose guitar tool. Works great for changing guitar strings. An all-in-one guitar tool that is a must-have for any guitar case! Every guitar player should own this tool. If you are a guitar player and are changing strings like I was without one of these, stop and get one trust me! It will be very useful when installing new guitar strings with all of the items needed for the job.My only issue is the shipping charges for such a small item. Nicely built and very handy to have when changing guitar strings. I purchased this for my guitar lessons studio to teach beginners how to string their guitars properly.To my surprise, I am very impressed with it, now it doesn't compare to a $60 - $100 unit nor is it supposed to, it does it's just quickly and cleanly. I love this guitar string winder.

I restrung my guitar without it and it showed up in the mail a few hours later.

It helps to wind your guitar strings, the grip is comfortable and durable, and once you've tuned your guitar you can clip off the excess guitar string.

He says it's a must have if you maintain and change your own guitar strings.
