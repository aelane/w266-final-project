Pretty great strap overall and I am very very much pleased with my purchase!!! Very nice strap. I ended up switching to their padded strap. I still think this is a great strap and use it on a lighter guitar now. I really like this strap. And $20 for a Levy's Leather strap is a good deal. This strap is very thick and heavy, which give you a good secure feeling. I am very impressed with how nice this strap is. This Levy's Jacquard strap is well made and comfortable.

The $5 strap worked fine but it was scratchy and stiff.

Nicely made strong strap with colorful pattern.

I couldn't remove this strap if I wanted to, well I could but its just too much work.
