This pick holder works for me. I did get those wedgie pick holders and those are definitely the way to go for picks on guitars. Easy to to snap the pick out of it and place it back in. This pick holder is pretty awesome. It is really the best pick holder i ever had. Hopefully I don't lose this pick holder that would really suck because there is like ten in there! There is a red pick that is supposed to say inside under your 'real' picks, which helps with its looks. had one pick inside as a place holder. The pick holder work as described. I have not used the adhesive to attach the pick holder to my guitar yet but it stays attached to the head piece by sliding it between strings from the tuning pegs on the head piece. It's a sturdy pick holder and it gets the job done. This is fine as a general stick-on inexpensive pick holder.

I've found it mostly not useful thus far, maybe it would help more when playing live so I can grab for a pick and know they will be there.

It comes with one free disintegrating pick!

I hated having to put the pick between strings.
