What an amazing product. I would highly recommend this product to any beginner guitarist starting to fiddle with effects pedals, or even a moderate or novice player - It's simply a RELIABLE and affordable way to power your pedal board. This is great product if you are chaining several pedals together. I love this product. great useful product well made quite, and lots of use to view of my floor effects , works great ,, and no other noise from it , buy it . The product works very well; I'm able to power 5 of my pedals easily. I've been using this product for months now and have no complaints. The product itself is plastic, but seems solid, I believe it will hold up to repeated use no problem. This is a terrific product.

It is truly a very nice product and amazingly quiet.

Though the Godlyke product claims 2000mA of power (2amps), this is slighlty less at 1.7mA (1700mA or 1.7amps).
