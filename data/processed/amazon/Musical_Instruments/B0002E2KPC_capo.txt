I had previously purchased a fabric capo for him to use until I could get him a better one. How you feel about a capo has almost as much to do with the guitar you're using it on... What works great on one guitar might not be so marvelous on another... I was using a Kyser capo, until the spring action loosened up to the point it wouldn't hold all the strings down. Liked this capo it worked fine. This capo is small, looks good, and works very well. This capo is lightweight and really tough, it is stiff and takes some strength to open but it stays in place and doesn't damage the necks of my guitars. Both of them sound like there was no capo on. The Jim Dunlop 83CB capo has a powerful spring and works on both 6 and 12 string guitars. Great capo! Needed to re-shift this capo a lot to get it to hold down strings evenly and not mute some. This capo cannot work with it.If I lost it, I would definitely get another just like it. This is actually the first capo I have ever owned, as I am pretty new to playing the guitar. The capo fits nice and tight on all six strings. The capo is sleek looking, and a bit smaller than I was expecting at 3&#34; x 3&#34;, but I have no frame of reference for comparison.Item was shipped on time, and packaged in the original Dunlop packaging.

Anyway, this capo works well.

Pretty basic capo, goes on and comes off easily.

I really like this over the capo that came in my guitar bundle from Austin Bazaar, so after some research online and talking to friends, I bought this capo.It goes on easily,comes off easily and does not mar the finish of my guitar.
