I didn't want to spend too much $$ for a guitar that I wasn't sure if I would like it or not. This was my first acoustic guitar, and I've received some surprised looks about its tone and play-ability -- both from from my luthier (who used to be a tech at Martin) to a couple pro players with 30-40+ years respectively under their belts. It is a cheap guitar that does have some decent craftsmanship, but not stellar.- Good sound! This guitar sounds good, feels good, looks very good.- Matte finish: this comes with a matte finish, not shiny- I like thatCONS:- Strings- corroded poor quality strings- neck condition: Neck has slight bend, I needed to adjust the truss and file a few frets. I've played the guitar for a number of years, some of them professionally, and during that time I've owned guitars by Fender, Gibson, Ovation, B.C. That said, admittedly, this guitar was purchased with the intention of it being a cheap, expendable guitar that was reasonably playable, that I could take with me when I go camping. I'm glad I did - what a nice guitar it turned out to be! The Jasmine S34C NEX is truly an impressive guitar for the price. This guitar sounds awesome and stays in tune very well. This is my 4th guitar I have bought and is by far my favorite guitar. I wanted a cheap guitar I could take anywhere and not have to worry about it being scratched up, except I got the guitar and looks too nice to let get beat up. If this guitar was glossy it wouldn't be as nice sounds stupid but it is true. You have to see the guitar face to face to understand what I mean. This guitar I would recommend to anyone. I have played the guitar for nearly 50 years now, and wanted an inexpensive small-body steel-string guitar to keep out for informal practice and noodling. Bracing is light -- the entire guitar is light. I hadn't played guitar in a number of years and decided to get back into it. I am so jazzed about how wonderful this guitar is, I'm taking online video lessons and learning a storm of chords and fingering techniques! If you're looking for a great guitar at a very reasonable price, look no further. Didn't know much about the guitar, but was quite impressed by the sound and workmanship. It was an exceptional guitar for which I paid $125. But I can't help it - I like this guitar. Quite simply, this is a really nice guitar. This guitar pays better than some 3 times is value! I got tired of flying with my guitar everytime I go visit my parents. He thought the guitar cost $300 above!!... !...My guitar comes in a perfect condition, and I strongly recommended this guitar for anybody! I have been playing guitar for 40 years and I have seen my fair share of acoustic guitars in that time. A very well built, great sounding guitar. I would recommend this guitar to novices and pros. I was not expecting a guitar of this quality for such a low price.
