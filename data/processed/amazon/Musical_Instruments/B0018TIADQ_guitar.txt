Works great for either an electric or acoustic guitar. I purchased this along with a new guitar for my daughter. It cradles my guitar well and seems to be solid. I'm not sure how much I will use it now I have discovered guitar wall hangers, or string swings. I used to just have my electric guitar on the chair behind the amplifier. It really makes the guitar stand out. It is a guitar stand... does what it is built to do... good buy for the cost... My guitar, just Love it! I wouldnt use it for a real valuable guitar but for a kick around gigging stand it should be fine. This is a very well made guitar stand. This guitar stand was very inexpensive and very easy to assemble. Wrestling the guitar in and out of the case when you want to practice is inconvenient. It is much safer to have my guitar in this rack than laying about in the house waiting for someone to step on my guitar.update: January 7, 2013...  liked the first one so much I got two more for my other two guitars. A good moderately priced guitar stand.I had concerns over the foam rubber cushions affecting the finish on my guitar and as a result I replaced them with standard inexpensive vinyl tubing purchased from the local hardware store.A good moderately priced guitar stand. A inexpensive guitar stand that was easy to assemble (1 minute) and holds up well. When I put my guitar on it, it was fine, it held perfectly. This cradles my guitar nicely. The guitar body cradle is very loose and spins around real easy. The guitar does fit on it well and the neck cradle works well.

There isn't much to get excited about in a guitar stand, however, it does it's job and the price was right.

Each adjusted to, and held, its guitar securely.

It cradles my guitar perfectly and is angled just right.
