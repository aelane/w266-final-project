The strings have a nice feel to them.Used the to replace factory strings on a recent guitar purchase.They improved the action considerably. These are great strings. I use these strings for my Telecasters and I have to say the tone is wonderful, beside they last for weeks without turning a different color because of the use. These are great strings and were my favorite until I found Fender Pure Nickel strings. Great strings! Great strings and great value The high strings were plenty of flakes. These strings sound super awesome! the strings are very comfortable on the fingers and sound pretty good the bullet ends work well with the trem on my axe These were the strings I started on a year ago ,and have tried a few different brands in this time frame. I probably change my strings more than necessary so I have gravitated to finding the lowest price strings of at least decent quality.

I've used different strings from D'Darrio to Ernie Ball and now I always use Fender strings.

Also, these are the OEM strings that Fender installs at the factory so you can't go wrong with that.

These are solid strings that never let me down.
