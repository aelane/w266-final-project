I will be handing some of these to fellow guitar players because 25 will last a very long time. I purchased these along with a new guitar for my daughter as a present. These guitar picks are just the right thickness and stiffness for comfortable playing. If you want your electric guitar to sound like Eddie Van Halen, Joe Satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound, then get a BOSS GT-10 (guitar multi effects processor) and install BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg. Excellent guitar picks of medium hardness. Very nice guitar picks for the very fair price. I can always use guitar picks, however these are very pleasing to the eye and have a good quality feel. very nice guitar pics, sound almost as nice as metal guitar pics, very lovely, size was as expected, great sound I bought these guitar picks for my son.

I have played guitar for about 12 years and these picks are now my favorite picks ever.

I'm new to the guitar and I'm just discovering how to use picks and what picks work best (for me) with different guitars and different effects.

These are very nice looking guitar picks.
