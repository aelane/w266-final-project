I don't use a long delay time, in fact, I don't max it out. I wanted a delay pedal but I'm not playing for big money so I had to watch the $$$ I spent. I have countless delay pedals and racks. This inexpensive delay is very special. it's a relatively short delay, which is great for many genres. This one is my main delay and my 2nd delay is a very expensive feature rich stereo delay that is a bit sterile and only sees occasional usage. It's just too bad that they weren't able to stretch out the delay time a little longer, perhaps to 450ms or 500ms. That being said, a digital delay is probably better for that task anyway.But it isn't fair to compare this pedal to an MXR Carbon Copy, and if you're looking for something cheap and surprisingly high-quality to provide ambiance, the Rogue will do just fine.

But if you just need a slapback delay or just a touch of ambience, this pedal will not disappoint!

Analog delay pedals are known to have a warm tonal characteristic.

Compared to my digital delay, the Rogue sounded warmer, although my other delay has a switch for "echo" that made it warmer too.
