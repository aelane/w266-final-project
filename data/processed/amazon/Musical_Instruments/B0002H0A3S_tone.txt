Their tone is slightly bright but not as &#34;harpsichord&#34; as the EXP. The tone feel and bend is what's important. The tone as I say is pretty darn good. MY Taylor recommends Elixr, but the D'Addarios seem to play with a nicer tone on the Taylor and just as important are easier on the fingers! D'Addario Strings Are Simply The Best!The brightest tone, normal lifespan, fair prices,, and louder than the rest!I have played guitar professionally for over 27 years.These strings are the best all around for tone, clarity, punch and volume.Don't be fooled by strings that may last longer or have coating on them just to sacrifice clear tone.One a side note. Beautiful solid tone and no buzzing. ... maybe, but the tone is still much improved going from old light gauge strings to new extra light strings.I'll probably stick with extra light for awhile. Good tone and they stay in tune. These last long, without compromising the tone. They sustain well, great tone, tune well, and last for a good while between changes. Good tone, good sustain, and they stay in tune. The tone of my Ovation was back.Here are my itemized observations:* First, three sets for $13 (currently). The natural tone of the guitar is allowed to shine through, no hint of &#34;tinniness&#34;, &#34;plunk&#34; or &#34;twang&#34;. Nice bright tone.

Crisp tone distinction is just not there.

Crisp and fresh tone for a long time.
