If you're thinking aout buying this guitar, don't. But overall this is a great guitar. But now, even after comparing them to each other, they really aren't that far apart.The Gibson is the best guitar I've ever owned and made my previous comparison based on it. This little Epiphone is an outstanding guitar, regardless of price. If I were to play them each blindfolded I would never guess one was $149 guitar, ever! this is a beautiful guitar...the finish is amazing...and the tone is very clear...if you can't afford several hundreds or thousand for a les paul...this is a fun and very good guitar for the money...has 6 strings,,,from e to e...and if you know the g chord you will have lot's of fun...the volume control goes to 11 ,if you want to kick it up a notch...(only kidding) If you are looking for a Les Paul guitar this is not one. It's still a very nice guitar though. I highly recommend this guitar. The guitar would not intonate due to the ridiculous angle. I don't believe you will find a better guitar, or even close, at this price level.I did a lot of shopping, and considered guitars up to $500 for my first foray into electric. No good!BOTTOM LINE:  If you're shopping for a guitar in this price range, I think you'll be pleased with this guitar. Buy it locally so you can see the exact guitar you're buying, and negotiate to have a setup included, because it will almost certainly need one. Pretty sweet guitar for the price. You literally cannot find a better guitar for $150 than the Special 2.....Sound: 5/5Two passive humbuckers have a great sound with glossy highs, deep lows, and they put just the right amount of dirt on a tone for a gutsy clean or distorted sound.The pickups were wax dipped and did not have the microphone feedback effect.The pickups are high output and feel like AlNico more than Ceramic. This guitar is very attractive looking, and plays well right out of the box. This guitar is a darker cherry red wood color in the center than shown in the picture. Second, if they do decide to stick with playing guitar and eventually own a &#34;better&#34; or more high end guitar, Mexican made teles or strats are great back up guitars for stage use. I'll never pick up my first guitar which is essentially this. I purchased this guitar after much thoughtful consideration of other possibilities, but the nearly universal high marks for this particular make and model finally persuaded me to go with this one, and I do not regret that decision.First of all, it is a beauty. (My guitar was made in China, which may account for the darker hue.) They unboxed a new one for me and WOW this guitar looks AMAZING! He is thrilled with this guitar. I got this guitar at Guitar Center, i was scared to get this guitar from amazon because of a review saying it looked like a toy, so i wanted to see it in person, i saw it, i tested it out at guitar center and it was amazing, its better than my other les paul special ii, this guitar plays great, its set up very nicely, the pickups are very nice, the electronics work perfectly, i have no problems with it, but the guitar is very beautiful, i would highly recommend getting it, i just dont know if anyone elses will be the same, not all guitars are made the same right?

Listen,If you want an inexpensive guitar with great sound and easy playability, buy this one.

If you are considering this guitar, I have to assume you're shopping for an electric guitar at the lower end, not trying to decide between this and a Gibson Les Paul Custom.

Better to inspect the actual guitar you'll be buying, and don't be shy about asking them bring out another one if you don't like the first one you see.I discovered too late that my local music shop would have sold me this guitar for about the same price, but they would have included a full professional setup, including string change.
