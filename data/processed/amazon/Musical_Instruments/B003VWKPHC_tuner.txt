I use this tuner to tune up my violin. This tuner does an excellent job feeling and showing all 4 strings. If you need a tuner, this ones a good one. I bought this to replace the inexpensive Musedo T-50 tuner that came bundled with my Kala KA-S ukulele. Still, it's a very good tuner overall. The tuner operation works pretty well and is consistent on these snarks. I thought this tuner was going to be an oversized cheap piece of junk. But this tuner destroyed those expectations. Its a small, "smart" tuner. Its really cool that I dont have to go hunt down a tuner that could be lost in my room somewhere. This is just the tuner I was looking for! This tuner is very accurate. This is a very inexpensive and very accurate tuner. I bought this tuner mainly for my acoustic guitar; I have a Sabine tuner with a mini-mike but unplugging the tuner from my amp, having the room completely quiet and the tuner in a good position is a couple of extra steps I'd rather not go through. This tuner is compact and works well; I clip it onto whatever guitar I pick up for a quick tune (acoustic OR electric), push the power button, and off I go. This has got to be the best little tuner I've ever owned, and the cheapest too. I have a $100 tuner that works nicely, but this one will handle any instrument you clip it to. This is a great and inexpensive tuner that is easy to use. I bought this tuner primarily for my wife who plays harp (I play guitar). I was hoping this tuner would clip on the top of the harp to make it easier for her.Unfortunately, it doesn't fit on top of our harp. The tuner is rather small which is nice for transporting but the clip will not open wide enough for the top of the harp. The tuner works well in both mic and vibration mode. this tuner is great best buy works so well I highly recommend this Tuner can't buy a better tuner for less money I was shocked when I got this tuner and witnessed how accurate it was. I like this tuner as much as my SN8. I received my tuner yesterday very fast shipping,it looks great,  the price is right, but most of all it works wonderful, very easy to use and small enough to carry in my guitar case. I found the mic tuner isn't as accurate. But hands down this is the most accurate, easy to use, and most portable tuner ever. I bought two more, you will love this tuner. This is a great tuner, I just wish that the clamp was a little bit wider since I mostly have classical guitars and the width of the headstocks can be a little thicker than steel string acoustics or electric guitars. This tuner is amazing, even more so considering the price. It's a fantastic little tuner... The GoGo is awesome and instantly became the only tuner I use. so this was my first real tuner, its very simple to use. one is an inline tuner, one built into my amp....etc... I really like this tuner for the convenience and ease of use. Great little tuner. This chromatic clip-on tuner is the best of the best. I bought this Snark tuner for my daughter to use to tuner her classical guitar and her guitarlele. I've been using a blue Snark tuner for a couple of years and have loved it. The tuner is very accurate and compact. This is a tuner that clips on the headstock of the guitar, and tunes it in perfect pitch. I love this tuner. This is a great tuner. I bought a clip-on tuner about 10 years ago when they were first becoming popular. And this inexpensive tuner is the best one I've ever used by a long way. This tuner is way better than my earlier tunners which relied on either sound to their microphone, or direct plug in for electric instruments. OK, it's a tuner. This tuner is cool. I highly recommend this tuner. Great tuner. I bought this tuner because I am learning to play guitar and want to keep my guitar in tuneGreat little tuner that looks good and works even better It works really well, but not perfectly Like it better than the other tuner I bought, this one was a dollar more and cant remember what the other one was but would defiantly buy this again. This little tuner is so easy to use and see...I bought two more as presents. If you don't have a tuner or are looking for a new one, you NEED this one. I really like this tuner but it is kinda bulky. This is a great tuner. It is far superior to a Fishman tuner that I bought previously. If you're shopping for a tuner give this a try. This is a very versatile tuner! This tuner tunes my guitars very well, it tunes them perfectly, and works well tuning bass guitar, very easy to use, very visible screen when tuning, clamps on nicely, and the red color is very beautiful you could say, all in all very good tuner. Just a great overall tuner.

This tuner is a real good buy at a good price.

It is very sensitive and has been more accurate than a Planet Waves tuner I currently own.
