So when I needed more strings I just got fenders. GREAT strings. I do use other strings on other types of guitars and you can see my reviews on those as well.These are bullet proof. Maybe but IMO these are the best sounding strings I've played with. I use Fender strings and I have used many other brands as well. I change out my strings about monthly and if a particular guitar is being used quite a bit I can go 2 to 3 weeks for hard playing.I started using Fender strings with the Stratocaster bullet strings as they are specifically designed to fit into the tremolo bridge on the strat. You want a Fender to sound like one, and using these strings helps with that. I like these 9-42 Pure Nickel strings ... nice tone, work well on my Stratocaster with Fender locking tuners ... great combo, even with ghost bends, slides, and pounding with Drop D and Open G tuning.

If you're used to wrapped strings, and you like to play blues or classic rock or pretty much anything but metal, these might be all you need to make your rig sound a whole lot sweeter and smoother and just more musical in general.

These guitar strings are nothing special, and based on the amazingly low price nobody should expect them to be.

I put these strings on and compared to the &#34;default&#34; strings, it was almost silky and softer by comparison.I'm guessing the guitar came with steel strings and these are nickel.
