this strap works fine on my Fender Strat. otherwise,  it works for a lower priced leather guitar strap. That is a great strap and has held up wonderfully. I fully expect this strap to match my old one for durability.So why the new strap? Boy does it ever, the new 2.5 strap is really much more comfortable than my old 2 inch model. I almost never do.It's an affordable strap that looks elegant, is wide enough to be comfortable with an acoustic guitar, has great length adjustment range, and rolls up to fit in the case. This is my thrid Levy's strap and it is as good as the rest of them that I have had for a few years. I have this strap in black also and hope this one holds up to the rigors of the others. This strap is a good quality piece of gear you wont be disappointed. The strap is soft. The strap is about 6" too short for my Seagull S6 guitar. I don't quite understand why they don't make the strap long enough to start with other than the fact they can extract another $30 to make it work right in the first place. I will keep this strap but sure feel like I've been had on this purchase... the terms bait and switch come to my mind. Nice strap. This is a simple, elegant strap that inspires envy.

What a nice strap!

The main strap has several slots cut into it, and there's another piece that threads through the slots and then doubles back over itself to lock into place.

It makes adjusting the strap length a bit of a pain, but how often do you adjust your strap length once you've gotten it set?
