I also bought a much more expensive tuner, and I cannot see that it does a better job than this one. I bought my first tuner like this one about 3 years ago, and the rubber pads kept falling off, but I have not had that problem with my new one. Before I bought this I had to use a tuner on my laptop. I love this tuner. This little tuner works fine but the little rubber foot keeps coming off. It's not just a UKE tuner. This is my third Snark tuner, I keep giving them away to people who think they can tune by ear. I don't really see this as a true ukulele tuner without a &#34;ukulele&#34; setting. It's a chromatic tuner.

The Uke tuner here is gloss black, and the Snark-2 is matte red.
