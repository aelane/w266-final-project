I love these tuners. These tuners just seem OK to me. I've been playing long enough to remember when &#34;small&#34; electronic tuners were the size of a paperback book and had prices approaching $100. New tuners like the Snark SN-8(B) are a joy in comparison. Try D'Addario instead; love their tuners. Well they are very good and easy to use tuners, and for not much money (my guitar strings cost more!). The Snark tuners are very accurate and the price on this could not be beat! Great tuners, Ive had the snark 1s i think (the blue ones) and they were really good the rubber part always fell off.

It shows the Super Tight behaving like the other tuners with all of the red bars illuminated along with Green and even a yellow.

I love the Snark tuners but don't know that I'd call it super tight or faster than the older SN-2.

I have had 2 of these tuners (you'd think I'd learn after one).
