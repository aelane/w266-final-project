this pedal is terrific.,,,it is not a pedal to make you sound like an AC-30..the name is somewhat misleading...although you can certainly eq your sound in  that direction....the real treat is the huge variety of boost, tone and gain you can dial in,.,,its mindbending....the gain is superb....not mid heavy like the hideous ibanez tube screamer..,this pedal is an audio swiss army knife... If you want to sound like 5 Dimebag Darrels, then don't buy this pedal. For a pedal that I have stomped on so many times, I'm not even the least bit concerned. I use the pedal as a preamp going into a PA or poweramp. The pedal is hyper versatile going from clean to heavy grind. I have a VFE Alpha Dog and an MXR Custom Badass OD before the pedal. After the pedal I use an MXR phase and Flanger, VFE Blueprint Delay and then a Byang Triverb. Buy the pedal, it's great! Love this pedal!

That's true of virtually any distortion/overdrive pedal, it can be cleaned up with a noise gate/suppressor, and I think the better use of this pedal is on the low- and mid-gain settings anyway.

Wow, I am very surprised by this pedal.

I bought this pedal to use in a min rig as an experiment and I love it.
