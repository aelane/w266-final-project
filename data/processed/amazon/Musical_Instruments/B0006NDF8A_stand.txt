Bought stand as a gift for my son's acoustic guitar. Since he got this stand, his guitar has been put away on it every time. I'd recommend this stand to others, but be aware of shipping, tax and consider the possibility it will arrive with no assembly instructions. This is basically the same as the other stand I rated, just from a different manufacturer. Excellent stand! This stand is great! This stand is very stable and easy to put together. This is a great stand, it looks the same as any other, but it works great for about 10 dollars I'm going to be switching to a 7 stand rack soon for all my basses but I will still keep this around because it holds up well. While it doesn't fold up small like a portable stand, it serves well as a semi-portable stand and is very good as a stationary stand. While it is just a stand, it seems to be sturdy and durable. They might actually be the same stand under different names. If I were to buy a stand again, I would still get this one because it's available under Prime. That gives this stand more value.The stand is very easy to set up. I really like this stand. This stand is sturdy and protects the guitar well.

This stand really isn't an exception.

This stand is light weight and inexpensive because of it.

Not perfect but a solid stand.
