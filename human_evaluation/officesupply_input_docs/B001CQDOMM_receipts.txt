It neatly scans receipts and organizes them accordingly in separate categories of food, retail etc. The receipts easily imported into Quicken as well.A good black-and-white portible scanner for receipts and invoices. Not all receipts are easily legible. My receipts are coming up crystal clear, and no wavering of the image. I've found that even with old receipts, and when I have to enter the totals/payment/vendor/category manually, the whole process, start to finish, only takes me about 1 minute per receipt. On new receipts, it's about 30 seconds from when the paper hits the scanner.I also like that you can tag receipts as you enter them (for business expenses, or any category that you'd like to use for your own budgeting purposes), file based on your own preferred filing system, and easily search.I'd recommend scanning receipts asap, as those thermal ones do fade over time, making it much harder for the scanner to read.I haven't used another receipt scanner, but I do like this one very much and have found it very intuitive and simple to use. Organizing receipts, business cards is no joke. This will let you organize your receipts. It allows you to save receipts for tax purposes, in a nice organized manner, or simply just for your own perusal. Which means it is great if you trying to scan receipts and b&w; documents. Scan in all your receipts and store them in an organized database.You can also scan anything else that will fit through the scanner.It has really helped me get organized and get rid of lots of paper. - most receipts generated now] For those with thousands of business cards, this tool would be a great way to organize, save and then discard the paper version. It takes longer just to scan receipts, and it really doesn't help us keep track of where our money went. Scan receipts as they come in and finalize the receipt. Small receipts are a snap. We are self employed and we have allot of receipts for taxes I have to keep so organizing all of these receipts have been such a pain. If you save receipts for taxes this is a must. I keep thinking that I should have one to scan receipts and important documents so I can have better records. Perhaps I can send my receipts to them...?What's also nice is the unit is tiny and comes with a soft sleeve in which to store it, so it can be neatly stored out of the way. You can organize your receipts using their software.
