The lid is attached so you'll never lose it. The lid is not the removeable tray type on the older style boxes. The lid folds down and is secured with tabs that fold into the convenient handles. Just remember there is no separate lid. The lid is part of the box. Its also nice that you can't loose the lid since its part of the box. Also, they flatten easily and again, you won't loose the lid when you flatten it.Overall good sturdy boxes for occassional access and long term storage. The lid is integrated, easy to close, and locked by folding a flap into each of the carry holes in the sides.The two sizes I tested rated at 65 pounds and 75 pounds each, which is more than enough for  small and medium moving or storage boxes.One of the problems with moving boxes is when the bottom falls out, especially if the contents are breakable. The lid, "locks," nicely, but is in know way secure, so don't think that you are locking something that cannot be opened without a key or by destroying it. Because the lid is incorporated into the box so it's a one piece design, the boxes seem more sturdy and when they are stacked, there isn't any shifting or swaying. It appears that the lid will stay put without tape.The size is large enough to hold quite a few items, but not so big that it will weigh too much once filled. The top lid has 2 tabs that fold into the open handles on the side, but theres no indent to fold them perfectly into the handles, so you have to push them in and get the fold right the first time.
