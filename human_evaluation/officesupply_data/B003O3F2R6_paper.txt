Regular paper is held in place by the pocket on the bottom and a top left side protector. One is to open the D-ring and add 3-hole punched paper. Both loose-leaf and holed paper can fit in this binder. It can also hold additional paper up to a total of 200 sheets of paper.This is a great binder and something that I will gladly send with my kids to school. While putting paper into one of these, I accidentally tore a couple inches of the bottom seam. Even the graph paper is useful. It's lightweight but sturdy and will protect your paper or notebooks. The paper slips around fine for me, does not get caught, and lies flat on both ends. It has 2 plastic paper holders in it, that are easy to put paper into. That means both standard and graph paper, premium plastic dividers with multiple pockets, and divider labels. It comes stocked with paper as well, including graphing paper.
