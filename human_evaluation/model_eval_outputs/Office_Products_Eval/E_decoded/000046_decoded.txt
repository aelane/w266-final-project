i recommend this ink for anyone who's printer is still under warranty. purchased this ink for my newcanon pixma mx882 wireless office all-in-one inkjet printer (4894b002)printer. i've been using hp ink for the last decade and finally gave canon a try since i shoot film / video with canon cameras for my business.
