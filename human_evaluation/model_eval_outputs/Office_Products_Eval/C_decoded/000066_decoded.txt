i don't see a need for one.this would be a 3-star product because it's too fancy, but given how feature-rich it is and the quality of the product, i need to bump it up to a 4-star. the touch screen takes away the zillions of multi touch (fn + something) to mine functionality. the touch screen is a breeze to use.
