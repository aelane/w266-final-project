[UNK] found that even with old receipts, and when i have to enter the totals/payment/vendor/category manually, the whole process, start to finish, only takes me about 1 minute per receipt. on new receipts, it's about 30 seconds from when the paper hits the scanner.i also like that you can tag receipts as you enter them (for business expenses, or any category that you'd like to use for your own budgeting purposes),
