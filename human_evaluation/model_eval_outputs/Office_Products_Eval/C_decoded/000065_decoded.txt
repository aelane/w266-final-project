i liked the size and feel of the handsets with the rubberized edging, which make it easy to hold on to without fear it'll slip out of my hand.cons:- number 2 handset would not hold its charge from day one, i've done all the manual said to do in this circumstance to no avail. i'm not exaggerating when i say i hate this phone.
