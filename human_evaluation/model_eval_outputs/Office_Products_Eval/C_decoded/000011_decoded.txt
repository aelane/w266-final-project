when i first opened this i thought that it would be really heavy duty and perfect for something i use all the time. this wilson jones d ring binder is a heavy duty binder (heavier vinyl covered cardboard). i know this is billed as an ultra duty binder (whatever that is supposed to mean) but i don't find it particularly stout.
