purchased this ink for my newcanon pixma mx882 wireless office all-in-one inkjet printer (4894b002)printer.
this is good ink.
i have always stuck with oem ink, because the results and reliability are worth the extra cost to me (plus printer manufacturers are making it increasingly difficult to use non-oem solutions).however, it is beyond dumb to see the combos that canon is offering for the new line of ink jet cartridges.
