i have seen heavy duty ones before that looked like just another folder, but this one is insanely heavy duty.
i was looking for a heavy duty binder to keep all of my inservice and ceu training papers in one place.
i know this is is supposedly "ultra duty" but it doesn't truly feel all that heavy duty to me...
