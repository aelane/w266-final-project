it can also hold additional paper up to a total of 200 sheets of paper.this is a great binder and something that i will gladly send with my kids to school. while putting paper into one of these, i accidentally tore a couple inches of the bottom seam. even the graph paper is useful. it's lightweight but sturdy and will protect your paper or notebooks.
