My phone plan comes with voicemail so having a traditional answering machine is pointless.The sound quality and ease of use were great. Since the GE phone I've been using was on its last legs, and having had very good experiences with Motorola in the past, I jumped at the opportunity to test out theMotorola DECT 6.0 Enhanced Cordless Phone with 2 Handsets and Digital Answering System L702. Easily this is the worst phone I've ever used, mainly because of the convoluted design of the functions.The only pro:- I liked the size and feel of the handsets with the rubberized edging, which make it easy to hold on to without fear it'll slip out of my hand.Cons:- Number 2 handset would not hold its charge from day one, I've done all the manual said to do in this circumstance to no avail. I'm not exaggerating when I say I hate this phone. The phone system is effective as a basic phone and answering machine. Maybe we could build a new phone in America!!! It has phone screening capability and 30-entry phonebook (will be nice if this has 100+ entry phonebook). * Each phone allows for 5 different redial numbers.Things I don't like:* The phones are designed with no curve to contour to your face. * Depending on how the phone is positioned on your ear, one can have difficulty in hearing the person on the other end. This phone was SO easy to use-- you just plug it in and play Even the time sets itself. But then I realized that each phone is meant to be personalized for a person - it has intercom, and transfer between handsets, stuff like a family in a larger home would love.
