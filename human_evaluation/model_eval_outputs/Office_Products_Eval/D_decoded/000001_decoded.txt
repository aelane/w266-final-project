it takes longer just to scan receipts, and it really doesn't help us keep track of where our money went. scan receipts as they come in and finalize the receipt. small receipts are a snap. we are self employed and we have allot of receipts for taxes i have to keep so organizing all of these receipts have been such a pain.
