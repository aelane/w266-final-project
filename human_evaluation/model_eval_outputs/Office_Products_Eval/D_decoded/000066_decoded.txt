the screen provides wysiwyg display of your label layout as well as some control via its touch-screen soft buttons. it has a touch screen, which, while nice, has finite use for me. it works but sometimes the screen does not react the way you want it to and you have to repeat some actions to get it to register the input. it has no screen or keyboard; it only prints what your computer tells it to.
