i need the ink for my printer but i hate paying so much. i have always stuck with oem ink, because the results and reliability are worth the extra cost to me (plus printer manufacturers are making it increasingly difficult to use non-oem solutions).however, it is beyond dumb to see the combos that canon is offering for the new line of ink jet cartridges. it's ink! i am going to try some generic ink to compare.
