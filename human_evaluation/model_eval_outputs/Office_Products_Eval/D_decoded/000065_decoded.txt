* depending on how the phone is positioned on your ear, one can have difficulty in hearing the person on the other end. this phone was so easy to use-- you just plug it in and play even the time sets itself. but then i realized that each phone is meant to be personalized for a person - it has intercom, and transfer between handsets, stuff like a family in a larger home would love.
