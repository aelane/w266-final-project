good sturdy boxes for occassional access and long term storage. the lid is integrated, easy to close, and locked by folding a flap into each of the carry holes in the sides.the two sizes i tested rated at 65 pounds and 75 pounds each, which is more than enough for small and medium moving or storage boxes.one of the problems with moving boxes is when the bottom falls out, especially if the contents are breakable.
