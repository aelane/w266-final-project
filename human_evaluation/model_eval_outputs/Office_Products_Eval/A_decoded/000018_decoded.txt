the lid is attached so you'll never lose it. the lid is not the removeable tray type on the older style boxes. the lid folds down by folding a flap into each of the carry holes in the sides.the two sizes i tested rated at 65 pounds and 75 pounds each, which is more than enough for small and medium moving or storage boxes.one of the problems with moving boxes is when the bottom falls out, especially if the contents are breakable. the lid, "locks," nicely, but is in know way secure, so don't think that you are locking something
