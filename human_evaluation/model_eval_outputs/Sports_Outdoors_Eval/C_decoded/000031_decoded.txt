i purchased a second from amazon as a backup, and the new model does have some differences, but they are all improvements. there are many pockets, and sometimes i forget what is in them. back pockets has flat survival pack with sundry items. they both have outer pockets to hold mres, water bottles etc. however it has mesh pockets for holding small items.
