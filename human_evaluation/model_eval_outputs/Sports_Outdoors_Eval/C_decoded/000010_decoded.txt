the mask allows for clearing water out of it through the nose piece as shown in one of the videos.the snorkel does the nice work of not filling with water when going down, but if some water gets in it may be so little that it will not be a problem to clear it while keeping the snorkel in place.together the parts add up to a system without flaw.
