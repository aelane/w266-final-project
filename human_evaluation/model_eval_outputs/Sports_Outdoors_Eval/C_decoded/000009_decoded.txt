it has an edge but i couldn't cut yogurt with the dang thing. so even if you paid $6 for it you are going to have to send it out to get a real edge on it which will probably cost you $3 for shipping and $5 for sharpening. i would recommend once you get it to refine the edge a bit so its as sharp as possible,
