so far it holds an excellent edge (makes it hard to sharpen that first time) even when chopping frosen wood. crappy edge, slack cord for handle, didn't say survivor on it (i don't like not getting what i see in the pic) but for this price, i'm forced to give it 4 stars. did take an edge, seems to be durable and up for abuse, and the firesteel works. keeps an edge alright.
