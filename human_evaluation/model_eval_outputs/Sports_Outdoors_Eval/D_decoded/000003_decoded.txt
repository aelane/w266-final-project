originally purchased this product for use on an inexpensive crossman 2240 pellet pistol, which comes from the factory with relatively crude iron sights. battery replacement can be accomplished without removal of the sight - another nice feature. i have also left the battery in it for quite a while... like a year and still powers up with no problem.
