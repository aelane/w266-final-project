the mask fits my face wonderfully, and stays on (for testing) without a strap, which is something the guy at the snorkel shop told me to do this summer. the mask also has side windows, which give a bigger field of view, but i'm not the biggest fan of that because it lets stray light in and can lessen visibility in some situations.the fins are great, work well, and sure do make catching up to fish a lot easier.
