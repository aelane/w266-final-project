i appreciate the low price.
it's a great price, unless you receive it broken you really can't complain about a 9.99 price point for a bike accessory.i can't speak for the glossy/shiny finishes but i ordered the black which is a flat black incidentally and of course when it arrived it was chipped off in numerous places and the silver shines through really voiding the whole purpose for black.
but again at this price point, even walmart has nothing comparable, so i'd just buy another.
