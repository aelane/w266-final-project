i would recommend once you get it to refine the edge a bit so its as sharp as possible, mine came pre sharp but i put a better edge on it.
they needed to be sharpened when i got them as they weren't very sharp but they seem to hold an edge very well.
it have a fairly sharp edge and the fire starter works fine also.
