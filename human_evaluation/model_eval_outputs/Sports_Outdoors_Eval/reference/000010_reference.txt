so i would not choose this as my primary mask, but i'd bring it along as a backup, just in case.all right, you need to know that there is no way to know if a mask is a good fit for you unless you can try it on.
if you use a mask that lacks this feature, you have to turn your head to see what's off to either side...not a big deal, but the mask i've used for the past 30 years had this option.
the mask is great.
