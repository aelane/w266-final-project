Getting it to hold an edge is an exercise in frustration. I had to sharpen it when it arrived, but it's keeping its edge well. Cutting edge is medium-low quality, but if you have sharpening skills, you can produce a serviceable utility edge with relatively little effort. It have a fairly sharp edge and the fire starter works fine also. Once given a decent edge, it's perfectly serviceable for minor tasks.Recommended. It holds an edge fine and is constructed very well. Holds an edge pretty well (invest in an inexpensive pocket sharpener), but when it dulls it's easy to get back to razor sharp. The edge is not that sharp from the start and probably won't ever be, BUT for a knockaround knife that you don't mind beating up on, it is just fine. It can be sharpened to a decent edge, but I'm not sure how well it will hold it. It came with a fairly dull edge. It comes dull but it took a very sharp edge quickly. It has an edge but I couldn't cut yogurt with the dang thing. So even if you paid $6 for it you are going to have to send it out to get a real edge on it which will probably cost you $3 for shipping and $5 for sharpening. I would recommend once you get it to refine the edge a bit so its as sharp as possible, mine came pre sharp but I put a better edge on it. They needed to be sharpened when I got them as they weren't very sharp but they seem to hold an edge very well. The upper edge of the sheath pocket that holds the fire starter was unraveling so I weld-sealed it, and that fixed that. So far it holds an excellent edge (makes it hard to sharpen that first time) even when chopping frosen wood. Crappy edge, slack cord for handle, didn't say survivor on it (I don't like not getting what I see in the pic) but for this price, I'm forced to give it 4 stars. Did take an edge, seems to be durable and up for abuse, and the firesteel works. Keeps an edge alright.
