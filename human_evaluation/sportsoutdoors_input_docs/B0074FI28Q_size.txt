Problem is, its too heavy for its size. I personally like the size of the Chive for opening packages and mail at the office. Heavy for its size, yet not uncomfortable to carry. However, It is the perfect size with all the options I look for in a folder. It's really heavy for its small size. Good size for comfortable pocket carry. Great knife good size. As I mentioned earlier this is a good size knife with good balance. Great size for Every Day Carry (EDC). It's a little heavy for its size, and sometimes it pokes me in the hip when I sit down. The size is perfect for EDC. Knife size, design and appearance is ok but came dull and am having a hard time getting a sharp edge on itReally not liking this knife. Like the size,quality and color..its perfect for me.its a good product and sturdy material,love it,will buy it again.thanks very much! I have to say for it's size it is heavy, but that is to be expected considering the materials. Perfect size for everyday carry and everyday chores etc. Some Kershaws are too wide, and some are too narrow, but this one is in between and seems like the perfect size for a quick draw from your pocket. It also is rather heavy for its size, which may be good or bad, depending on your preference. I was worried that it may be too small but it feels and looks much bigger than the actual size. It's very ergonomic, and is a decent size for edc.
