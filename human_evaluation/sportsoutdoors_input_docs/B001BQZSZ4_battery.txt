so i have to remove the battery to avoid it from draining it completely. then i went out and discovered the battery was dead. Inserted the battery, the dot looked more like a constellation in the night sky than a dot, little dots all over the place. Popped in a battery and within a few clicks had it target centered. I have to adjust the battery compartment because if it's too tight or lose the don't wont light up. I checked the battery and even replaced it and it didn't help. Oh, they do give you an extra battery too. With new battery this scope works fantastically. I am still on the original battery. The extra battery supplied is a nice extra.I originally purchased this product for use on an inexpensive Crossman 2240 pellet pistol, which comes from the factory with relatively crude iron sights. battery replacement can be accomplished without removal of the sight - another nice feature. I have also left the battery in it for quite a while... Like a year and still powers up with no problem. The extra battery is a nice addition since it's easy to forget to turn the scope off after using it.
