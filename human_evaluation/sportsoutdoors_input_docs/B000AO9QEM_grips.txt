These Sunlite MX 1 Foam Comfort Bicycle Grips Black were easy to instal, just cut off the old grips, put a little soapy water in side the new foam grips, and slide them on, wait a little while to dry, then your good to go. Nothing bad to say about these grips. These grips are comfy and easy to install. It's beyond me why it's so hard to find bicycle grips with this much cushion, these days. I had to hunt around for these grips for hours - paging through all sorts of internet listings until I was satisfied that these ones had sufficient padding for my purposes. I wanted cheap comfortable grips and these are fine. They are very lightweight and would appear to be fragile but, they are very tough grips. These foam grips are way better than the overpriced ergonomic grips. There are better foam grips out there. I was looking for grips that would help reduce/eliminate the vibration I was feeling through the handlebars from my 66cc 2 stroke engine. I ordered 5 different grips from different manufacturers, and these were the only ones I kept, while sending the rest back.
