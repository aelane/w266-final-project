One of the spokes nearby always had a low reading. I have bladed spokes and it still works fine When I got the Park Meter, I checked all the spokes. Once you know the spokes are in the ballpark, you can start to true from there. You can mark the spokes by spinning the wheel and putting tape at the same "centered" spot, or you can do what I did, and use the spoke wrench as a bottom of the meter guide. I've used the &#34;pluck the spokes to tune them&#34; approach for years with good success. Recently though, I had to replace several spokes and could just not get the wheel true and also get a perfectly round wheel. I re-tensioned all 32 spokes, checked for alignment, made a few adjustments and ended up with a perfectly true wheel. Adjusted the spokes to the averaged amount so now the spokes are at equal tension for each side of the wheels. I know that I feel a LOT better knowing that my spokes are not too tight or too loose -and that the relative tension is even all the way around the wheel.There seems to be two schools of thought reading the other reviews. And then tested my spokes, wrote down Max and Minimum. After I checked all the spokes, I used the spoke tension chart as it gave a suggested range to tighten spokes. I adjusted all the spokes (and checked the runout at the same time). It still sounds ironic to say but spokes break from inadequate tension causing fatigue failure. The spokes should all have the same tension when plucked.
