If you use a mask that lacks this feature, you have to turn your head to see what's off to either side...not a big deal, but the mask I've used for the past 30 years had this option. So I would not choose this as my primary mask, but I'd bring it along as a backup, just in case.All right, you need to know that there is no way to know if a mask is a good fit for you unless you can try it on. If, however, the mask bleeds air and falls off, then there is a breech someplace and where air can get it, water is also likely to get in.Back to the review...This mask has a built in purge valve in the nose (I don't like this). The mask is great. Also, the mask allows for clearing water out of it through the nose piece as shown in one of the videos.The snorkel does the nice work of not filling with water when going down, but if some water gets in it may be so little that it will not be a problem to clear it while keeping the snorkel in place.Together the parts add up to a system without flaw. The mask has "Panoramic lens technology for expanded visibility". The mask allows the user to purge the water that may get into the mask.The fins are easy to size, and it find them to be comfortable in and out of the water. The mask feels great, but again, I've not taken underwater. The mask fits my face wonderfully, and stays on (for testing) without a strap, which is something the guy at the snorkel shop told me to do this summer. The mask also has side windows, which give a bigger field of view, but I'm not the biggest fan of that because it lets stray light in and can lessen visibility in some situations.The fins are great, work well, and sure do make catching up to fish a lot easier. I will stick to the mask I already have.The snorkel mouth piece was comfortable and fit easily even though I have a narrow mouth. The mask, however, was too small to be comfortable and I had trouble getting and maintaining a seal. The mask is just too small for me, and compared to how well the flippers fit, it seems like the wrong size was put in the bag. I just wish the mask was larger -the material is soft with a double flange seal and a purge valve, and the lens gives a good range of view. I'm just very surprised at how small the mask is. The mask is good but I have used much better. The mask is comfortable and never leaked, but did not have the clearest visibility in the water. This mask has good visibility but was a bit cloudy in the water. I gave it four stars only because the mask can seem a little cloudy in the water compared to some of my other masks. It is very similar to (or is) a Lux mask, which is one of U.S. The mask doesn't fog up, and is wide open, allowing me to see in all directions, including up and down. The mask it self  has a panoramic view so you can see of the side without turning your head.One of my favorite features is the integrated whistle near the mouth piece. Which is a mask strap cover and snorkel cover in one. They make it much more comfortable and prevent the mask strap from pulling hair.This would be a great gift for someone who enjoys water sports but its hard to shop for. The mask fit his face with no leakage and he said the mouthpiece was comfortable in his mouth. The mask really had a nice snug fit however it seemed to fog up easily so remember to pack a de fogger. Normally you clear by pressing the mask to your forehead and exhaling through your nose.

The mask is great.
