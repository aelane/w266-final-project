Great price too. The price is tough to beat on these and for the price I don't think you'll find a better looking or lighter bottle holder for the price. The price was good. The price was right, so much that I'd buy this cage again any number of times (I'm already considering buying a 2nd one for my bike). I appreciate the low price. Good price, too. For the price, it looks anything but cheap - the plastic is quite flexible but strong, and it installed quickly with very little effort. good price. It's a great price, unless you receive it broken you really can't complain about a 9.99 price point for a bike accessory.I can't speak for the glossy/shiny finishes but I ordered the black which is a flat black incidentally and of course when it arrived it was chipped off in numerous places and the silver shines through really voiding the whole purpose for black. But again at this price point, even Walmart has nothing comparable, so I'd just buy another. This is a great price for this item online. I price this item at store not online and it was higher in store than online. Good price, same as most of the other aluminum water bottle mounts, but looks a little cooler and more aero... They look expensive without the ridiculous price of other lightweight options. Excellent price, looks sleek and aerodynamic. can't beat this for the price, all bottle cages seem to work fine, but this one is very light, well priced, and handsome. I'll buy more for this price. This is highly recommended for this price, fit my specialized These are a great price and hold my bottles well (for road riding). For the price, its great, and in my case is mounted adjacent to my Colnago carbon one that came on my new bike.
