There are two side pockets accessible easily that could hold rifle or pistol mags, survival knife, camera tripod, or antennae/radio comms. The other pockets are generously sized as well. The two side pockets offer even more storage and a low profile when compared to clipping on water bottle holders, etc. I think I am still discovering pockets on this thing. there's three pockets in the main cargo area, the top pocket has a webbed separator, and the outer pocket has organizer spaces for pens, external HDDs, zippered web pocket... pockets everywhere.I liked the first one so much, I purchased a second from Amazon as a backup, and the new model does have some differences, but they are all improvements. There are many pockets, and sometimes I forget what is in them. Back pockets has flat survival pack with sundry items. They both have outer pockets to hold MREs, Water bottles etc. However it has mesh pockets for holding small items. The outside pockets hold bulky items better, and the rear top compartment is big and useful. I may end up cutting some of the larger pockets out to save some room and weight. The pockets are great, and I am happy to use as my BOB or if your inclined a SHTF bag.
